32,"WOW! This is a major league book of hotness!  I love reading about the bisexual men as much as the menage, etc.  Two men who can pleasure each other AND admit a female??  I'm so there!  At $2,  it was a great way to introduce this author to me.  DEFINATELY purchasing more by Ms. McKenna.  Brava!",positive,book

62,"Drew finds out from his girlfriend's reading material that she has m&eacute;nage fantasies and decides to make it a reality for their one-year anniversary. He enrolls his best friend Brody to be the third partner, unaware that he's got some kind of thing for Sidney. While she's at first a bit startled, Sidney accepts this ""gift"" and things go amazingly well...at first.The m&eacute;nage scenes are definitely well done but more importantly, the story that deals with the complexity of everyone's feelings and the aftermath is even better. Everyone's perspectives are offered and woven seamlessly for such a short story. I really enjoyed it and plan to read Brody's story next.",positive,book

133,"Some reviewers said this wasn't a story, merely a sample. That's not try. It's a novella, a SHORT story. Yes, it IS short. The reviews already said so. But it's a good story, though it's twisted and deranged. A lot of people probably won't like it. But it's really not bad, if you can get past the graphic aspects thrown in. I like the book, even if it's odd and somewhat disturbing. :)",positive,book
148,"Even though I am not a cat lover by the time I finished this book my feelings for Miranda's cat had certainly changed. When I first started reading this book I intended just to read for a short while, taking a break from a hot day, but I ended up reading the entire book in one sitting!I loved the setting and the way the author made you feel it could almost be anywhere in the world. Portions had me thinking of Canada while other descriptions made me think of places in Wales and Scotland. Plus who wouldn't like to live in a lighthouse.If you enjoy magic and mystery you will certainly find this book engaging. The twist at the end was wonderful and I did have my suspicions but not until much later on in the book.  This is a book that I am sure to read again!",positive,book
175,"I look for bundled series for the Kindle and was pleasantly surprised with this one. A historical fiction featuring a heroine that is coming into her own, it manages to have romance without dragging sex into it too much (so far in the series) and a plausible mystery.  It manages to keep the heroine within character for her timeline rather than making her a modern-day woman in a corset and bustle.",positive,book

The chemistry that builds between Nora and Tom when they are stuck in the cabin together is great.

311,"I enjoyed this story by Kallysten (as I have all that I've read by her).  Brett is human and the owner of On The Edge, a club that caters to both vampires and humans.  Lisa is his vampire lover and silent partner.  They have a good relationship, one that isn't the usual vampire-human one in that Lisa hasn't bitten Brett (she doesn't want to see him as food).  She is on the hunt one evening in the club and is surprised to see Leo, her old lover and fellow vampire.  She couldn't remember why they had parted 15 years ago but found it wonderful to be in Leo's arms again.  From this point on, (no I'm not going to spoil it for you), you read about how Lisa, Brett and Leo develop a relationship between themselves.  It is a hot and spicy read and I am looking forward to reading the next story, Over The Edge, that continues Brett, Lisa and Leo's story.I received an ebook from the author for the purpose of an honest review. All comments are my own and I was not compensated for this review.",positive,book
314,"Woohoo, just added another series to my library list.  This is exactly the kind of books I like:  dominant alpha male possessive over his mate.  Tienan is a trained killer, but he feels a protectiveness towards Silence from the moment they meet.  And of course, the meeting was perfect.  Silence was tracking him to give information to the leader of the Resistance (her adopted brother), but the hunted became the hunter.  And the game is on!!  This was a very good read.  Anyone who likes dark cold mysterious guys who finds that one woman to soften them, will love this story.  Now I'm moving on to the second story in this series.",positive,book
391,"Dylan Gennaro is a beta werewolf who spent years under a vicious alpha who enjoyed nothing more than hurting others.  It isn't until his friends and new home is threatened by Alan Matthews does he finally take a stand and kill his former pack leader.  Even now in is new home of Red Rock and under a much more kind alpha, Dylan is still pained by is inner scars from his previous life.  He does not just want to sit around and be taken care of by others but wants to help and be of use.Sasha Wallace watched as her mentor was savagely murdered and left with a few scars of her own but it's the ones that she can't see that hurt her more.  The citizens of Red Rock make her feel nervous and is under constant watch because of her magic.  One of the few that is able to calm and make her feel at ease is Dylan.  He saved her life and sees her as more than just a witch.  With every passing moment that they spend together, their attraction for one another grows.  But will Sasha stay in Red Rock long enough to explore her desire and feelings for Dylan or will she flee the moment she has repaid her debt?Dylan has been a character I've been interested in since the beginning of the series.  He is unselfish and will do whatever he can to help in the war with his former pack in Helena.  My only complaint is that I think he takes on too much of the blame.  He blames himself for what happen to Abby (story in Cry Sanctuary), her sister Brynn (story in Sanctuary Lost) and for the entire war.  It isn't until Sasha comes in that he finally takes a break from the self blame and his character becomes more than it has been.  He is not an alpha wolf but Sasha brings his wolf closer to the surface and I like that.  Sasha had been badly hurt and is terrified but with Dylan she is able to relax and feel safe and confident again.  There is some fight when it comes to admitting how she really feels (isn't there always?) but together, they begin to heal each others wounds.  I think what I like most about their relationship is that Dylan isn't dominate like an alpha would be toward his mate.  Not that there aren't protective instincts in him and he does want it known she is his, its just since he is more gentle with her the relationship is more charming and sweet than the ones in the previous books.Their relationship isn't the only event going on in the book.  It is brought to everyone's attention that there is an evil vampire working against them in the war.  Dylan and Sasha along with Joe and Brynn are sent to seek help from a vampire friend of Red Rock's alpha Gavin that lives in Maine.  When they get there they see that the pack has their own crises they are dealing with that includes an alpha trying to take over the pack and a female vampire that has an eye out for the blood and power inside of Brynn.  It was good to see Joe and Brynn again.  I enjoyed reading their story in Sanctuary Lost and I like to see my favorite characters make an appearance.  Brynn suffered a lot in the previous book and I liked that her and her struggle were included in this book.  I think I would have been a little disappointed if it wasn't.This book has a bit of everything.  Action, romance, steamy love scenes and sarcasm which is always one of my favorite things to read.  Sanctuary's Price is the third book in Moira Rogers' Red Rock series and is so far my favorite.  Each book is better than the one before and I have yet to be disappointed by anything from them.  I'm addicted to their characters, story and the world they built.  I can't wait for the the next installment in the Red Rock Series, Sanctuary Unbound.  Two words, lumberjack vampire.  Yup, not making that one up.",positive,book

438,"Simply put, this was been the best .99 novel I've read yet.  Solid writing, excellent pace, non-cookie cutter characters - who wouldn't love a protagonist with an opium addiction?  I want to have a beer with Mr. Tangerine.  And the cover?  What's wrong with the cover?  It's a beach, get it?  I would have paid $4.99 and not been disappointed.I don't understand what everyone wanted at the end?  Some big confrontation with the mine setter?  A shootout that ends in the death of the evil doer.  C'mon people, what's wrong with changing it up?  A little variety; an odd twist.",positive,book

543,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much, as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels, he was surprised (""Why didn't they make them into movies too, Dad?"") and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them, and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4, and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper",positive,book
554,"This is not a criticism. Knowing (and loving) Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin as I do, it made the stories even more enjoyable for me.Just like Wolfe, Wistril is rotund, loves to eat, loves to drink beer, and spends his time reading. He also, just like Wolfe, says, ""Bah,"" ""Pfui,"" ""Flummery,"" and ""Confound it."" Not to mention they both bellow.Archie, as Kern, does all the legwork and gets all the best wisecracks.  He even takes a stack of papers out of his desk, just as Archie does.We had horrendous thunderstorms today, and it was a perfect time to lose myself in the land of Kauph with Wistril and Kern and all the gargoyles.

559,"Very brief story.  Enjoyable but not a lot to it.  The hero and heroine have been married long enough to fall into a rut.  The husband, a twin, has always wondered whether his wife might have preferred his brother (because the twins had swapped places a couple of times during the married couples courtship because the husband has always felt less socially adept than his twin).  The heroine has always been able to tell the difference between the twins and has never doubted she married the twin that she wanted to marry.  Still, they've settled into comfortableness and she wants passion (and she fears her husband may have strayed --though he hasn't).  Over breakfast she makes an outrageous statement about possibly taking a lover, jolting her loving if inattentive  husband into action.Nice story. Loving couple. It's just a short story, however.",positive,book
574,"I have read all seven books in this series. Apocalyptic/Adventure is one of my favorite genres, therefore this series is a good fit for me. I enjoyed the optimism coming out of tragedy. Also, the martial arts scenes were very well done. I am looking foreward to more books being added to this series. I have found that Mr. Sides is an excellent story teller. The characters become better defined with each book. If you do not enjoy action and adventure, with an apocalyptic twist, this is not the series for you. On the other hand, if you do like that kind of story, this series is well worth the time and money.",positive,book
591,"This was a different ""end of the world"" synopsis. No zombies, pandemic, or virus. You can guess- it is a fog. The  children grow up as young adults in this book, which I found wonderful! A refreshing read. You will see the endurance of the human spirit and can easily see what could happen in these circumstances. Not the ""fog"", but if any children were left to their own devises for a long period of time.Several people have made negative statements about a kid of 16 pairing with another, about age 27 years old. That would not be uncommon in this type of setting. The amount of people in this story are limited. Also, sexual desires often takes precedence over what would be considered normal. I never make comments of editing. I know any author is doing the best he can afford at the time.",positive,book
602,"Dealing with testy moral issues like assisted dying and euthanasia is never easy - but the story weaves these together with compelling arguments for and against in the guise of a tale that begins with a Grandmother's letter to her dropout net-surfing journalist-wannabe grandson and pits him with (initially) and then against his new romance; a human rights activist who turns out to be the very kind of person that the inventors of the Death Trip want to be rid off.Dealing with how society sees the burden of care being paid for and dealt with - our main character Chuck is torn between blowing the story of the big evil Pharmaceutical Company that wants to euthanise the undesirables and prove the activist right, or believe the softly insidious entreaties of the idea behind the science and the advances of the owner's daughter, with whom he has a torrid affair.A good story that walks the line between the issues well but does have an almost deliberately rushed ending, as if a Sequel was the obvious answer - I would still definitely recommend the Author.",positive,book

But Tad refuses to give into his wolf and a meaningless liaison, his human side and principals rule too strong. And so he fights every day to bury that part of him. Until the girl he once loved shows up and turns his world upside down.Missy Leason is running from her pack and almost out of time. A viscous alpha wants to claim Missy and use her for her Omega powers, willing to break both human and wolf laws if that means a rise in his own power. Missy hopes that Tad can save her but that means confessing secrets and convincing him that they're more than just first mates, they're true mates. But when Missy's Alpha finds them she may not get the chance because Tad must face him in a fight...without the ability to shift into a wolf like his adversary.Wolf Flight was another great story from Vivian Arend, this time starring Robyn's (Wolf Signs) brother, Tad. With suspense and action that will keep you turning the pages for more and naughty sex scenes with frustrating tension, Wolf Flight had a fuller feeling to it then the first book in the series despite it's shorter length.Tad and Missy's story almost run side-to-side of Robyn and Keil's time-wise, so you get to see Tad's feelings on his sister's mating as well as his own. A sweet and likable character, I really enjoyed Tad. Missy was also a good character, determined and aggressive when it came to getting what she wanted (Tad) yet still soft and womanly.

971,"Set in futuristic Vegas, we find that ""Sin City"" has lost none of its debauchery and in fact has only added to the reputation that anything goes. When Payce Halligan is assigned a new partner she is understandably horrified, working alone has created a bubble where she is not responsible for the life or death of someone close in her work. After being responsible for the death of her prior partner and love she has hardened her heart and does not plan on changing that any time soon.  However, since she does answer to the head of the Las Vegas Police Department she gets no choice in the matter.Her newly assigned partner Gavin McAllister is a good looking trainee with a faint British accent. He is an addition to her work she is not sure she is ready for.When they are called out to three separate crime scenes, all with the same M.O. they find themselves on the path of a fanatical serial killer. Each of the victims is a young woman, hung upside down and crucified, left to bleed out and with initials carved into their bodies. The ritualistic killing makes Payce think of the Amazon Casino where Costumes are still used so this is where their investigation begins. Little do Payce and Gavin know that they are about to become the hunted in this bizarre fantasy being followed by a madman.PI Barrington brings to life a very real future. Her characters are very likable and have a great sense of humor even in the dire situations that they find themselves. The story is fast paced and hard to put down, move over J.D Robb, here comes another look at the future. A gritty Las Vegas is an exceptional setting and P.I Barrington has a knack of making you feel like you are there. This is a great book to ad to your library, you will love the interplay.

1099,"This was a short, entertaining read. I don't know that I'd classify it as erotic but it is a steamy fantasy story. Dardanus is definitely an anti-hero and not exactly likeable in the beginning. Because of the short length of this story, it's hard to say much without giving away spoilers, but The Knife's Edge is a sensual read about Queen Nestra and Dardanus. While many in the kingdom seem to consider the Queen fragile and not deserving of the throne (Dardanus is one of those people at first), she's a woman looking to give up control in the bedroom, trust someone for once and have someone see her for herself and not her title. Even though the entire story is told from Dardanus' point of view, all that came across clearly which I think says a lot about Ms. Draven's storytelling ability. I was completely engrossed in this story and if this is an example of her writing, I will definitely be looking for more by her.",positive,book

1131,"It doesn't matter that she looks as if she stepped off the pages of Penthouse; Hailey Jennison is socially inept when it comes to dealing with men. Currently her only glimpse of sex is the Friday night peep show her and her friends partake in. A construction worker across from her friend's apartment could put a Greek God to shame with all the muscles that adorn his body. Gage knows that the source of all his wet dreams for the past six months is part of the female group who ogle him every Friday night as he prances around in the nude. Deciding to take a chance he finds himself blackmailing the blond bombshell into a dinner date. Now all he has to do it keep his mouth from ruining the best shot he's ever had at love and lust combined.All you need on a blistering cold day is a hot cup of chocolate and a steaming hot book to cuddle up with. Enjoying the Show provides the steam with whipped cream on top. A total chick book with its quirky comedic parts: a group of women who put the ladies from Sex in the City to shame and a man even a grandmother would drool over. I found myself with an uncontrollable grin as I read how two beautiful people with less than stellar social graces came together for one fiery encounter after another. Marie Harte did an excellent job creating two characters, Gage and Hailey, you couldn't help but love as you laughed at their growing relationship. The added plus for this book is Gage's family; if only we all could grow up with such an eclectic and open mix.Indyreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

1452,"When I found this on audible I gave it a try. I had read positive reviews about the series and decided to listen this sequel. First of all,if you are like me, probably you will need to listen to it twice. The first time the initial ten minutes were confusing and I couldn't follow the story.  Kept listening and began to like it, especially when she is at the hospital and interacting with Lydia.  I decided on listening again and now this series is on my radar. The premise of Soul Screamers is interesting.  Kaylee gets this uncontrollable desire to scream.  Everybody thinks she gets panic attacks but it is something more. Her situation has a supernatural motivation that I find curious and I want to know more of this character.About the characters:I find Lydia a potentially great character. She is intriguing. She has an ability that could help Kaylee but I can't help but ask myself at what price to her own safety.  At the other side of the spectrum I see Kaylee's aunt.  She doesn't sound like someone Kaylee grew up with.  I don't feel to much empathy toward her.About the narration:It took me a little time to get used to Amanda Ronconi's style.  At the book's beginning she sounded detached, almost informative.  Her voice sounded in third person although she used pronouns ""me"" and ""I"" in her narration.  As the audio progressed she definitively was Kaylee.  As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I listened to this audio twice.  The second time in my listening, Ronconi sounds detached at the same parts as well.I give a 4 to the story and a 3 to the narration.

The chemistry between these characters was compelling and very steamy. i particularly liked the heroine and her kindness as the new queen.If this were a full-length novel, I think i would feel more invested in the characters and I could see this being a 4.5 or 5 star for me.

1562,"The Good:This was a good read with super hot love scenes and a surprisingly sweet premise.  Yes, there's some stuff that's hard to swallow, like that the super handsome hero is a virigin but miraculously knows all these awesome moves, however that's a pretty small part of the story.  I liked the fact that he was sweet and shy and reluctant to approach Jenny, but as soon as he does, sparks fly!The Bad:I honestly could have done without the whole attempted rape scene because it felt forced and unrealistic, but I guess that was really just so we could see why Will ended up the way he did.Bottom line:This is the first book I've read by this author and I'll be checking out more of her work for sure!",positive,book
1581,Great book~ it's about lost loves that reconnect. Hot sex scenes ~ even a threesome which it hot hot hot!

1673,"This was an entertaining, funny book and a fast read. If you're looking for a mindless, light escape for a few hours, this can fit the bill. However, I found the lack of editing a bit distracting. There were grammatical mistakes, typos, verb tense changes, etc. scattered throughout the book. I skipped over most of them, but some tripped me up while I was reading. However, given that I got this book for free, it was worth it.",positive,book

1755,"I totally enjoyed this story!  I get a little frustrated with all the comments about editing during reviews, maybe we should start critiquing the art work on the cover next.  The reason I read reviews is to see if the novel will be interesting to read.  We are all very fortunate these days to have the excitement of e-books and indie authors.  This means that we get the freshness of new authors, some of them so determined to get their story out that they will type it out on a phone.  That is just so cool to me.  Big deal, there are a few typos, a few misspelled words,  (probably from auto editing, which I love to hate) but the main thing is the STORY!  This is a good one, I would probably give this book 5 stars, except it reviewed for 3 when I read it, and the next book in this trilogy is rated a 4.5, the third a 5, I want to have some where to go.  Times like these I wish there were 10 stars to review with.The story was fantastic, the characters were great, and the plot was very creative.  This is a really enjoyable book.  I don't really get why some people rated it so low.  What is not to like?  The main character is a nice likeable guy,  and the rest of his crew are good people too.  The bad guys, well some are truely bad, there are some not as bad, bad guys too. The plot can seem pretty simple at first, but like all good books, the plot swells & grows as time passes.  I would feel that any zombie lover would be missing out if they didn't read this book, I am so excited about the next 2 that I already bought them both.Read this book, you will absolutely be glad you did!",positive,book

1873,"Cassie Jordan may be newly engaged but that doesn't stop her from thinking about the two men she left behind.  That's why she's heading back to her hometown in rural Idaho to confront her memories and feelings once and for all.Nice guy Kyle Watson and dark and brooding Alan Caine have known Cassie since she was just a little girl.  They'd been inseparable and as they grew up their feelings inevitably changed to a deep-seated desire which none of them addressed.Eventually Kyle and Alan's feelings result in a sexual frustration that needs to be assuaged so they turn to each other.  Unfortunately Cassie witnesses their encounter and jumps to the conclusion that they've chosen each other over her.  It's been three years since she last saw either of the men and she learns they now live and run a ranch together.  Kyle and Alan aren't stupid, they realize that Cassie would never choose one of them over the other so they'd agreed to share her - that had been before she'd run away.  Now that she's back it's up to them to convince Cassie that they love her and a relationship between the three of them could work.Sierra Dafoe has definitely won over many readers with her warmhearted, tender storylines.  Cassie, Kyle and Alan's unique relationship fascinated me because the men waited so long for Cassie to return to them.  Their love for her is obvious in everything they do.  One of my favorite things about this story is the differences between the men and how that plays into how she responds to each of them.  THE BOYS BACK HOME is a quick read that certainly doesn't lack for emotional impact or sexual tension.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book
1880,"I've read this book a couple times, mainly because I loved it so much. Everytime a new book in this series comes out, I start again from book 1. I loved this story because it takes place in an entire town of shifters. That's right, almost everyone is a shifter and you can't even find the town unless you are some how connected to it. Like Rachel, her aunt died and she's come to town for the reading of the will. Rachel doesn't realize it, but she's a special kind of shifter, like her aunt, she can choose which animal she turns into. Burke is the leader of his own pride and doesn't yet have a mate. Rachel's aunt was the keeper of the totem, which protects the town and helps keep outsiders out. Together, they must find the totem and find each other in the process. This book lays the foundation for the rest of the series and honestly I think it's one of my favorites. I would HIGHLY recommend it!!",positive,book
1895,"I like David and Jeremy from the earlier books in the series, namely Hidden Force and A Helping Hand. I am glad the abused David gets his HEA and there could not be a better choice than Jeremy to help this tormented man to heal. But close to 58% of the story is sex which is just too much for me. How do I count this. If you read it using Kindle it is easy especially when the first sex scene stops at 33% of the book. So while the sex is well written it is just too much. And why does a guy has to finally top or bottom, when he is reluctant initially, just to prove he is finally ready to take the plunge in a gay relationship. I like the plot, which is like an extension of the story in Hidden Force, and the guys. But this one just has too much sex even if well written.Hidden Force is still the best in the series.",positive,book
1910,"This book didn't really go the way I thought it would.  For one, I expected more action overall with the fact that Griffin is being hunted and I also didn't expect him to find out about Jarrah so quickly.  The dystopian society was a nice touch but I would have liked some more detail about it to make the backbone of the story a little stronger.  Overall I liked the story but, honestly, I think it would've been better if there had been more conflict; really the entire thing was just too EASY and that's a shame because I could see the potential for a more in depth story.",positive,book

Devin, afraid of living the hellish life her parents lived, is gun shy when it comes to commitment and decides moving in with Erik is going too far too fast so she dumps him.The chase and capture is funny as all get out!

2026,"Lissa decided to ignore her queer feelings about getting on the hotel shuttle.  She needed to find another position, and it was the only way to make it to the job conference.  What follows next is a near death experience that changes her life forever when a gorgeous vineyard owner rescues her.Atticus Maxwell is a vampire enforcer who's lived for centuries, yearning and hoping for the One to bring meaning to his life.  Meeting Lissa knocks him out of his ennui once he's awakened to an all encompassing love.  Could she be the One he's searched for?  Once it's learned that the accident was no accident, Atticus does everything in his power to ensure that Lissa stays alive long enough for them to explore all the possibilities.Most of the vampire novels I tend to steer towards are usually dark, violent, brutal and brimming with lurid sex (think JR Ward), which makes them not quite as emotionally romantic as One and Only.  This delightfully sweet paranormal romance carried an ""R in Romantic"" timeless vibe.  Sure the sex is sensual, at times even naughty, but the amiable warmth here is old school.  It's not in the bodice ripper class; there's definitely violin and piano music serenading reader heartstrings.Atticus is noble and honorable with that air of Byronic tragedy that makes him vulnerable without being a stuffy wimp.  When he opens his heart and life to the equally lonely and engaging Lissa, I was so glad they finally found one another.  There's a tender thread throughout that works well with themes of friendship, loyalty, and hope, as well as the continuing battle of good vs. evil.  All in all, I was left with a pleasant feeling, which means I'd like to see where this series goes.  Bianca D'Arc does well setting everything up for the next series installment, and I'm positive that she'll more than deliver on it.  If that doesn't convince you, take a look at the mesmerizing delectable cover.Patrice F.Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

While its a bit short and because of the story wraps up fairly quickly but overall I enjoyed it! Well written for sure,some parts keeping me on the edge of my seat wondering. Its a great progression of events with a serious plot twist in the end which I won't ruin of course! The main character is mysterious and enigmatic he drew my attention the whole way and of course the trials and tribulations of his love interest as well. As with any story I wanted it to be longer but of course all good things end. Well worth my time and money",positive,book
2109,"I really liked this book. The characters were well-developed and the story believable. It kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. There's a lot of sadness in Phoebe's life, and it doesn't look to get much better until a stranger offers his friendship. The characters are much like I would imagine they would be in the time period in which the story is set. I had to remind myself a few times that this story was written when women had few rights and were at the mercy of the men in their lives, as well as their surroundings. It was extremely rare for a woman to be able to live a self-supporting, independent life in those days, and I would imagine many had few or no close friends. This book made me want to reach into the story and clobber the bad guy, rescue the girl, and chastise the ignorant family members. I recommend it to those who like a clean romance that's not too mushy and a story with substance.",positive,book

It was so good I didn't want to stop.The writing, formatting, editing, etc. were terrific and what I have come to expect from Mr. Konrath's novels.The action was tightly written with no extraneous detail.Terrific from beginning to end.The Bad Stuff:None that I can think of.This isn't really a criticism, but I would have liked to have more background on Taylor and Donaldson (I'm bad with names, hope I got those right.).  I always like to know the 'why' behind a serial killer. But, that's just my personal preference. It definitely did not affect my enjoyment of this gruesome story.Overall:If you liked Serial at all, you will love this even more. It's not quite as gory, but there's a time and a place for everything. This novella hits the bull's eye for action/suspense fans who like a little blood and gore on the side.",positive,book

2302,"Where to start?  I wish I had read TIDAL WAVE sooner.  I loved Alexia and Joshua.  In fact, I believe that, after the ""dream"" scene betwixt the two, the childhood memory is one of my favorite parts.  It's so cute and innocent, and I think Vivan really captured how a young boy would act when being teased by the older boys in his family.  And then Alexia's innocence during the entire interaction... It made me smile.My all time favorite part of this book definitely had to be the scene when the two sleep together for the first time.  It's so tender... so loving.  I really got a sense of Joshua's love for Alexia, and I absolutely ADORED the fact that he would risk getting in trouble just to keep her safe.  Love love love!I wasn't entirely crazy about the dominance switch about halfway into the novel.  After Alexia rebukes Joshua for lying, it's like his character transforms from a dominating alpha into a little kitten with the alpha lurking under the surface... which is cute, but he simmers down in the bedroom a teensy bit.  And then Anthony, who was initially the little kitten, transforms into this dominating sex god.  Kind of weird, but hey, who doesn't love a guy who's confident in bed?  Plus, he did it for Alexia--since he knew she was too shy to start talking dirty--which makes him that more respectable in my eyes.Anthony had to grow on me, especially since I was shipping Alexia/Joshua from the start.  I'm not entirely a fan of threesomes in stories, however, this series--or more specifically, TIDAL WAVE--has made me a bit more open-minded about reading it.  But only by Vivian.  She doesn't make her sex scenes tacky.I loved the fact that, despite the story's length, there was plenty of room for character growth.  Alexia transformed from this shy, mortified creature into a true leader.  It was fun being able to witness that growth, and it was written eloquently.Just like all of her other stories, TIDAL WAVE ended on the perfect note.  I was absolutely satisfied with everything about it.  And Anthony kicked the bad guy's butt.  Woot!If you're like me and you don't read a lot of threesome stories, for whatever reason, TIDAL WAVE is the perfect introduction to this type of reading/writing.  Like I said, the sex isn't tacky, and you could tell that Alexia and Joshua really cared about each other (they were pretty much the ""main couple"" in my head, but you see the love with Anthony also, but I personally didn't find it as intense as Joshua's).  Definitely worth adding to your TBR piles.",positive,book

Despite his objections, Federal Agent Trey London insists he needs protection.  Jackson is attracted to Trey, and Trey seems to feel the same, but will Jackson live long enough to do anything about it?Court Appointed takes the stereotypical ""important person needs protection and falls for the bodyguard"" story and gives it an interesting twist.  Making both parties men changed the dynamic of the story considerably, especially when Jackson thinks Trey is overreacting or treating him like a woman.  Sexy, determined Trey and stubborn Jackson are both likeable characters.  The love scenes are hot.  The suspense angle was well done for the most part, and coincidences and red herrings kept it interesting.  Really, the only flaws in this book were Jackson's father, whose over-the-top, controlling behavior seemed a bit much, and the resolution of the stalker angle, which I thought was abrupt.  Overall, Court Appointed was a hot and entertaining read, and I give kudos to Annmarie McKenna for turning an old romance clich&eacute; into something new.Cassiereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

This was a great turn on the Beauty and the Beast plot,the sex scenes were hot and I actually like both the hero and the heroine.Don't get me wrong I wanted to slap the hero's face a time of four due to immature and often cruel behavior, but the author did such a great job with developing Hunter's character and weaving in his reasons for acting like a tyrant that I forgave him in pretty much the same vein as the heroine.  And he really redeemed himself at the end.Of course it was hard to stomach the heroine's self-sacrifice, but if she didn't then this book wouldn't have been a take on Beauty and the Beast.

It did not add anything that enhanced th story. I have no recollection of any pedophile priest in the time of the birth of Jesus.************SPOILER ALERT!**************I find it interesting how the asteroid is depicted as the guiding star at both birth instances.

3066,"This is an interesting story about the mystery surrounding who will inherit Castlegate Manor.  There is a scheming cousin with pockets to let, a mother trying to marry-off her daughter without losing their station, a daughter trying marry her love and avoid marriage to said icky cousin, a beautiful young woman masquerading as a lady but without the proper pedigree, and a protective groom that seems more than a mere servant.  All the characters play an integral part in discovering the secret and unraveling the mysteries of the Manor.  Even a dead great-aunt influences the action as the story unfolds.I like the chemistry between the Hero and heroine.  It is a chaste relationship but the sensual tension is there; you can sense these two are drawn to each other and are fighting to keep their hands to themselves.  I also like that the h is as nice as she is smart and truly regrets any subterfuge she feels compelled to enact.  She is pragmatic and realistic but yet still has dreams of 'what could be' in her life.  The H is terribly masculine and a leader from the outset in spite of his lowly position in the stables.  The reader can guess fairly early who the groom likely is but figuring out the penultimate mystery keeps one turning pages.  The villain is truly nasty so it's easy to root for his comeuppance and there is plenty of tension and suspense as the action resolves over the last chapters.Without giving anything away, I feel some readers will say it is pure fairytale how the author deals with the disparity between the classes in her story.  History records several instances of courtesans and actresses marrying into the peerage, but the circumstances in this book make overcoming societal constraints highly unlikely.  In this story the servant is known in London and the peer is not high-ranking enough to pull off ""ignoring what anyone may say,"" especially as the resolution of the mystery would lead to much speculation in the Ton and most likely publication in the papers.  There would be no way to hide who married whom and what rank they were prior to the marriage. As a firm believer in the concept of true love and the adage that love conquers all, however, I do see these two characters marrying anyway and weathering the storm, retiring happily to the country to live their private lives.  I say disregard the fantasy of the match and just smile over the hard-won HEA.This was a sneaky little charmer of a book.  The writing style was clean and concise and the author kept the pace moving steadily throughout the book.  The secret was not terribly hard to figure out, but it was still worth reading to the end to see how the story would play out.  This was a nice, clean, light read for a Sunday afternoon.",positive,book

Leaving behind Kyle Watson and Alan Caine, the two men she loved more then anything.  Ashamed by her feelings for wanting two men and unable to choose between them, she was even more distraught when she accidently saw them making love and it became clear that neither one of them wanted her.Cassie couldn't have been more wrong, Kyle and Alan wanted her more than anything and their world was broken when she left and now it's totally turned upside down now that she's back.  Can these three people face up to their feelings and hold on to the world that slipped away from them three years ago?The Boys Back Home was sweet and loving. I liked what the author wanted to do with the story but I couldn't help feeling let down with the progression of the story.  Cassie, Kyle and Alan are fantastic characters but I felt the story didn't live up the characters potential.  I felt The Boys Back Home moved way to fast from the time Cassie came home and reacquainted herself with Kyle and Alan.  Assumptions were made and three years of uncertainly was dissolved away in less than a day.  I did like The Boys Back Home but I would have like to see more of their life together, however the short epilogue was fantastic.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

Some have won their battles while others have lost it. The last few chapters were so hard to get through.This book was written in such a beautiful way it was hard to put down. It's a very heart wrenching story. I've read 2 other books by Maria Rachel Hooley and they both made me cry.I have to say the ending was beautiful. I didn't expect it to end the way it did.

3409,"Second book in ""Dakota Heat Anthology"". Preceded byHer Dakota Men. Followed byDakota's Cowboys. Note thatDakota Heat, Volume 1appears to contain the first two of 4, in paperback.Plot:To save her brother from jail Samantha appeals to the owners of Dakota Ranch. Shayne and Jackson see something more in Sam, someone they want to protect, love and maybe even have a future with. With a little loving, respect and patience it might even be possible.Comments:- Contemporary Cowboy erotica with menage (threeway) sex.- 2273 kindle locations, 31739 words- Sex is m/f and m/f/m - very generous and loving, caring, gentle and all about her. No m/m. Aiming for a committed threesome.- While ""Dakota Ranch Crude"" is part of an anthology, it isn't a *series*. These books are in no way connected and can be happily read independently.Opinion:Although the suspense is a little wussy, the romance is very sweet and the sex terribly HOT. Shayne and Jackson are sexy Alpha-types, but not so overwhelming that they smother Sam. Sam has strength, character, and intelligence - when they order her around she listens, takes it on board and understands why they are making these demands. No one is demeaned or treated as a child. They all take an intelligent, thoughtful approach to their relationship and respect each other. It's Nice. And when they come together, it's Hot. An excellent book. Recommended.Aside:Although we have strongly Alpha men who like their woman to follow the rules they've put down for her ""safety"" and ""own good"", they are no where near as Dominant as the men of Brooke'sDesire, Oklahomaseries. If you are looking for that style of book, this anthology is not for you. There are no bdsm aspects, no Domestic Discipline on principle, and the menage relationships are private rather than a societal expectation. Rather we have a good set of menage novellas with strong romance, steamy erotica and mild suspense plots. But they aren't in Desire.-CR-",positive,book
3421,"This was very well-written, in a romantic style.  At times, the author romanticizes war, then vilifies it.  Not that he is confused, I think that's how they related to things in that period.It still amazes me, and angers me, as a Belgian, how Germany managed to survive as a nation.  To call them brutes or barbarians and murderers is not enough.  What they perpetrated on Europe in two world wars is beyond comprehension.  After viewing the wanton, unnecessary, almost childish destruction caused by the retreating Germans, the author actually hopes that one German city will be levelled entirely, as punishment, retribution, and as a lesson to future Germans that wars of expansion in Europe are unwanted and will be avenged.  This did not happen.Author tours the French and British trenches and rear areas, giving amazing insight into the French military psyche at the time.  That part, I enjoyed the most.  People who ridicule French military prowess have no idea of what they speak, and are, certainly, no students of history.",positive,book
3468,"This story was not like the other books I've read from Kallysten in the past. I found it difficult to engage in the story at the beginning. However, once I stuck it out past the first 5 or 6 chapters, I was pleasantly surprised. I found that instead of the instant sex appeal and gripping tensions with characters that immediately immersed me in the past, it was a story that read like a slow burn, gradually building up layers of complexity, and personality in all the players involved. By the time I was half way through the book, Kate's issues were personal to me, and I was rooting for them to find a way to make it work. I actually cried towards the end of this book, and that's an incredibly rare thing for me as a reader. So although it took me longer to get into the characters and their story, it was well worth it to keep it up, and see it through to the end.",positive,book
3470,"Once upon a time two cousins, Colin and Beckett de Saxby vied for the affections of the lovely Christiana. After they are grown things change. Beckett becomes the Earl of Dareford, Colin fights as a knight and Christiana works her lands under the Earl's care, while Beckett turns down every offer for her hand.When Beckett decides Christiana must move back inside the castle walls she reluctantly agrees. Then Beckett takes her to his bed and masters her with his touch. Times are turbulent, though, and an evil nobleman is taking estates in an effort to undermine the King. A masked man known as the Blacksmith fights back.When Christiana is kidnapped the Blacksmith comes to her rescue. What follows next is a maelstrom of events at the castle that threaten to break both Beckett and Christiana's hearts.The Heat of the Knight is a tantalizing tale of love and lust. Beckett is a tortured hero that appealed to my romantic soul, and his love for Christiana was genuine. The heat in the title is aptly featured in the story with scenes of m/f/f/f and anal sex. I highly recommend The Heat of the Knight for those who like their historical romance mixed with a great deal of erotica.Note: The Heat of the Knight was previously published and has been revised from its original release.AmeliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",positive,book

Running from her ex has her moving from place to place after several months but for the first time she is unable to remain detached from the people around her.  To complicate matters even further, she's falling for her boss and has witnessed his death in a clairvoyant vision.Ex-Special Forces operative and owner of Turner Industries, Kyle Turner III, knows everything there is to know about Aislinn.  He's had her carefully investigated and he's perfectly aware that she never stays in one place for more than eight months because of her abusive ex. She's been his personal assistant for the past six months and he'd desperately like to get to know her on more `intimate' terms.  An anonymous email warning him that somebody would kill him in a kitchen gives him just the advantage he needs.Kyle's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities.  Kyle's decided that it's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore.  Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself.  She even turns down dinner with him, until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she doesn't go out to eat with him then he'll have to go home and eat in his `lonely kitchen.'  He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and isn't above using it to his advantage.  It's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship.  Kyle's positive he can protect her  . . .  all he has to do is prove it to her.  Simple right?  Well, maybe not quite as simple as you'd think.Annmarie McKenna's TWO SIGHTED will delight readers with the fun array of characters, witty conversations, sexual innuendos, and enough suspense to keep you riveted to the pages.  I loved the intensity of the relationship between Kyle and Aislinn.  And I got a kick out of her friend Christina and Kyle's `groupies' as she refers to them, Jon and JT, playful banter and sexual interest among the three of them.  Ms. McKenna does a wonderful job blending emotional situations into the plot so that you genuinely care about what happens with each character and never want the story to end.

4876,"As the book description describes, this is a collection of 6 novels that are part of a vampire series.  The first five books revolve around a group of vampires and their Chosen as well as a despicable branch of the CIA known as DPI.  We follow them through the trials and tribulations of love while being hunted by the DPI.  The final book that is part of this collection revolves around another vampire and his Chosen.Each of these stories were well-written and I found myself fully pulled into each story.  With the first story, I became involved with the characters and really grew to love them as the stories continued.  In the first five, each story built on the last one and I got to know each previous character more than before as well as be introduced to know characters.This box set is a highly-enjoyable read and I look forward to the reading the second set as soon as I can afford it.  For those who love vampire stories, this collection is a refreshing change from the plethora of vampire novels on the market.",positive,book

4883,"There are, perhaps, a few places where the characters' past history and current personalities might not stand up to close scrutiny -- but the turns of phrase are quite deft, and the characters are simply _fun,_ so I'm not inclined to quibble. The faintest besmirching of the overall entertainment is a duel which has a slight jump and feel of ""insert duel here"" in the author's notes, but that's the only part which got my mind hiccuping.The other reviews cover details quite well enough, and the bits that I really, really liked, I can't say or it'll spoil the snickers. (There is quite a fair dose of humor here and there!) Unfortunately, the first of those is just _after_ the sample text ends.",positive,book

5013,"When Jillian discovers that her nutty sister Sabrina has hired a new company, We Kidnap U, to conduct the custom kidnapping of her fantasies, she tries to talk her sister out of it.  But Sabrina's not listening and Jillian figures she'll have to bail her sister out of yet another jam - like she's done her whole life.  When Sabrina drops everything to join a new boyfriend on a boat in the Key's, Jillian steps in once again to take care of their mother's diabetic cat.  However, leaving the apartment building, Jillian is bound, gagged, blindfolded, thrown into the back of a van, and pleasantly molested by her sexy captor.  Jillian quickly realizes that Sabrina forgot to cancel the kidnapping before leaving town.  Unable to tell her kidnapper that he's got the wrong sister, Jillian submits to the first part of Sabrina's fantasy.  Once the gag is off, Jillian decides to see Sabrina's fantasy kidnapping through to the end.  Maybe it'll be a happy ending for Jillian and her new Master.This is definitely an escapism novel - a fun little story to read around the holidays when you're looking for something a little naughty.  The author writes well, but don't expect an excessive amount of character development or wooing.Jillian and Kyle, the captor and our hero, are well-matched and complement each other's personality.  It was certainly interesting to see their characteristics develop while she's gagged, bound, and/or begging.  As a plus-size woman, I appreciated that Jillian was comfortable in her body at a size 18, even if she did gripe about her weight a little in the story.  I think any woman who feels that they are less than perfect will feel a little hesitant when faced with a  gorgeous hunk who's going to make their fantasies come true - whether they like it or not.There is some BDSM in this story, but it's pretty light when compared with some other novels out there - so keep that in mind if you're looking for something hardcore.  This story deals mostly with domination/submission, bondage, toys, wax play, and double penetration.  I was sort of torn on the safe word issue.  In all my reviews, I mention how important a safe word is for both parties involved in a scene.  Were this real life, Kyle should have asked her to repeat her safe word before any of their play actually began.  However, since this is definitely a fantasy novel, I didn't deduct points for that.The story is maybe a 2 hour read and, while I enjoyed it a good bit, it's probably a little overpriced.  Overall, I'd say it's about a 3.5 for me.",positive,book

5076,"Rating: 4 stars - Loved ItHuge Thank You to CS Maxwell ~ Where's My Muse? blog for having King Cobra (Hot Rods #1) on her blog. Jayne Rylon has a new fan. I read a review that Eli and Alanso have a cameo in Hammer It Home (Powertools #6) and decided I would read the Powertools series in order before I read Eli and Alanso story in King Cobra. Nope now I will be reading King Cobra next as I am loving Jayne Rylon writing style and wow does she now how to write a scorching sex scene. Plus I do not think now I can read 5 more novels before.As for Kate's Crew I loved it with 5 sexy men and their power tools. Seriously crushing on Mike, a tattoo construction hero. There is no build up to their relationship since the story is a short novella but Jayne Rylon has a way of letting the readers know that Mike has been after Kate and she has been dodging him all summer with their dialogues and emotions. The reason she has been dodging him all summer is because she does not want to lead him on as she has a fantasy of doing the naughty with his partners. She does not know that Mike has one rule, never mix emotion with pleasure. Loved her character as she was direct with him about her fantasy.Mike and his business partners like to play. Wow! The play well together. Warning do not read in public, as will be squirming in your chair. The first sex scene is a scorcher, exciting and different. Kate's Crew has it all in the sexing department. It has M/F/M, M/M, M/M/M/M and M/M/M/F. Even though I loved how the sex scenes start off with just a few characters but then lead to more joining in as they are hot but felt they were a tad long for a short novella. I would of liked them cut back a little and had more of Kate and Mike. I will admit had to read a few times to get what the heck they were doing with so many characters. Fell in love with all the business partners and look forward to reading the rest of The Powertools series.Originally posted at Wickedly Delicious Book Blog",positive,book
5117,"Ava was just looking for a distraction when she came upon Derek. On vacation with nothing but forgetting on her mind; she is awestruck when she spot Derek walking solo on the beach below her balcony. What starts here is a romance of white hot chemistry that will carry readers through this short story at lighting speeds. Both main characters are scarred, but what they find together offers the light of hope for happiness. Both carrying reasons to forget leads them to a hopping night club where they will fall into one another's arms desperate for a release. What they find is far more than a night of forgetting, but rather someone that all of the past scars have been leading them right too. I love this story!

5172,"Cade has 16 facial piercings (Elliott counted) and is on recycling duty as part of community service for trashing his ex's car. Elliott is there for possessing stolen property (bought a stolen purse). They both grab an envelope with tickets for a concert and agree to meet after to decide who gets them. Elliott is the opposite of rude, pierced, tattooed Cade. He's 10 year's younger, a travel agent, ""nice boy"". Yet he's fascinated by Cade and when a few nights later Cade invites him to a concert he goes against his better judgment. Cade's piece of crap car breaks down after some weird concert and they are stuck in the mountains in the winter. They end up getting down in the back seat and after finally getting home kind of settle into seeing each other. Cade is Elliott's first (beyond BJ's) and things are going well until Cade runs into his ex at the concert they found the tickets for and he freaks and tries to give Elliott the brush off. Something I thought was interesting which is not usually touched on was that Cade's ex had been having unsafe sex and he'd been tested but had to wait until his 6 month test came back clean. I always understood that you needed that 6 month window but I know in most books once they get that first test that they are clean everything is bareback city. Anyway, I love me some tattooed pierced bad boys and the opposites attract thing. There's really not much to the plot, just the guys trying to form a relationships, Cade's insecurity at Elliott's youth and what that will mean. But when I want a comfort read it's a go-to for me.",positive,book

Like the earlier books in the series, it's more like a short story but it's just long enough that nothing is left incomplete. I don't think you'll get lost if you don't read the earlier stories in the series first but those stories do provide a better understanding about the heroine Belle and why she is in her current predicament. If you do get the rest of the books, I agree that they should be read in order. I wish the author would write faster as this is one addicting series. This series reminds me a lot of Shelley Laurenston's shifter books which I also love.",positive,book

It is a little different to the wolves and kings certainly and perhaps even a little slow, and often almost convoluted.

They are both strong and bold, and Raven is spellbinding with her diverse personalities, and those in the background already tempting us with intrigue.

5394,"I really liked this book. It was very well written and the story was immediately engaging. I have to admit that I really hesitated to purchase this book due to the cover. I have become so disgruntled lately with a lot of the junk that is out there. Needless to say, I am very happy that I purchased this book.The story was very good, though I have to admit all the fighting and life/death situations did become tiresome toward the end. The characters were very believable and Wulf was a HOT! HOT! HOT! Alpha male. Very possessive and protective and did I mention HOT? His growling did become ridiculous and I laughed at how often it was mentioned. Waaaay too much - though I like some growling.I really liked reading about a kick butt alpha female who wasn't about to fall into bed with the hero just because of biology and I loved it when she ran away from him forcing him to chase after her.  It was very entertaining and then, damn it, she decides to give in to him with no further effort on his part. I enjoy a story where the hero has to work HARD to secure his woman and sadly, this element seems to be missing in so many romances. There was some of that here but not near enough, in my opinion.Overall though, this was a great book by a talented author and I do recommend it. If you like science fiction romance, with a hot alpha, you will like this book.",positive,book

But Jolene wasnt anyways the tough Deputy Marshal. Six years ago she was a sweet and nieve 20 year old who thought she'd found the man of her dreams and married him. Less than a year later she was a widow and as hard as she's tried she hasnt been able to be with anyone else since. When an attempt is made on her life and she is shot the Marshals put her in protective custody but an elite Army team takes her from there to a secret Army base where everything she thought she knew about her husband and what happened to him is a lie.Turns out her husband isnt dead after all. Paul Benate is one of those freakinly smart men that works soley on Goverment top secret projects. He knew 6 years ago he had no business getting involved with Jolene but he couldnt resist the strange pull she had on him. He decided that she was to innocent and weak to be able to handle what she would have to being his wife and chose to let her believe he died. But now that his worst fear has come to life - a terrorist wanting to kidnap Jolene to get him to coroperate with them - he has no choice but to have her brought to him.The new and improved Jolene doesnt take her husbands deception well.

5483,"The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the relationship between Dylan and Sasha gets off to a rough start. It seems awkward and juvenile somehow - as if they are both teenagers. It took the first whole section of the book to get me over this feeling I had of them. Although I liked Dylan from the first book he just seemed weak to me - I recognize he has that own opinion of himself so the self-talk he engages in certainly doesn't help the impression. His actions spoke louder than his words and I was convinced there was a great story for him and I was right!Now granted being around all those ultra alpha wolves was bound to cause issues but the mindset shift you have to go to in order to see Dylan as a sexy leading man is actually substantial based on how his character has been written. Or it was for me. I can't help it - he always comes off as like someone's kid brother.That said, however, I remain extremely impressed with the writing in this and the other novels in the series. By about 40 percent or so in I was fully in Dylan's camp and the relationship that started so off kilter had me completely invested and clicking away on my Kindle. Even Sasha starts coming across as a young woman with a purpose and power - before she just seemed too victim-ish. Sending the young couple on a road trip with Joe and Brynn was brilliant - and left a wide open opportunity to focus on them alone which was greatly needed.I cannot deny that the introduction of the vampire Adam was a huge plus in this book. I absolutely adore him already - his humor, his passion, his honor, and his complete understanding of what he is and what he is capable of. Now that's a character with bite (pun intended!)This is a series that is best read in order as the plot flows from one book to the next - moving the story along. I like it a lot - because there is an authenticity in it regarding power and the corruption it causes. There are many human paralell's here.Fans of paranormal series romance should pick this one up.",positive,book

Although the story was mighty short, I was still entertained. And, the sex scenes were great. Who doesn't like those uninhibited, freeing, honest sexual experiences? Good god...

5542,"This is one of the top 5 Harlequin Presents books I have ever read, and I have read a lot of them. I think the best part of this book is that it is presented in a new way.It doesn't have the normal plot of jealous ex's or false pregnancy claims on the hero. This book shows how far a family is will to go to follow traditions and what they feel is in the best interest of their family even at the expense of hurting those involved in the deception. It shows how much Luc is willing to give because he regretted his past choices of those he believed wouldn't do him wrong. I loved how Skye wasn't selfish and realized how much Luc was sacrificing, even though he told her he didn't care. It shows how much she truly loves him. She took the initiative to try and correct past wrongs even though they were against her. It takes a lot of courage and love to do what she did. I am so glad that I took a chance at buying this book.I highly recommend this book, especially to those who are tired of the same old Harlequin plots.",positive,book

5626,"The story begins with our heroine, Becca, putting up a display in a museum. She has never really been comfortable with her life and is completely obsessed with the pirate she's about to put on display. That pirate is James Morrow, who did a lot of his pirating in the early 1700's. Becca was so obsessed with the age and the pirate she even learned how to fence. So, as she's putting the display up, she decides to test a sword that came with all the other items, thus taking her back in time to Captain Morrow's ship. I didn't realize when I purchased Treasured that it was sort of a Time Travel novella. I may not have purchased it had I known, but I am quite happy I did buy and read it!Apparently Becca could basically have been twins with James's wife Rebecca. No one on board liked the original wife and quite frankly she despised them all. Becca, however, fits in better than she ever did in what she had known as her time. It is very amusing how James doesn't understand the sudden changes in his wife. She never liked having sex with him, and didn't like him at all. Now, all of a sudden, Becca can't get enough smexy time with him, and vice versa. This is such a quick, fun and hot read!This was my favorite pirate story before I read any of Maureen O. Betita's The Kraken's Caribbean stories starting withThe Kraken's Mirror (The Kraken's Caribbean),The Chameleon Goggles (The Kraken's Caribbean)andThe Pirate Circus (The Kraken's Caribbean).In general I don't like time travel stories, but Ms. Jordan handled it well.

But if this puts you off read the next book with Morgan and Joe.  Each book is stand alone and can be read individually but you may want to read them in order so that you can see how all the characters relationship with each other and &#34;the crew&#34; develop into a working relationship.The love and &#34;family&#34; they all make is not the &#34;norm&#34; but you will see how they all love each other and if IOU let herself forget societies ideas go you will love the series.,positive,book

I want aliens, vampires, Lykae, Gods and Demons at this point. Half-beasts actually seem tamed compared to that :pNow that I have the back story, I'm dying to go and finish Maddox. He was KILLING me.

Sometimes it's hard to say no to those you love and Holly didn't know how to until Carson did it for her. I also loved the fact that Holly's sister called their whole family out for what they were all doing. It was a great scene that made me smile. I would love this to be a series so that I could learn more about the men in Carson's SEAL team. I want to know if his friend ends up with the psychic of his dreams or not, and to find out what happens with the other two who you don't hear a lot about.ADDITION: This is part of a series.

6093,"I read this because someone recommended it to me, and it was a cute read.  Other reviewers have already summed up the book, so I won't go into that.  I'd say the author's biggest strength is her humor.  I'll give an example.  The hero had the heroine in a bath (she wasn't feeling well at the time so he was trying to bring down her fever), and she asked, ""What am I doing here and why do I keep touching your lovely chest?"" It was the last part that had me laughing out loud.  Even as I think of it now, I'm laughing.This is a good book for people who like women disguised as men stories where the women are strong and fully capable of taking care of themselves.  The heroine was no wimpering female, and the hero was lovable too.One thing I don't understand is why this was tagged as a Christian romance.  If you're familiar with the traditional market for Christian romances, this is not tame enough to be termed Christian.  There's stuff in here that would be deemed offensive.  Though the hero and heroine never went all the way, they did go pretty far, and since Christian romances don't go beyond the kiss and some readers thinking necking is ""lustful"", I don't know if I'd recommend this book to women who are uncomfortable with nudity and touching body parts that are usually covered.  (For me, this is not a problem, but since I've seen some reviews by women who expected a very clean Christian romance and got upset with ""necking"", they won't like this book.  But if you like a little more realism in your book, then I say go for it!)Like I said, I have no problems with this book.  It was fun and light and perfect for a nice beach read.",positive,book

6150,"After reading the Out of the Box series I just HAD to learn what the story was with Brett, Leo and Lisa. They're appearance in those stories had piqued my interest.The club On The Edge was only 3 months old but it had been an instant success with the people of Haventown. Both human and vampire alike. It's success was so great that it's owner Brett had to hire more help. After a hard day of interviews he was ready for a quiet night at home. Instead he found himself in whole different, but much more pleasing situation.Though short I loved reading this. Number one, the whole idea of vampires and humans mingling and having fun on the dance floor and in the dark alcoves makes me shiver. It makes me want to put on my dancing shoes and a slinky dress! The second thing that made this a hit for me was how easy it was for me to slip into the story. Kallysten has a way of making a reader feel as if they're part of the story, not an outsider looking in.Kallysten's writing is smooth and extremely hot. She never fails to give her readers a fantastic tale that leaves them panting for more!",positive,book

6173,"After surviving at least 6 reads...It is still one of my favourite books but I will admit that there are a few clunky moments in it ... this is a fun, sweet, GFY romance but it doesn't survive overly-close scrutiny ... if you are in the mood for fluff with a bit of substance (i.e. Cappuccino fluff verses spun candy) then read this book & enjoy the story ... I do ... repeatedly ;-)Original review...I read this book for the third time today. I really enjoy this one. This story, although not perfect, is a very believable premise for gay-for-you love. You can just imagine the two MCs, Mav & Duke 'daring' each other so as to excuse their gay urges. Reminds me of all those spin-the-bottle games I played at school camps & sleep-overs as a child. There is a little bit of awkwardness to the angst, but apart from that the story hangs together well. The erotic content is beautifully written too. This is a sweet romance that I would happily recommend.",positive,book

6227,"There is more to Brittany than meets the eye and Charlie is going to be lucky enough to see it...if Brittany will let him.  Brittany has a past that holds her back from anything more than meaningless flings.  Charlie wants to see past Brittany's appearance but she's holding back.After winning the lottery Brittany and he two best friends hire Charles to help manage their winnings.  After going on a few shopping sprees, Brittany has decided to take a chance and do something good with her money.  Charlie is thrilled until she starts asking questions about his sex life.  After a hot meeting in his office, neither of them can stop thinking about the other.  Will Brittany be able to let go and let Charlie love her or will she walk away from what could be true love?This is the first in a three book series and I love it.  We get to meet Brittany and her two best friends after they won the lottery.  They have hired Charlie to help but soon Charlie and Brittany have a passionate interlude that leaves them both wanting more.  This story is hot, hot, hot!  Be warned (personally it's a good warning if you're like me) this is erotica and there is lots of hot, well described sex in this book.  But the most important thing is that there is romance and a good plot as well.  I love the switch between POV.  I always enjoy knowing what both characters are thinking.  There is a HEA here so you don't have to worry about that.  Lol  You might as well buy books two and three when you get this one because you are definitely going to want to read those immediately after finishing this one.",positive,book

6511,"The book, originally written just after the sinking of the Titanic, reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was published, especially with regard to the distinct roles of men and women. Obviously bereft of the insights derived from the discovery of the Titanic, it nevertheless raises two provocative issues: a fire in the coal bunker and unruly passengers being shot. However, I wish to clarify the matter of pictures which the mixing of reviews for two different editions has created.  The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted, but it DOES have photographs. The decision, therefore, is whether the inclusion of the photos is worth spending a dollar rather than getting the text for free. I think the photos, while not spectacular, greatly enhance the presentation and would therefore recommend the MacMay edition.",positive,book
6526,Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available.,positive,book

6762,"One thing that I have learned about Jodi Redford is to always expect the unexpected. You never quite know what she is going to come up with. The only thing that you can be sure of is that whatever surprises she has in store, they will be entertaining. Lover Enslaved was definitely no exception.It should be no surprise that the characters are what made this book so much fun. They were witty, fun, just the right amount of snarky and the supporting characters were just as much fun as Dash and Mara. Of course there were some serious moments too. Both of these characters had been through a lot and they both had their own share of secrets. During the course of this story they both discovered as much about themselves as they did about each other.The bad guys were despicable, the humor was as smart as it was funny, the characters had depth and there was just enough action to keep everyone happy. I also have to mention that I can't remember the last time I read a book by Jodi Redford that had quite this much *ahem* tension. By the end of the book I actually felt sorry for Dash. There's only so much torture a sex crazed Fae should have to endure.As usual, pay attention to the warning... it's for real and not an exaggeration. This author knows how to pull out all the stops and keep things interesting until the very last page.The next book in this series, Lover Enraptured, is sure to be just as much fun as this one. Can't wait until August 2013!",positive,book

6829,"Of all the Jules Verne ebook compilations containing 30+ titles currently available in the Kindle store, this Halcyon Press edition is pretty good. An active TOC pinpoints specific content. I am particularly happy to see a full and modern translation of ""20,000 Leagues"" by F.P.Walter (though he is not credited and his informative, introductory essay is not included). I'm also glad to see a true (""Professor Lidenbrock"") translation of ""Journey to the Interior of the Earth"" rather than the sadly all-too-common bogus (""Professor Hardwigg"") version often passed off as being by Verne. The other major works are translated reasonably well keeping in mind that these are older, public domain versions. I do, however, prefer a slightly different public domain version of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Dick Sand,"" but that's a mere quibble.I have two more quibbles. FIRST is that several times a graphic will not be included but the words ""graphic appears here"" will appear instead. SECOND is that italics are often represented by an underline before and after the emphasized word(s), __like this___, a confusing annoyance when the names of several ships (normally italicized) are being referred to. These are not deal-breakers but something you may wish to consider (and because of them I have subtracted one star). The formatting is otherwise okay.As to containing 36 works, the count is inflated a tad by counting the two parts of ""Captain Hatteras"" as separate entities and unnecessarily including (and counting) a duplicate portion of ""Mysterious Island.""  You really get 34 distinct tales (not 36)--but that is still a lot of Verne, though it is by no means complete. That honor goes to Delphi.Delphi has a truly complete set, though a dozen works (not yet cheaply available in public domain translations) appear in French for the sake of completeness. Since I am not fluent in that language, I do not fully appreciate their inclusion. I do, however, greatly appreciate the inclusion of about 20 (!) more titles--in English--than this Halcyon (or any other) set. This makes the Delphi edition the largest and most appealing to me (even though the aforementioned modern translation by F.P. Walter is not used in it).I would encourage you to search, sample, and compare because new Verne collections keep popping up all the time in the Kindle Store. Check to see which titles are included, if the main TOC is active and takes you to additional active TOCs (one for each book), and that the text is formatted to your liking. See if graphics and illustrations are included. The one you ultimately select will depend upon the level of your interest in, and the degree of your enthusiasm for, the writings of Jules Verne. If you want a substantial collection which includes the well-known great Verne classics, this Halcyon set (or a recent, $.99 one from e-artnow, which is worth examining) should be quite fine. But if you want even MORE (as in EVERYTHING), the very BEST is that all-inclusive Delphi set.",positive,book

I believe this would make a great movie, and I've even got the actor picked out!Other reviewers have described the plot so there is no need for me to go there.  The only reason I did not give this five stars is because of the numerous misspelled words, incomplete sentences, and other grammatical problems which were terribly distracting. After finishing the book I looked at the credits and saw this was originally published in 1995.  This obviously means the Kindle version was somehow translated from the printed version and these mistakes are hopefully not replicated in print.  The Kindle version is an atrocious one and badly needs to be revisited by somebody.",positive,book

6918,"4 and 1/2 stars! A DANCE IN THE DARK by Karen Ranney is captivating, somewhat sad, yet sweet in its ugly duckling theme. Louisa believes herself to be ugly, not just unattractive, but actually ugly. She hears the snickers when she enters a room, the horrible insults launched at her back as she passes by, and knows that no man truly wants her for anything more than her extensive dowry. When she encounters the dark stranger who lives in a cave, keeps to the shadows but whose soothing voice and demeanor intrigues, and attracts her, she soon learns that there is more to a person than what is reflected in the mirror, or in others' eyes. Douglas fears that trying to live in the world alongside those who are so different from him endangers all who cross his path. Soon he learns that whereas normal is a concept which all humans strive to obtain, no one is truly normal and he may be accepted for his differences more easily than he expects.This dark, sweet novella about love overcoming diversity and that beauty is in the eye of the beholder will keep you enthralled from the beginning moments, when Louisa discovers the cave home of Douglas to the reveal of his dark secret, a lovely dance in the moonlight, and their eventual happily-ever-after. I highly recommend reading A DANCE IN THE DARK by Karen Ranney for any number of reasons listed above, but mostly because it's just that good - in fact, I wish it had been longer.***Copy gifted as part of subscribing to author's newsletter.

6925,"Author Steve Peek has managed to straddle two worlds, bring his characters through the veils that separate them and still maintain a shroud of mystery around his tale, Longclaws. Are they from the realm we refer to as Hell? Are they behind the legends of the vampire? Are they going to cause me to sleep with the lights on for a while?Longclaws are predators with super-human strength, speed and bravery in their world, where survival is a constant battle. Each member of the clan has an important role to play, vital to their survival, yet, we do not meet them as individuals because that seems unimportant, they are what and who they are, able to see the big picture in the battle for survival, fiercely loyal to their clan and their traditions. When one Leader finds a way to cross the veils that surround their world from ours, it is to survive. Humans are unknown demons to them, weak, yet with the will to survive that is respected by the longclaws. If not for their passing through these veils or ley lines a young boy would never know how to belong to a family, how to feel loved, or how to find self-respect. I wondered if there was a villain in this tale. I saw factions fighting for survival in the only way they knew how!Steve Peek's writing style is almost dreamlike, blending Indian folklore, ley lines, myths and legends into a tale that will stay with you, in a hauntingly beautiful way. He grounds his tale with humanity at its finest, everyday people coping with the impossible, often mirroring the clan's will for survival, but who will win in the end?On a personal note, I absolutely loved the writing, the plot, the characters, the style, the pace and the world-building....my anticipated nightmares, not so much.",positive,book
6927,"Ok, so this book is relatively short, coming in around 9200 words, under 40 pages.  Right off the bat it starts with a sexy shower scene - my favorite!  I don't know what it is, but the water, the steam, the whole thing just sets me off.  Here we meet Brett and Lisa, human and vampire, respectively.  And as it turns out, they are in a relationship, eleven months so far.I felt like they were really great together.  They had a playfulness, and you could still see they cared for each other beyond that flirtation.  They respected each other for what they were, and so when Lisa went to the club downstairs to feed, Brett (and I) thought nothing of it.But here I'm going to break off from the characters for a minute to talk about On The Edge, the club.  This place is very much a character in the story, itself.  It's vampire and human friendly, a place for them to meet and mingle, and sometimes even more.  Drink blood, or ""dirty wine"", or anything else a mere mortal might enjoy.  It's a place with alcoves and overhead walkways, loud music, and great ambiance.In the club, Lisa runs into an old friend - Leo.  Right away their familiarity puts me on edge a bit.  Um, hello, what about Brett??  So when Lisa brings both of them back to the home that Brett and Lisa share, I can definitely understand - and agree with - Brett's apprehension.But that Lisa, she's a smarty.  And there comes a point in this story when I got very angry with her, I felt betrayed for Brett, and in a very bad way.  I called Lisa some very bad names.  But like I said, she's smart.  Don't underestimate that girl, and don't think her heart is in the wrong place.And Leo?  He turned out to be one of my favorites of the five I met through these two books.  I absolutely adore this man, and his lack of inhibitions. He's tall, dark, and handsome.  Sexy and mysterious.  Dangerous.  All of the above, and all things vampire.This story was m-m-f and m-f-m.  And it was so wonderful and beautiful, and unbearably hot.  I definitely recommend it, and I definitely recommend reading it first, before moving on any more in the On The Edge series.",positive,book

6953,"This fabulously written book drew me in.  Miranda's a little like the wife in the movie True Lies, she lives simply to take care of her husband the lightkeeper, and her two boys.  But she loves deeply, and she takes action when her husband disappears. She is naive and finds herself in a foreign world with the only resource of herself to rely upon.  She stumbles around not knowing what a morass she has placed herself into. Nothing is at it seems. She can't tell the good guys from the bad guys. This character development and plot is a study of subtlety. There is enough suspense and mystery to intrigue the reader to stick with Miranda. I love Miranda. I love devoted mothers and wives.  I really love that this author made the power of love be the guiding motivation for our heroine.  This is not an action genre book.  Which makes it all the more delicious.  This is a real life fantasy, sci-fi, magic story that you can't quite pin anywhere.  The writing is superb.  The reviewers who didn't like this book are probably needing 'in your face' stimulation that is fast and dramatic. This is a book to be savored and tasted. It's like engaging in high tea with Devon cream and croissants. You soak in the ambiance, smell the salt air, skirt the garbage and stay alert to being followed.  This is the most courageous of heroines because she diligently continues her search with her inadequate knowledge. She pieces together the mystery of her husband. She continues on in the face of complete unknowing - which is one of the greatest challenges we each face in our own world. She continues on even when everything she knows turns upside down. This book is a bestseller for a reason.  It is an amazing book.  I can not recommend it highly enough.",positive,book

And, beware, the end of the book is open, I was for once glad for the insight on the first chapter ofCamp Hell: A Psycop Novel.I loved the story. For once it's Jacob who's having difficulties in his case and Victor (with a distressed Lisa) come to the rescue. In the previous books Jacob was the one in control, but in this book the single-mindedness with which he pursues both the resolution of his case and Victor borders on possession. Victor for once seems to be able to assert himself, even the way he embraces his jealousy was a surprise for me.

Again, if Lincoln was fleshed out better, this his actions and reactions would have built more drama perhaps even better.As for the rest of the story and plot line, those are just perfect the way they are",positive,book

7404,"Werewolf Dylan Gerrano knows his place in the pack, and it is not at the top. After helping his friends Abby and Brynn escape their ruthless alpha, Alan Matthews, they found themselves at the sanctuary of Red Rock. Here they have a new, kinder alpha and a place where they can start to call home. Dylan lived under violent conditions for ten long years, and collected many internal scars. Dylan is not an alpha, but that doesn't mean he isn't deadly. In the previous book, Sanctuary Lost, he killed Alan Matthews, and does not have one bit of regret.New to the sanctuary is Sasha Wallace. Sasha is a witch, who Alan Matthews had, and she escaped after Dylan killed him. Sasha's experience with werewolves has been anything but pleasant, and it is taking her awhile to adjust to the volatile emotions wolves can throw off. On top of that, wolves don't trust witches, and the tension in town is quite high with lots of evil stares her way.When a wolf is found with vampire bites, the town is stumped as to how to help cure her. Dylan and Sasha are fond of research and take to the books to see if they can help come up with a cure. As they spend time together, an attraction starts to build. Sasha worries Dylan's attraction is based solely on his wolf wanting to protect and heal, but after a few steamy kisses, Sasha is convinced it may be the real thing building between them. When their alpha sends them on a road trip to talk to a vampire friend of the pack, Sasha and Dylan spend quality time together and their bond cements.Sanctuary's Price is the third book in Moira Roger's Red Rock Pass series and this time the testosterone is taken down a bit. The first two books present very alpha wolves, but Dylan is quite submissive. But don't let that fool you. One of my favorite things about werewolf paranormal books is the politics and hierarchy of a wolf pack. Dylan is lower because he is submissive, but at Red Rock that doesn't mean he isn't respected. And when it comes to protecting the one he loves, he can fight as well as any alpha. He may not be constantly sneering, and growling if someone looks at his female the wrong way, but he has the ""mine"" concept down quite well.Dylan and Sasha have a very sweet romance going on in this book and it made me smile to read about them. They are both such good natured people, that have had to overcome much in their life to find happiness. You root for these two to finally find each other and experience joy. For as mild mannered they be in public, they have sparks flying in the bedroom.The female I loved in this book more than Sasha is Brynn, who is the heroine from the second book. Brynn was changed into a wolf during the full moon in book two and her wolf is extremely close to the surface at all times. She can almost be considered feral and is such an interesting character to read about. She is totally out of control and I love that she has already had her book, but still has so much yet to go through. She didn't get a ton of page time or overpower the romance between Dylan and Sasha, but she is definitely intriguing.This is the fifth book overall that I have read by Moira Rogers and I have to tell you that I have yet to be disappointed. I love their style of writing - they are sarcastic, funny, the sex is always hot, the action is always violent and their continuation of the stories and world building really stands out. The next book in this series, Sanctuary Unbound is out June first, and features a character we meet briefly in this book - Adam, a flannel wearing lumberjack vampire, who is going to be very fun to read about.",positive,book

7420,"Ten years before Lucas was a young high school teacher just out of college; he was the classical teacher who liked to be more a friends than a authoritative figure for his students, but he did that without second thoughts. Problem was that one of his student was an unstable teen who probably would need a psychiatric help and instead his family didn't take with the right seriousness the problem. Riley, the student, approached Lucas and when the man refused him, all went to hell: Lucas was raped and left for dead in a burning cabin. He managed to survive and to denounce Riley, but he also lost his life and his lover, who couldn't suffer his scarred body.Now Lucas has a new life in a little small town where everyone loves him, above all the local sheriff; Nicholas is an handsome man, with plenty of choice if he wants, but he sets his eyes on Lucas. When they met five years before, Lucas was still too traumatized by his past events and he was not ready for something serious, and so Nicholas accepted the second choice to be his best friend. But now Riley is out of prison and both Lucas than Nicholas know that the man will come for Lucas, and Nicholas is not willing to let the man take the most important thing he has, Lucas; since Nicholas has no doubt that Lucas is his own.The story is not very long and there is not mystery, since it's clear since the beginning that Riley will try to harm Lucas once again. It's more interesting to read and see how Nicholas will convince Lucas to accept not only his help but also his love. Truth be told, I think that Nicholas takes advantage of the situation to force Lucas to accept something than in other condition it will be years before they arrive to the same point. Probably Nicholas is tired to wait (but not enough to renounce) and above all he is tired to be judge by someone else actions. And this is maybe the point that I understood less: it's true that Lucas is scarred, but only on his back; in his everyday life, with dress on, he is a very beautiful man, and no one can notice his scars. All right, being a gay man, maybe having is back all scarred is a bit more important than a straight man (naughty Elisa, I know), but is it enough of a reason to dump someone? Lucas is clever, handsome, with a good work, is it possible that someone dumped him for some scars? And even if it happened, is it possible that he chose 10 years of chastity upon the action of only one man?Anyway, the story is quite tender and the sex is good, something I noticed in the previous books by the same author: she mixes well the two elements, never letting the sex take the main role in the story, always letting the tenderness and love being in first line.",positive,book

7438,"I have enjoyed the entire Supernatural Bonds series so far and this is another great addition.I personally love it when the story's main character is a dragon, not only because I love dragons but because there are so few of these out there, in terms of the entire scope if paranormal writing.As per typical, we have an Alpha dragon seeking his mate.  I loved that this particular dragon was an oldie with specific ideas on how he was going to go about claiming his human mate, only to have it all go to pot once he found her.  Living through his frustration, all while seeing his extreme enjoyment, was quite amusing.In this book, I was a bit surprised that there wasn't a super baddie to be fought off, run from, protect against, as ie usually the way. After all, a good story has to have an antagonist/adversary right?  Without giving away key aspects of the story, I will simply say that in this story, the threat was not against his mate but rather someone she cared about.  Even with that, I have to say the threat was not much & I was left somewhat disappointed in how that part of the story was handled. To me that's part of the story I usually enjoy, so having it lacking left me feeling kind of uh.For the most part I consider this a good addition to the series.  It is certainly not my favorite of the series thus far, and was more sex and ""me dragon, you mine,"" than it was an actual completely written story, but it was enjoyable.Given that the books are all character continuation (the same characters connect throughout the series in one way or another), I would recommend starting at the first book in the series.  This certainly can be read as stand-alone, but I think the entire concept will be much more thoroughly enjoyed (some of the characters, their abilities, their mates familiar) if read in reading order.I have already started the next in the series, ""Conner's Wolf,"" and I am hopeful that Jory will get back on track with a great villain, good plot and engaging story as she has thus far with the Supernatural Bonds Series.  Enjoy! :)",positive,book
7454,"First of all let's look at what makes USA Today readable in its print version:It is concise,well written and tries to cover all the major international,national and domestic news stories in an easy to read, user friendly format. It may not offer the intellectual brooding of papers like the NY Times but it also does not trivialize news like the New York tabloids.The USA Today just gives us the basics.In this regard it is ideally suited for the Kindle since the paper's format makes it easy to catalog and present news in its simplest form.The only reasons it gets 4 stars:1. The price needs to be lower since it is not published on weekends.2.

7458,"Kill The Storyis a very good mystery. Plot was highly original and will appeal especially to those who disapprove of the invasiveness of reporters (though the revenge in this case is harsher than deserved). Pacing was good, and kept me reading. Progress of the investigation was credible. Characters were interesting and intelligent. Ending is a nail-biter and highly satisfying.Two negatives in my opinion: some gratuitous cursing; also I've read mysteries that are slightly more uniformly gripping, though I'd put this one in the top quartile for ""grippingness"".Very entertaining.

Can Ross convince Julia it's more than just research?  Will their friendship survive?Erotic Research is a wonderful debut novel by Mari Carr.  The emotion and passion of this story is brilliant.

Julia broke my heart with her struggles in love and Ross is just the man to help her take a chance on it.Erotic Research is a story of tingling goodness!

She'd once put off her own desires and put a man's needs ahead of her own but she learned her lesson and isn't about to ever let another man dictate the course of her life.  However, she fully admits that she enjoys having a man in her bed and it's been too long since she's indulged in some down and dirty sexcapades.School's out for winter break and Caitlin's determined to have a good time before returning to her normal life of responsibility and control.  The last thing she expects is to run into a blast from the past called Eamon Blake, an Irishman with whom she'd shared a hot summer fling while staying in Ireland working at his family's pub.  They'd been great friends with benefits back then and Caitlin has no qualms about reawakening that side of their relationship.Eamon made the move from Ireland to establish a photography business in Las Angeles after the death of his father.  He's in Seattle where he has a few shoots to do for clients but running into Caitlin is a huge unexpected bonus.  He'd had a great time with Caitlin in Ireland and he's more than interested in reestablishing the sexual side of their relationship.  What he doesn't expect is the sudden desire for their relationship to be more than casual despite the fact that he isn't ready to settle down.Eamon's only going to be in Seattle for a week so they agree to enjoy the time they're together and part as friends.  Only neither of them is able to let go and via phone calls and occasional visits they continue their affair long distance.  At some point the long distance affair isn't going to cut it any longer.  Will their relationship survive an ultimatum or will they both find themselves alone and heartbroken over what may have been?Lauren Dane books have become a staple in my reading library.  Her stories are character driven, emotional, and always a lot of fun to immerse yourself in for a few hours.  ALWAYS tells the story of a couple who is perfect together yet they live twelve hundred miles apart and the time they spend apart is wearing on both of them.  I was able to empathize with both Eamon and Caitlin's points of view and my heart broke for each of them.Long distance relationships are extremely difficult to manage but I love how Eamon and Caitlin seem to handle the situation so effortlessly.  The secondary characters add a fun characteristic to the story with their interference in Eamon and Caitlin's relationship. Eamon's sister-in-law is especially delightful since she seems to especially enjoy antagonizing Eamon.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book

7731,"What a great novella and prequel into the new Guild Hunter series.  This is my first time reading anything from Nalini Singh and I really enjoyed this story.  The world that Nalini has built is both innovative and exciting.  Hunters (humans) are employed by the Guild who are essentially angels, to hunt down vampires that go against their contract w/ the angels.  Vampires are ""almost-immortals"" and are sired and indentured by the angels.  Angels are not the angels from the fairy tales of sugar and spice, these angels are cruel and twisted and thrive on the pain of others.  In this novella we follow a hunter named Ashwini who is hired by the powerful angel Nazarach.  Her assignment is to travel down to Atlanta and hunt down a vampire who has been kidnapped by a rival.  To succeed in her mission Ashwini persuades a vampire (Janvier), who has escaped being terminated by her on more than one occasion, to accompany her.  Ashwini and Janvier have great chemistry and seem to make a great team.  There is a lot of sexually charged tension between them.  There is quite a bit of action and suspense packed into this novella.  I look forward to the first book in the series Angel's Blood, due out 3/3/09.I also recommend:Bloodring: A Rogue Mage NovelSuccubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid, Book 3)The Touch of Twilight (Sign of the Zodiac, Book 3)Hotter Than Hell (Hell on Earth, Book 3)In the BloodThe Iron Hunt",positive,book

The repetition was minimal and there were issues outside of the couple instead of things that could have been fixed with one or two sentences.Which made THE ACCIDENTAL COUNTESS a very nice read.Stephen has been gone, with no word, for months. He set off to find Emily's brother. Daniel has been returned to Emily, dead.

8571,"I loved this book and had a hard job putting it down. Quinton is world weary. He works for a company that assesses the environmental impact of logging operations, but life and tragedy long ago caused him to set aside his idealistic, green principles. Regina is married to the boss of the logging operation, a man who pretty much owns the town of Crow's Landing and doesn't care who he tramples in his pursuit of success and financial gain. Throw in Regina's troubled teen, Michael, and Quinton's part Native American heritage and the conflicts start to pile up, especially when Regina and Quinton meet and the spark between them cannot be denied. These two troubled souls can't ignore their attraction for each other, despite the risks. Their budding relationship renews their enthusiasm for life and gives them both hope that happiness is possible again. But the tensions in Crow's Landing reach snapping point and when the logging mill burns down, somebody has to pay. The plot is complex and fast paced, and kept me up late turning the pages to find out what happened. There are some great secondary characters, especially  Hurricane and Fury, the two dogs.

There's no real depth to the characters but hey, it's a comedy, they don't have to be deep to be funny.The book could use another proofreading pass, but if you can get past the spelling, grammar, etc., then it's worth some time.

The secondary characters are interesting and I see a lot of potential for subsequent books.Hot romance, who am I kidding, hot sex!  It was well done and not just gratuitous.  Well, the scene in the club may have been gratuitous but I still liked it.There has to be a little danger in every romance book or it's just erotica.

8986,"This is a book that can be read on many levels.  It is fun, humorous, and filled with a bit of magic.  Yet it develops the theme of overcoming old wounds which is one I particularly love to read.  I picked it up after reading and liking another book of hers, His Majesty Prince of Toads.The fun premise is a magical brew (a love potion)that is causing all the bachelor's to marry. The Earl of Vailmont doesn't believe the rumors, however, and is determined to prove his theory that there is no magic involved. In typical rouge fashion, he sets out to show his friends that he can associate with women without getting caught. Unfortunately, he chooses Sylvia to experiment with and becomes attracted to her. This pits Val against Sylvia in a game of pursuit as old as time.You can read this for the fun, surface story of magical love potions, lusty protagonists, and fears of marriage and really enjoy this book. You can also read this for the underlying story where both Val and Sylvia have suffered  great losses--loss that has always stood in the way of true happiness and finding love. Though they each approach their losses--betrayal, moral dilemmas, death, in different ways it is that approach and that desire to find love that is for me the real conflict in this story and what puts it above many others in this genre.",positive,book

I was very interested in the story and how it would turn out (hoped for the best), and if she had another book focusing on the nature of the hero I'd buy that one as well, as I found it an interesting twist on the archetype, but I think from her booklist most her stuff is the more classical romance novel.

It is also more of a romance than either of her other series.Meli has retired from her work as an energy wielding assassin.  Then her Family asks one more thing of her...to assassinate the man that ruined her life.  The story is set in a futuristic world where Mafia-like families maintain order and humans have been biological engineered to be exceptional.This isn't a long book, it's a novella.  Despite this fact Andrews does an excellent job creating a believable world and engaging characters.  She give the characters wonderful history and wonderful chemistry.  The writing, as usual, is incredibly engaging and a joy to read.There is some action in this book, but it is mostly a story of two characters at odds with their worlds.  The romance aspect is much stronger in this story than in other books from Andrews, and the sex scenes much more explicit.  I am not huge on romance and prefer action, but I really enjoyed reading this book.  I fell in love with the characters and was on the edge of my set just hoping for a happy ending.The story ends well too.  This is a very interested world and I hope we get to see more stories set here.Pick this up if you get a chance, it is well worth the $2.00 it costs on Amazon.

9663,"Stacy Daniels's father has been dead to her for years but now that he's finally passed away in reality she has some very difficult decisions to make.  She's been living and working in Great Falls but her father's ranch is where her heart truly lies.  There's just the little issue of her love for Wolfe, Cash and Travis and how wrong loving them seems.Brothers Wolfe, Cash and Travis have been in love with Stacy for years.  They've done their best to protect her from her father's bullying and hateful attitude.  They've never expressed their feelings to Stacy and now with her father gone they feel it's time for her to come back to the ranch - where she belongs - as their woman.Stacy's guilt over the perceived wrong on being in love with three men is emotionally agonizing.  She's convinced her only option is to sell the beloved ranch and return to Great Falls as soon as possible.  Only first she has to consult the attorney about the property and for some reason the man is never available.  That means she spends a lot of time around the ranch and avoiding Wolfe, Cash and Travis is impossible especially when each of them keeps such a close eye on her.  When each man individually seduces her she becomes even more confused and scared.  Despite the men's insistence that she is home, she's determined to leave and doesn't believe there's any way she can confide in them about her feelings for them all.  As it is she's afraid they're going to find out that's she's cheated on each of them with their own brother.  Only there are things that Stacy doesn't know which will shock and change everything she's ever believed.  Will she stay after learning the truth about the ranch and what her father did?HER DAKOTA MEN takes readers on an emotional journey along with the characters as each comes to grips with their feelings and what they mean for their future.  Stacy's generous nature and love for the ranch and everyone who resides there really touches your heart even as you wonder how she could be such a sweet person when her father was so mentally abusive.  Wolfe, Cash and Travis are wonderful men who want nothing more than Stacy's happiness - and for her to stay at the ranch.  They're all dominant men by nature and their interactions with Stacy are beyond scorching.

9710,"The Remnants: Stories of the Jewish Resistance.By Othneil J. SeidenI loved this book! I wasn't sure what to expect when I got it, but upon reading the forward I was prepared for a wonderful historical novel. What I got was even better! I got a novel that was so based in fact and true stories that almost every encounter, every event, could be looked up and backed by historical fact. I did.I love a book that takes me so deep in the history of an event and makes it all so real that it sends me into research mode to verify things and learn more. This book did this in spades. What should have been a day or two read, turned into almost a week because I had to keep stopping and looking things up; I have over two pages of notes on events and people and rumors that I had to chase down. And Mr. Seiden never disappointed me, every part was true, from the Trench at Babi Yar, to the constant gun fire going on there by the Nazi's once they invaded Kiev. The fact that Soviet held countries, the Jews in particular, welcomed the German's as liberators from the prejudice, suppressive Communist party, only to find themselves in worse shape than they were before. The small bands of resistance fighters, turning into larger bands, the woods of Russia and the Russian weather providing the native fighters hiding places and advantages over the better equip German army. The pain of the bands too far away to heed the calls from the Warsaw Ghetto when they had their uprising Passover of 1943, and with each call they knew that no one was going to help them, not the closer resistance groups, not the allies, no one went the aid of these people that fought for over a month with no back up.The mob mentality of the people, turning on their neighbor's wasn't a surprise to me, having learned all this from a historical view point growing up more than 40 years after the fact, but in this author's writing I can see that it wasn't a surprise to him either, or his characters he writes about, having been pushed to the background, into slums, ignored by their government and spit up on by their peers over time, they expected it. The Pogrom's that the Church organized and the Government looked the other way during which they went in and massacred as many Jews as they could for centuries. What surprised them was the way the supposedly civilized German people treated them. The dislike and distrust of the Vatican and the Catholics in general, the people of the time had came through loud and clear in this work, but what came through also was the belief that people could go against what they had been taught all their life. By accepting some Genitals into their group, and trusting the fledgling groups location and plans to the couple that saved Solomon, and the Priest that spoke against the killings, and later sent Jews to them, and eventually joined them; yes, Mr. Seiden was able see all sides of the fallible humans that got caught in Hitler's quest for power and world domination.I give this book a rating of five solid stars, and am recommending it to any of my friends that have any type of interest in this area of history. Thank you for writing this book, and for giving me something new to learn about a time I thought I had pretty much exhausted all avenues on. I loved every part of this book, every death cut me, but I know it was war and it wasn't going to be pretty going into it. There wouldn't be roses and birds singing all through the story line, but they were there when it was most unexpected. A great tale very carefully and thoroughly researched and plotted out.

9734,"From the title, I visualized a quasi-medieval fantasy of four brothers, like knights, riding forth to engage the enemy.  The Order, instead, is an organization of many men and women of various talents and expertise whose teams, aided by the gods, fight to contain The Thing that brought evil to the world.Some readers don't like prologues, but I was immediately caught up and found the book hard to put down.  The prologue tells how evil appeared and gave rise to the Starry Wisdom, worshippers of this evil.  Priests founded the Order of the Four Sons to fight the Starry Wisdom.The adventure begins in a shroud of mystery that grips the reader, like a Dan Brown religious thriller.  Someone cries out for help.In the softness of time we see the evil's effects, down to the present.  Children disappear and so do teams of the Order of the Four Sons.  As the crisis grows, we get a lot of names thrown at us, but most of these resolve into unique characters with memorable personalities--a retired marine, a burnt out ex detective, an old man, two technology geeks, and a trainee of unknown but surprising talents.  Garnette, Murphy, Doug, Cecil, Bill, and Kate comprise the last team to be formed, incomplete and ill prepared.  And we love them, for the writers manage them like a master.  Without delving into character backgrounds, we quickly sense that they are solidly human.  And we delight in their witty exchanges, a gallows humor that helps them maintain a mental balance throughout the demonic warfare.They battle Lady Bathory, more monster than lady, and her cohorts, who seek a magic wand that will stabilize a gate between worlds so she can expand her territory.  The team of the Order must find the wand first.  The quest becomes a spiritual treasure hunt as one clue leads to another.Much of the writing is impeccable, but questions arise, not all of which are answered to the reader's satisfaction.  Sure, I can figure out some.  But I suspect that some answers won't be forthcoming in Book Two.  For example, a federal organization called MJ-12 gets involved, and I'm wondering, Who are these guys?  Why are they attacking the team?  Also, more names than necessary are mentioned.  The characters have more than one name; some have several.  Ordinarily this caused the reader no problem, but I suffered some confusion, particularly over who the Blood Lady is and belatedly realized she is imprisoned in a bubble.The story ends in a cliff hanger.  Questions dangle.  We can expect answers to most in Book Two of the series.  But not all--and that's what bothers me.  In essence the Oracle tells us to stay tuned for the further adventures of our team.  The read is entertaining, so grab your next copy.",positive,book

Six years later Gregory finally makes Ryland his only to learn that he may lose him. To Gregory Ryland has always been special but he discovers what sets Ryland apart from the other wolves in their pack may be the very same thing that kills him. Ryland is a Tri-Omega and has to have two mates to keep him balanced and safe and he has to be claimed by both mates daily or he will die.

I love this series it as some very hot sex scenes I mean three hot guys sexing is oh so hot.

Alex is the first Faustian to be fated with a wife . . . the only thing is she lives in Colorado and will take a little convincing (of Alex's love for her, their bond and the truth about vampires).It's true; there are some bad vampire love stories out there. But Evie Byrne's first book in the `Faustin Brothers' trilogy isn't one of them. To be honest, `Called by Blood' isn't reinventing the fang - there's a mortal love interest, a rich and powerful vampiric family and a lot of smexing going on. But Byrne's series is oddly delightful, regardless of the well-trod territory.One of the great things about this book is Byrne's tongue-in-cheek humour. Alex Faustin lives in modern-day New York and his `mate' is Helena, a modern woman. These people know about vampires - the movies, myths and romantic ridiculousness - and as a result, Byrne draws on many references and pokes fun at many a legend. I liked her vampiric brevity - it was refreshing, without denouncing all the typical vampire/mortal problems.This novel is very sexy, first and foremost. It's from Samhain Publishing - a notoriously hot publisher. But `Called by Blood' has a surprisingly veering plot; when the rich and handsome Alex is burnt by the sun and spends a portion of the book resembling Freddy Krueger. That's right, a vampire love story in which the smoking-hot dead dude looks nasty and blistered for much of the book. It means that Alex and Helena have to connect on a personal level before a physical one . . . but when they do get physical, Byrne brings the goods (while still keeping things light and funny).My one small complaint about the book was the abrupt ending - I really would have liked another 100 pages or so. Since this is the `Faustin Brothers' trilogy it would have been nice to meet all of the Faustin brothers and get a sense of the family dynamic (as it is, we only meet oldest brother, Mikhail). And with an extra 100 pages we may have been able to read about Helena assimilating to vampirism and New York. But that's a small and complimentary complaint about wanting more, more, more from Evie Byrne's wonderful novel!",positive,book
10082,"Blurb excerpt: Nothing's sexier than a man, or five, with power tools...Well, yes I have to agree.  Ask any woman and I'm sure she'd admit to having a fantasy or two about those hunky guys on the home improvement channels.  But let's get back to the story.Imagine if you will a young, single, good looking girl living alone and renovating a house willed to her by her last living relative that had past away recently.  What happened to her parents?  Why is she alone?  Why does she have to be totally mouse-ish and shy?  Why is she doing the renovations herself?  Is she short on money after paying hospital bills? What does she do for a living?  Did she get laid off?  Where's she getting the money for the renovations? One day five guys move into the house next door, who just so happen to be young and good looking themselves, with the intention to flip the house for a profit.  Everyone gets neighborly, guys give her tips on this and that, let her borrow tools, help her with projects,  etc.  Is the house in that much of disrepair or is this her excuse for spending more time with these men?  Sexual tension increases between them all in various ways but more so to the leader of the group, although no one acts upon it.  She often catches herself fantasyzing about the men...even though she's mouse-ish and shy.  Then one day...BAM!  This is the start of this story.  Only, there is only a passing mention of a relative leaving her the house.  No real back story.  So if you expect to get a plot out of this don't bother. (Or you could go with what I just supplied you)  But, plot smot!  The sex rocks.  Push the I believe button and just enjoy the smex, hot menage SMEX!!!  And of course it's got a HEA (happily ever after).  It's only about two sentences long, BUT WHO CARES, RIGHT?",positive,book

10187,"J. L. Langley created a wonderful world of werewolves and mates and love and romance, and With Love is a fun tale indeed.Devlin is visiting another town, looking for a place for he and his business partner to move their construction company to. He's sizing up the local werewolf pack, introducing himself so he can scope out the feasibility of moving here. What he finds is a ruthless pack Alpha who is abusing his Omega, a werewolf named Laine, and terrorizing the rest of the pack. One thing about werewolves.... they recognize their mate instantly, that special person that Fate has chosen for him, and the omega Laine is Devlin's mate. He quickly claims Laine as his, and now must work to dispatch the Alpha and remove him from his post so the town can be in peace again and he and his Laine can live happily ever after.The erotic nature is wonderfully sexy, it's romantic, it's funny, it's witty, and it's all-around good fun. The pace is swift, though the danger presented within the pages seems to be dispelled too easily to make for any real suspense. Still, it's a totally fun and engrossing story.I heartily recommend it, and especially recommend ""Without Reservations"" and ""With Caution"" (in that order), two more stories set in the same universe (the characters in this book have been mentioned in Without Reservations). While I enjoy the other two books more, this is still a wonderful and entertaining tale.",positive,book

Once that happens, this story moves at a relentless pace. We are drawn into a world of angry spirits that are controlled by a demon like no other.This book will keep you up late turning pages.

10406,"M/M/F (2 bisexual males/1 straight female) usually doesn't work well for me for a multitude of reasons, and the love scenes usually make me roll my eyes. They tend to be purple and overdone. Not so in this book! The sex in this book curled my toes. I had to actually catch my breath after the first scene between Cassie and Kyle. Whew. And the heat never lets up! Every encounter in this book is a scorcher.The menage situation in this book is surprisingly believable. Cassie's attraction to both of her best friends and her heartbreak at discovering them together is sweet and realistic. Her reasons for leaving town make perfect sense. Even Kyle and Alan's reason for looking to each other for affection works pretty well. The story isn't perfect, but I found it much more believable than most M/M/F I've encountered.This book was on track to be an A+ read--and then the author pulled out the oldest menage clich&eacute; in the book. No spoilers here, but it's one of those ""love it or hate it"" issues and I'm in the latter camp.If I were to ever read this again, I'd stop after the last big love scene and skip the ending.

10728,"Review by Lori: I picked this book to read because of it's cover. I know I know, never judge a book by it's cover, but the cover really grabbed my attention and pulled me in. So, even though this is a short read, it's really packed with a punch. Caitlyn and Sean are married, she wants to divorce him, he doesn't want his marriage to end. Sean is a cop who's got some bad guy after him and possibly anyone else close to him, so Sean needs to protect his wife much to her chagrin. Sean likes being in control and Caitlyn feels as if he doesn't listen to her which has caused some friction in their marriage. I liked this book. I really liked the idea of the story and the cover kind of hinted at some of the chemistry between the two characters and you shant be dissapointed!! What I had a problem with was because it was a short story, not all of the ideas that the author had could be developed fully. I would have liked to have witnessed the fight that led to their breakup. I wanted to see what their lives were like after she left. I liked the characters, they both were flawed and they loved each other in spite of them. I liked that they hurt each other and their marriage was messy but in the end they loved each other.

It's a task that should please her - Celino all but ruined her life more than a decade before.

When the opportunity for revenge arises, will Meli be able to bring herself to take it?Intrigue, danger, and romance mix together in this seductive game of cat and mouse.  Silent Blade is both exciting and fascinating, with two protagonists that would be the perfect match for one another, were it not for old wounds and new obstacles barring their path to happiness.Meli is a wonderful heroine.  She's brilliant and deadly, but her strength is balanced evenly with her femininity.  I admired her for this and truly felt for her when I read about how Celino's actions devastated her in the past.  As for her target, Celino is deadly both in business and with a blade.  His razor-sharp mind makes him a fitting opponent for Meli, but his ruthlessness is belied by his desire for her.

I think the things that turned off other readers was that the type of erotica in this book was unexpected.  Threesomes are more often in her writing than a monogamist relationship.  You have to have an open mind to truly get everything you can from her work.  I think with this novel you also need a healthy dose of imagination.

10954,Once again Diana Bold has written an enjoyable story full of rich complex characters. You can't help but root for the hoydonish American and her straight-laced British hero. I enjoy how all of her stories have a different approach to romance. She writes with the same intriguing tone and yet none of them mimic the other except in her broad range of storytelling.Emma has come to London with one purpose in mind--use her over generous dowry to win a titled husband. She is determined to fulfill her mother's dying wish to show the American society who shunned her that she could land a peer. She is equally determined to find a man for herself. A man she could love. Michael is in need of an heiress. But will he be able to handle this fire-branded American? Will he be strong enough to let go of his British reserve for the love he has always longed for?I fell in love with her secondary characters as well.

Altogether it was another solid story by Diana and I will look eagerly for the next in this series.,positive,book
10970,"My only issue with this short is the fact that he is her ""patient"", the thought that a mental health professional gives into lust with her patient makes my stomach queasy.  Once I put that portion out of my mind, I could appreciate the erotic scenes.Ross inherited certain alien genes from an experiment between human and Laetez scientists performed on his father.  While the experiment enhanced his father, they caused hyper aggression and strength in Ross, which led him to a violent life of crime.  Thyme is a counselor at Bane prison which houses only prisoners like Ross, maladjusted offspring of the original experiment subjects.  Luckily with counseling and some drug therapy Ross has learned to control his behavior and is now being released.  As part of his release he has taken a job as a manager of a space station, where he will live alone for 3 years.  Meanwhile Thyme who had developed feelings for Ross, decided to try and meet Ross in the real world.  Since he has never seen her face or even heard her real voice during the counseling sessions she has to be inventive as to how they can meet on a one man station.  Then starts the passion.As stated in the beginning I have an issue with a doctor/patient relationship, especially one that has lasted for more than 4 years.  However, when I ignored that issue, I found the story to be well written.  The story line was plausible (in a sci fi setting) and the sex scenes produced that lovely little zing.  Even though this is mainly a piece of erotica it also contained an interesting universe and several non sex related scenes which were written quite well and helped develop the relationship between Ross and Thyme.If you like erotica, I can recommend this story.

Similar to book 1 in that this is a FAST read. Given that, it is pretty satisfying. Good book to read in an afternoon if you just want a little relaxing fun. It would almost be as comforting as a good cup of tea... or is it the other way around?Characters are sweet- more sweet than sexy in this case. Both Missy and Tad come across as people you'd like to have living next door. Despite the fact that I wasn't drooling over them or caught up in their passion, their romance was well done. There was some background between the two which helped provide some depth and their sexual tension was fun to watch unfold. I chuckled in places and sighed in contentment in others.This series does seem a little light on the paranormal side- you don't really get to spend too much time on the shifting or their nature as wolves, but pack politics come into play- and certainly wolf instincts. This book had a bit more magic in it given that the Omega wolf was a key part of the plot.All in all, it's a light, uncomplicated paranormal romance series. Something to read for fun when you have time. It is light and romantic enough to be soothing. I will save the next one for a day when I need a little escape.FURTHER READING: if you like this, you'll like...Moira Rogers' basic werewolf romance series:Cry Sanctuary: Book 1 of Red Rock Pass seriesR.G.

11068,"Despite her pronounced limp, Professor Briony Swift is extremely good at her job so she's stunned when two of her A students hand her drop class requests.  She can't deny that seeing Nic and Leo in class every day has been a pleasure.  They're certainly the stars of many of her more erotic fantasies but they're students and therefore off limits.Nic Potter and Leo Phelps only enrolled in Briony's class so that they could get closer to her.  Neither of them needs the credit for her class in order to graduate and they feel it's time to make their true intentions toward Briony known.  They've seen her watching them and are aware that her desire for them is as strong as theirs is for her but there are ethics involved and convincing her to give them a chance is going to be more complicated than they initially thought.Nic and Leo's feelings for Briony go beyond sexual desire.  They honestly want to build a future with her.  However, their initial approach and suggestion that they have dinner together doesn't go over so well - especially once Nic blurts out the full extent of their sexual plans for her.  Briony's intelligent enough to know that the classroom is her safe haven and any non-academic involvement with Nic and Leo will be frowned upon.  That doesn't stop her from fanaticizing about them though.  Be that as it may, it's only a matter of time before she caves in to her own desires and takes Nic and Leo to her bed.  Just when it looks like they could possibly have a future together disaster strikes and their secret rendezvous are discovered.  Faced with the choice of career or her men Briony has some heavy decisions to make.Brynn Paulin's TWO PLUS ONE dives headfirst into the quandary of ethics versus desire.  Briony's a wonderful teacher who has always toed the line when it comes to her career.  Nic and Leo initially appear to be nothing more than college students hell bent on bedding the teacher but as you'll discover there's much more to them than meets the eye.  What I love about this story is watching Briony grow from a jittery unsure woman to one who stands up for herself and what she believes to be right.  Her disability and her career has been a crutch for her for so long that she's lost sight of what could truly make her happy so it brought a smile to my face to imagine Nic and Leo's determination to make her see herself the way they see her.  TWO PLUS ONE is one hot story full of steamy sex, raw sensuality and lots of little surprises as this trio works toward finding a way to build a future together.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",positive,book

I do like how their feelings never changed even though she is more cautious because of how he left and never got in touch. I do think he was faithful to her based on how he says his personal life suffered majorly because he was a workaholic and how every moment that he had away from work was filled with thinking of her. She was faithful to him because she had a son and never dated. I like when the hero and heroine only wants the other especially in this book because they both knew they had a once in a lifetime spark with the other. It was cute and fun and I was happy that he took the blame for them being apart and did not try to give blame to her for keeping his son from him like so many other heroes do even if the heroine did not know his real name.,positive,book

11140,"Unable to believe the number of business trips his brother-in-law Keith O'Connell makes to Dundee, Idaho, Isaac Russell decides to serendipitously follow him.  Isaac is stunned to find that Keith has another wife with three young daughters besides his sibling Liz.Forced to make a decision, Keith chooses his Idaho family for the sake of his offspring.  When his despondent sister Liz decides to follow her ""husband"" to Idaho, Isaac does likewise to insure she does not break the law by doing something stupid or even try to do something stupider like getting her ""husband"" to come back to her.  Complicating matters at least in Isaac's mind is his attraction to Keith's schoolteacher first wife Reenie Holbrook, who uses her maiden name.Big girls do cry when they suffer broken hearts as both women do when the truth about Keith's bigamy surfaces.  However, Reenie recovers faster perhaps because she has the kids to take care of (no time for breakdowns) and the interest of Isaac to help her move on while Liz feels abandoned and betrayed first by her two-timing spouse and then her brother.  She and the kids provide the fresh extended look at the impact of bigamy.Harriet Klausner",positive,book

11247,"What an awesome story! The characters really drive the plot forward and the author does a great job building their personalities while engaging your attention. Alex was a great heroine, gentle and sweet yet smart enough and strong enough to be capable of fulfilling her legacy. Joshua also was a powerful hero, torn between his duty to his pack and his increasing attraction to Alex. Intense sexual tension builds throughout the story. The complexity of the werewolf and their pack laws are very evident in how this story plays out and you will be amazed at how strong and loyal Joshua can be to himself as well as Alex and his pack. Alex's dad was a memorable secondary character and the book also featured several other people that had an impact on Alex and Joshua.

11325,"This story features a slow simmering burn that starts in Tess and Joe's hearts until it eventually consumes their entire being. This is not the type of love story that would traditionally interest me but the notion of an Englishman falling in love with his housesitter piqued my interest. I'm very thankful that it did. While this type of story may not be something I would normally read, Secrets is definitely a book that I would read again.Tess and Joe seem to have much similarity, yet many differences as well. Both seem to have a stubborn streak in them, and a quick wit that makes their banter truly entertaining. They both harbor secrets they are not willing to relinquish while still seeking to learn what the other is hiding. Tess has a stronger inner strength within this story than Joe does. She is willing to throw caution to the wind and see where it takes her. It is one of the reasons she took the housesitting job in the beginning. Joe however, seems to be a little more reluctant to change, and clearly has demons in his past that continue to taunt him.The love story between Tess and Joe is not the immediate mind numbing attraction that many love stories have. I actually appreciated this different type of growth and it made this story stand out from many others I have read. I like that Tess and Joe start off as acquaintances who eventually grows into a friends that graduate to becominging lovers. While this may sound like it may be a little too slow or drawn out it actually read very well and keep me interested and wanting to find out more. Even after I completed the book, I remembered the characters' names, which with the amount of books I read is a feat within itself.This is a story that I would recommend to anyone who loves a good love story whether it be a traditional romance or a more contemporary one. I think that all fans of romance could really curl up on the couch or in the bed and loose themselves for hours while learning Tess and Joe's secrets.Originally posted at the Long and Short Romance Reviews.",positive,book
11367,"Before reading 65 proof, I had read other works from this author. Those titles include The List, Origin, Whiskey Sour, Bloody Mary and Disturb. So its fair to say that he's a safe bet and keeps the hits rolling.In reality, some of these stories are sold as stand-alone ebooks. But you&#8217;re really getting  10 eBooks for the price of one. If that isn&#8217;t more bang for your buck, I don&#8217;t know what is.But I&#8217;d have to say that 65 proof is not only a good introduction to this author, but you&#8217;re also getting many genres across the board and you&#8217;re saving money by buying this book.This massive ebook collection is separated into 4 parts: Jack and Friends (any stories related to his mystery thriller series starring heroine, Jacqueline Daniels), Crime stories, Horror stories and Funny stuff.You&#8217;re led through these stories, and through his publishing career, as the author himself gives a brief intro to each story. Once you become familiar with his wit, it turns into a major selling point for each story. I&#8217;d sometimes laugh as he jokes in between them as he sets up the next tale. He&#8217;s also really good with Flash Fiction (stories in 500 words or less).Right off the bat, we&#8217;re treated with some clever Locked Room mysteries which I wasn&#8217;t a fan of before reading this book. But he came up with some really clever stuff. My favorite stories had to be the ones with Phineas Troutt, a hard-boiled dying man who generally doesn&#8217;t care about ruffling feathers or dishing out some old-fashioned justice. He has a gritty attitude that draws you in.The crime stories were equally hard-boiled as well as equally unpredictable. The Agreement story was especially chilling.The Horror section was good. One story stands out the most and that is The Screaming. It&#8217;s the most original concept for a vampire story I have read yet. It was also written a different way. I liked the style of it.Another good one is Symbios. This Sci-fi horror kind of reminded me of Stephen King&#8217;s Survivor Type story but with a compelling stranded on an alien planet angle.All told, I haven&#8217;t finished every single story. I&#8217;m 90% finished with it. But I know that it is a majorly meaty collection of stories which will intrigue you, wow you, shock you, drop you, sock you and keep you reading all night.There&#8217;s something for everyone.",positive,book

11423,"I honestly haven't loved every single book I have read, but Kallysten delivers another 5 for me.  I think the one thing that stood out to me the most was the relationship between Marc and Blake.  The Sire/Childe bond is so very strong, but even it can be blurred.  Marc and Blake end up helping Kate, a human fighter, and the group of rebels she belongs with, fight against demons that are coming into their world. Kate feels a pull to both men and in her own way tries to not come between them, even as they try to put her there.  Everyone has their own reason for fighting, duty, honor, fun and it takes all of them, even the most scared and timid to fight and send the Demons back where they came from.  In the end, betrayal is seen as the catalyst to the demons coming and to the destruction of the Sire/Childe bond.  This bond will either be made stronger, or will be lost.  I will patiently wait for the next installment.I was given a copy by the author in exchange for a honest review.",positive,book

I bought this one simply because I wanted to read a retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story. I got much more than I bargained for and loved every minute. It was one of those books that made me sad when I had finished it because I wanted it to keep going on. Loved the prince - what a great character and Beauty herself, is a very worthy and unusual heroine.It is funny and sad and a great commentary on our treatment of beauty queens. I liked the ending.

11520,"The Blue Mustang is a really great western written by one of the greatest western writers of all time.  Will Henry, a pen name, is up there with Zane Grey and Louis Lamour in terms of western writers.  This book is very historically accurate, set in post Civil war Texas, and captures the language, attitudes and atmosphere of the time really well.  &#34;Button&#34;, the hero, is a character that gets you on his side quickly, and you see the story unfold purely from his perspective, with no attempt by the author to take the God viewpoint and try to give an overview.  Things happen as seen by Button and when he is surprised, you are as well.  You also know his sympathies and biases as well, but are never quite sure about the other players until they act.  Altogether, one of Henry's better books and a terrific read if you like the genre.  Even if you are just a mystery fan, this is still a very good read.  Highly recommended!",positive,book
11530,"This is book was just about a perfect read! Yes there were a few editing issues with this particular copy, but the product description clearly states that the book is a reproduction of a book published before 1923 and may have occasional imperfections, such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. In light of this proclamation, it amazed my that so many reviewers still took the time to complain about the typos.  They were present but did not in the least distract from the story, at least for me they did not.  Furthermore, I could not in any way tell that this book had been scanned.Phoebe Deane is an orphan who as a child went to live with her half brother, Albert Deane.  Albert is a mild mannered, kindly man who sees only the good in everyone.  He is also a bit of a dolt.  His wife Emmeline is the evil stepmother type from Cinderella.  She works Phoebe to death and never has a kind word for the girl.  She is also crass with very little education.  Truthfully, she is just plain jealous of the beautiful, refined Phoebe.  Hiram Green, a neighbor of the Deanes' wants to marry Phoebe, but she despises the very sight of him!  The hero, Nathaniel, is a lawyer and the nephew of Judge Bristol, one of town's most prominent members.  Nathaniel lives and works in New York City, but often visits with his uncle who helped to raise him.  The book is set in a small town in New York State some time in the 1830's.  Nathaniel meets Phoebe when he comes upon her in the woods where she is crying after having read a letter from her deceased mother.  Nathaniel is immediately taken with the beautiful, soft spoken Phoebe.  I loved Nate and Phoebe, but if I had to pick a favorite character it would be Miranda, Phoebe's friend and self appointed guardian angel.  Hiram is determined to marry Phoebe and refuses to accept her rejection of his proposal.  He and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to accept him as a husband and he literally begins to stalk the poor girl!  Everytime Phoebe left her house, Hiram would be there with his unwelcome presence.  Hiram took note of Nathaniel's attentions towards Phoebe and between that and her constant rejection of his suit he begins to hate her and Nathaniel and starts scheming against them.  All the while he is still determined to have Phoebe as his wife.  If not for the enterprising Miranda, he might very well have succeeded in his evil plot.  Other characters include Marcia and her husband David Spafford, the hero and heroine from the first book of the Schuyler trilogy entitled ""Marcia Schuyler.""  I have not as yet read that book, but have just been lucky enough to obtain a free copy and so intend to read that next.  I am also looking forward the 3rd and final book in the triology ""Miranda"" in which the beloved Miranda finally gets her love match.  This book invoked a wide range of real emotions in me.  I  lauged out loud at many of Miranda's escapades, I literally felt Phobe's pain and suffering, and I completely despised Hiram Green.  One scene in particular where he and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to travel alone with Hiram had me clenching my teeth and wishing I was there to kick Hiram's sorry ass!!!!  He gets his in the end though and very nicely too, thanks in part to Miranda, of course!  Love that girl! And of course, love conquers all when Nate and Phoebe get to sail off into the sunset to begin their happily ever after.  I highly, highly recommend this book.  Jane Austen lovers especially will love this book.  It is a nice clean truly romantic story that touched me deeply.",positive,book

160,"Day of Sacrifice: The Prophecy (Day of Sacrifice Stories #1) by S. W. Benefiel(Discloser: I received this eBook free in order to write a review)Summary:Flora is approaching her twenty first birthday.  That is normally an exciting time for a young woman, but Flora isn't normal.  She is the first born in her family and, therefore, is the family sacrifice to the Gods.  Her entire life has lead up to the day of her death.  Her sacrifice ensures the Gods blessings on her family.  Flora is a bit of a rebelled but she knows her duty.  She pushes the limits to the fullest extent but she knows what will happen on her birthday.  Her pure body (she's a virgin) will be sacrificed to the Gods.My thoughts: (Some spoilers)For a short story, this novella was packed with a lot of story.  An entire background was given for a society that contains supernatural beings (witches, werewolves, and vampires) as well as lowly humans.  Included with the background for the story, a short tale was included.  While I think that the background information was well done, I'm not sure that the characters were as well developed.  The story happened very fast and I was unclear why chances were taken.  Some of it seemed very convenient to the story.  The idea of sacrifices was clearly disliked by many characters in the story but it seems that it has gone on for quite a few years.  Such ingrained tradition doesn't get challenged on a whim.  There just wasn't enough story invested to make any kind of changes.  Clearly, I am implying that there is a challenge to the idea but I won't say any more about it.Personally, the book was too graphic with too many uses of the F word but if those things don't bother you, then you may like this book.  With all that said, I give this novella a 2 out of 5.",negative,book

The book switches between first and third person narrative - in the same paragraph! You can't tell which character is talking or who they're talking to. The same thing with the tenses, mixing present and past - in the same sentence. It was PAINFUL.The truth is, there was some promise here. It's why I stuck around as far as I did. The characters were portrayed as being interested and involved in their own lives, with lots of hobbies. It makes a change from this type of alternate world scenario, where most characters are introduced as lonely, unfulfilled, etc. In other words, just waiting for the rescue. I would have liked to spend more time with this type of character instead, but I just couldn't stand it.I hope MacDonald gets some help from a friend willing to read this and offer instruction and suggestion in BASIC English.

The story line lacks direction and purpose, in the sense that the whole of the plot seems invented as a means to fill in the gaps around Aidan and Hannah's relationship and feelings for one another.As for ""learning to swim"", it does not feel like Hannah is really letting go of her fears.There were some good parts about the parent-child relationship, but mostly I was plain not convinced by the book.",negative,book
527,"Ok so........Preston has one of the coldest attitudes towards his wife Delight and for the life of me, I cannot fathom how she deserves such harsh treatment from him after all he is the one that stepped outside of their marriage not her (although she definitely played a large role in his need to seek comfort outside his marriage). I do believe Mr. Williams accurately displays how current society has no staying power in relationships. Instead of working through things, it's easier to toss it to the side and start anew with another. Which is exactly what Preston is doing and his conscience is working overtime trying to save him. He fails to acknowledge how his actions or lack thereof are affecting his current and unborn children. And to think, he is working his way through the ministry......oh no that is one church I would not be attending. This book much like the first, had poor editing and grammatical errors. Mr. Williams has a good story line, but needs more attention to detail and some fine tuning.",negative,book
586,"Pip comes home after being away for 9 years.  Her long absence stemming from being publicly rejected and humiliated by our lovely hero Cowboy.  Through the course of the book, he continues to reject her.  And what does she do to this?  She shows up at his place.  Pip was just utterly pathetic.  Every step of the way she was chasing after him and I just didn't like it.  Honestly if a guy doesn't call after almost week, you move on.  Pip had so little self-esteem it was just painful to watch her get rejected and chase after a man who didn't seem to view her as much more than a hook up for 97% of the book.  It was as if she thought that was all she deserved from a man.It also bugged me he slept with, had a serious relationship with and almost married Pip's sister.  There are some nice interactions between Pip and her girlfriends and those are actually some of the best in the book but generally they come off as unrealistic.  Also the fact that in the universe of this book Cowboy being a bona fide manwhore is acceptable but Pip is considered a slut because she messed around a bit with a guy, that really rubbed me the wrong way.  Especially being it is the women calling each other sluts and whores.  Why in the world would an author put down women for being sexual beings when she is writing erotica where the readers are almost all women?Basically, if you want to skim this to read the sexy bits go for it, you won't be disappointed, but if you want a good story, devoid of cheesy dialogue, without hero who is a total jerk and a heroine who gets rejected and insulted and just comes back for more then this might not be the book for you.  2 stars.",negative,book

701,"I had high hopes from the blurb - a unique and intriguing premise - and the story started out great. Unfortunately, the initial drama was over much too soon, and suddenly we're thrown forward eight years and the characters have changed completely.If I'm reading a ""reformed rake"" story, I want to SEE ""Lord Wicked"" change over time and EARN his redemption. Telling the reader ""it's eight years later and he's really really sorry"" just doesn't cut it. We miss out completely on the restless, conflicted wickedness and get him tirelessly patient, self-sacrificial and boring.Likewise, I would have been much more likely to have compassion and respect for the heroine if I could have SEEN the consequences of the initial drama. Instead, we leave Jillian as a 17-year-old caught up in the aftermath of a scandalous duel and never really understand what turned her into a rude, self-centered bitch. She refuses to acknowledge her own behavior in the fiasco and blames everyone else around her.I know the author was trying for an ""independent and feisty"" heroine, but Jillian veered off that narrow path straight into ""obnoxious and unlikeable.""A reformed rake needs someone worth reforming for, and Jillian - at least in the first part of the book - definitely isn't it. And Lord Wicked was already reformed by the time he got to her, so what's the point?",negative,book

769,"This one was better than First Contact. It concentrated more on story than on just fighting. I have a gripe about Tesh-Dar. In this prequel series, we keep getting ""told"" how mighty Tesh-Dar is. I got tired of the repetition quickly. Fine, the author wants to change his mythos in these prequels. I guess that is his prerogative, but it just feels wrong if the reader still remembers the other three books. It undoes the logic and therefore the suspension of disbelief. Tesh-Dar can walk through walls, send herself through space, but can't get out from under a cave-in???? Even taking into account that she was 100 years older, in the first three books, it just doesn't feel like it makes sense anymore. I'm going to finish this series (I bought them), but I really feel like this is not a prequel series worthy of the first three books. I really wish that this prequel series had just been about Tesh-Dar's life. What brought her to the point of not killing Reza when she first found him?",negative,book

920,"**Possible Spoilers** If I had to review this book in one word it would be 'ridiculous'.  I had high hopes the first few pages as the initial crime unfolded.  I went into it willing to suspend belief about a model using that profession as a cover for her real job as a CIA agent.  When I read Jaclyn's back story about her parents and her near blindness I thought, ""Hmmm...this is intriguing.""Before too long though it became apparent that this book was going to fail due to cartoonish bag guys, silly superhero type gadgetry, and a plot whose holes you could fly a plane through.What could have been an interesting thriller was anything but.  The villain of the piece was presented immediately.  A mystery surrounding who murdered the 46 people with poisoned bottled water would have been engrossing.  Instead, super baddie, (and comically sociopathic) Grant Chillings is dumped into the reader's lap.I kept waiting for a clever explanation for his horrible deeds and how, exactly, he planned to gain the monopoly on the bottled beverage industry but it never materialized.  His end game was that he was going to add poison to his competitor's products and the local water supply, thereby forcing people to drink his bottled water or nothing at all.  He wasn't going to get caught or prosecuted for his crimes because he was justified in commiting them and the government wouldn't dare touch him.  I'm no expert, but I believe that narcissists feel justified in their actions, but they aren't patently stupid.When he murdered the entire Board of Directors of his company I was thinking, ""You don't think somebody might notice you did that?""Then we come to our heroine.  Again, this could have been a very interesting character, but failed miserably.  We are asked to believe that the government could only spare one inexperienced CIA agent and a 'watchdog' for her after 46 people die from poisoning and later 9 children are hospitalized in another attempt.  That's how the government would react to terrorism?When Agent 'Snapshot's' partner is eventually killed she is told by the director of the CIA that she'll have to 'go it alone' since they can't spare anybody else to help out with the investigation.  Riiiigggghhhht.The rest of this tale consists of Jaclyn running around in a skin tight black jumpsuit that is equipped with special spy toys, using her custom made spy Porche to wage war on Grant Chilling's laughable 'army' (in one of Boston's main government buildings, no less), and the female President of the United States using Boston's Duck Boats to storm the villain's lair.  If it sounds stupid that's because it is...painfully so.Also, the author's insistence on describing Jaclyn's profuse sweating as she runs around Boston in her spy suit and trenchcoat became sickening.One surprise bright side to this book was the unintentional comedic factor.  I found myself chuckling at several of the more absurd parts such as Jaclyn's mercurial response to different situations, which I can't imagine any self respecting CIA agent indulging in.  Also, the idea of government sanctioned destruction of city property (including missiles launched from Jaclyn's car) had me laughing and shaking my head.Most amusing were the spy toys Jaclyn had at her disposal.  The unfortunate part is that none of them really helped her.  With the exception of her body armor and the security system evading app for her iPad, the bad guys still kept getting the jump on her.For a woman who was trained to use all her senses in deference of her very poor eyesight and who was required to take out several Navy SEALS as a part of that training; she was amazingly inept at defending herself.I considered giving this book 2 stars because it had potential, but decided that it merited only one because of its blatant waste of a good story line.",negative,book

941,"I didn't exactly like this book but I didn't hate it either. It is very long without any real story going on. The Character's aren't consistent and neither is the plot. Here are my problems with it:1. Jasmine (the heroine) she starts off seeming strong and independent. Then becomes immature at times and even submissive and sometimes flaky. Then she's back to acting strong again. She keeps flip-flopping from one way of thinking and acting to another.2. Keilan (her love interest) starts off seeming concerned about scaring her and not wanting to harm her in the beginning. He then turns into a dominating molester within the next chapter or so. He again becomes a sweet romantic love interest halfway in the book then dominating again. It's very confusing who these people are and what they are about. There were many other characters mentioned but you barely know them or understand where they are coming from either.3.The genre didn't seem to fit what was actually in the book. Yes there is some romance, there is fantasy/sci fi but there is also erotica in the book. I wish the author picked a genre and just went with it instead of tried to blend so many in one. She goes into descriptions of each in different scenes but the tone and feel of each scene doesn't always feel like the same book. Primarily the sexual aspects seemed really obscured compared to the rest of the book. I wish she would of just chose Full erotic novel OR Full romantic novel. Neither aspects seemed to blend together or stayed consistent in this book. Also the sexual aspects were so few and far between in the first half of the book that it seemed out of place.4. OK so the book is about a girl with Charmer abilities (can seduce shifter men with her scent basically) who happens to be best friends with a shifter princess. Why should we, as the reader, care about this and what does it have to do with the story itself? I'm not sure about that answer. Again if this was a full erotic novel some of the sexual themes and her seductive powers would make more sense. Like the sexy clothing and underwear in the beginning, is suddenly forgotten after the first &#34;molesting scene&#34; then she's able to wear dresses and regular shirts and pants. What was the point of that?? And a scene where an aphrodisiac was used then backfired to cause a loss of sex drive just didn't fit in. But since this is a romantic/action/fantasy I think?? I'm not sure why we should care or where the author was taking us with all this. Or why so many things were mention just to be resolved and forgotten about within a page or so later.So in a nutshell, there were things about it I liked. Things I didn't like and things that just didn't make sense to me. There were a lot of scenes and characters that could have been cut from this book to give it a more focused feel and shorten it. I hope the author chooses to rework this one and give it  more structure. She had a lot of cool ideas and interesting world she created but I feel her story needs more planing. I will not be following the series but I enjoyed most of the journey in this book.",negative,book

Rajah and Larkspur are completely out-of-place in this story - they speak like modern people (Larkspur likes to call a certain part of Rajah's body ""yummy"" frequently) and they're both supposed to be virgins but exhibit an amazing grasp of the mechanics and techniques of sex.  It keeps the reader from getting involved in the story at all - it's like reading an erotic story set in modern times that has somehow been gene-spliced with a story about a dragon and his human mate - and neither story benefits from the incongruity.Lark is also an annoying character.  She and her father were split up by pirates, she has no idea where he is, and she is kidnapped by a dragon.  She resists for about two minutes before deciding to spend the rest of her life with him.  I couldn't have much respect for somebody who didn't even care to find out how her father was or letting him know that she was okay.  And she's so demanding . . .

1039,"I kind of take the reviews with a grain of salt, it's subjective to each person's viewpoint. I liked other books by this author like Collision Course and No Souvenirs. I thought ok it's a short story, it can't be that bad. I was wrong, it ended at 1109 locations, 66 percent. The ending was so abrupt, it wasn't just having a few questions. It was almost as if the story stopped in the middle, I expected to get the next chapter when I turned the page and all of a sudden I am staring at the author's bio and I can't figure out what happened. I even rebooted my kindle thinking the story loaded wrong. Then spent 15 min combing through pages and pages of blurbs for other stories looking for a sequel with no luck. I have read many stories by this author, some I liked and some I didn't. However, I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now. I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well, but there was hardly any relationship development. Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry. If she had developed this story like the 2 books I already mentioned it would have been great. Mitchell chose the wrong story line for this short short story.

Is it a supernatural story, a thriller, a comedy, a romance, a family melodrama, a cheesy graphic erotic novel or all six? At times it seemed like it had 4 writers. A better writer may have combines all that but that was not the case, the plot was messy and the end has so many silly twists and turns it gave the reader whiplash. The characters were stereotypes and barely two dimensional. The Benji character was particularly annoying with all his gay sterotypical comments.

1666,"A very short story by two authors who wrote about two different persons with sadistic murder fantasies. Definitely not for those who have nervous disorders, heart ailments, gastric problems and those who are very sensitive, since this short story reveals how some people get wild pleasure and horrific thrill in killing a person slowly and painfully using some of the most deadly methods and instruments to kill.The basic underlying warning from the authors is about hitch-hiking (getting a free-drive  on the highways and expressways, from un-known persons).Two short stories, one with Donaldson (an elderly freelance courier man) and another Lucy (a young female guitarist). The first picks-up young boys and girls looking for a ride on the highway, ensures an isolated place and kills them most brutally after raping them. The murder is so horrendous that the victim is made to suffer the slow death by chopping off his/her vital organs one by one. Donaldson enjoys the screams and pain of the victim while doing so. Finally he burns the remains of the dead victim to keep the police clue-less. Similarly another young girl Lucy chooses cars on the highway for a lift/ride and uses a different strategy of injecting a slow poison in the drinks of her co-travelers. Later, she handcuffs the hands and ankles of her victims and ties them to their car with a rope. Then she enjoys the ride by brutally dragging them along the highway, first slowly and later at high speed, eroding them of their skin, flesh and bones one by one, until the point that only part of their skeletons are left.Absolutely no idea why the authors chose to write these stories, but I feel that they are one angle, inciting fresh sadistic and cruel ideas into the minds of the readers through such works. Any sensitive person might get heart stroke or nauseating effect while reading those parts of the book where the hunters enjoy the brutal murder process through their innocent victim&#8217;s extreme sufferings. Hope such people like Donaldson and Lucy do not exist in this world.Coming to the positive part of the short story, it is an indirect warning to road travelers on the following points from the authors.1: Don&#8217;t go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.2: Don&#8217;t pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be certifiably crazy.My rating is 2.5/5",negative,book

You&#8217;ve got one guy who starts the story by getting a right spanking off a few blokes, but we never find out why or what led up to it.

A crowded party, everyone would have either witnessed him do this or seen the bodies falling through the air and looked round at him. But no, the story just stops right there. It&#8217;s rubbish!Too often we&#8217;re left to guess at the ending. Two young boys playing on a beach hear a choir, a sure sign that there&#8217;s been loss of life at sea, and then their mother doesn&#8217;t turn up for tea. Are we supposed to assume she&#8217;s dead? She certainly wasn&#8217;t lost at sea. I didn&#8217;t know what to make of that story at all.Then there&#8217;s the story of three white lads attacking and raping Muslim women. It seemed to jump about all over the place, going back in time and introducing (I think) six Muslim men that I kind of lost track as to who was who.Nigel Bird seems a genuine chap, who&#8217;s very serious about his writing, and I feel awful offering such a poor review, especially as he&#8217;s evidently working so hard, but I have to be honest. I think his writing is actually quite good but his plots are rubbish. They have little more imagination than an average schoolboy.

She was a top notch detective that kicked butt to rise to the top of her field.When her friend goes missing she sets out to find her. In her search she winds up at a vampire club and meets Sin who advises her that her friend is at his mansion and he will take Chandra there. Once she gets there he ""seduces"" her ( if you can call it that) and from then on throughout the rest of the book Chandra is a complete and total idiot.Sin tells her he wants total dominance over her. She insists she cant do that but her clothes fall off at the sight of Sin or his brothers. And they pass her around like a piece of meat through out the story. And the bad part is that she thinks they are doing her a favor because she's full figured and they are handsome and she cant live with out sex with Sin and the brothers too.The story ends with her giving in to Sin and in proving to him that she will be completely submissive she allows him and his brothers to screw her in front of a whole night club full of vampires. And she gives up her career also.

I understand that, when conversing with each other, people do not say ""I am"" or ""it is"".  They say ""I'm"" and ""it's"".  This is especially true in high stress situations.3.  When writing, I know to identify the subjects of a scene with a break in text or a completely new chapter.  The writer tended to shift to new scenes by starting new paragraphs with zero indications that the scene was shifting.4.  I can frigging spell!!!!  More specifically, while using any decent word processing software, I recognize the significance of the red, squiggly lines under words.5.  Notice, there are zero run-on sentences in my review.I truly enjoy post-apocalypse-world stories however, if this is what passes for acceptable writing, I weep for our literary future.As for the characters, Dora, Tim and Mary would not survive more than a week in my zombie bunker.

I read a great deal of science fiction and paranormal fiction and enjoy both genres when the creatures are brought to life.  This one was not.",negative,book
2219,"I can see why many here enjoyed this book to the tune of four or five stars but for me, it failed on many different levels. If you are like me, it will most likely fail for you too. I'll try to convey my issues without any spoilers, but that restriction makes my task difficult.The setup is that the US has been supplying Turkey with weapons which Turkey has been using to exterminate Kurds. At one point, the book states that thousands of Kurd towns were destroyed with no telling how many Kurds were killed. Unable to stop the Kurds using these tactics, the Turks called for US support. In response, the US invaded and occupied Turkey to the purpose of suppressing the Kurdish objection to being exterminated. As a retaliation for the US supplying arms to the Turks and now for the US soldiers actively assisting in the genocide, some Kurds infiltrate the US to start a campaign of terror to get the US out of the Turkish / Kurdish fight. This is the setup and bluntly, at that point, I was ready to drop this book as perhaps too depressing to continue just due to this scenario. I mean, who is the bad guy at this point?Well, the author makes sure that the Kurds in the US are painted as so evil that you must side against them, but I keep thinking of those thousands of Kurdish villages so casually dismissed in this book on the way to making the Kurds and the leader of the terror campaign evil incarnate. Don't get me wrong. I have no tolerance for terror, but also have none for genocide either. The book offers a choice of nauseating alternatives for the good guys.As to the unfolding of the story (FBI and allies to stop the terror campaign) a good deal of the 'action' is laughable. Here are a few examples I can cite without spoilers. If I were willing to do spoilers, this review would be thousands of words long and a lot funnier.The Kurds are depicted as heartless superbly trained killers yet when they use a captive to lure others into a trap, they untie the captive sufficiently to allow him to signal his rescuers that this is a trap. In another scene, the gimlet eyed Kurdish assassin is charged with stalking and killing a victim. Rather than just shooting the victim, the assassin, in the best James Bond tradition, grabs the proposed victim up, puts her in a car and aimlessly drives around long enough for her to engineer an escape. In another gripping scene, this trained and expert assassin shoots a victim (with a 9 mm pistol) at close range, in the back of the head but she not only lives through it, but doesn't even seem to have much of a headache.In another asinine setup, the FBI needs to question a bunch of good old boys in a country bar to find the location of another country boy who may know the location of the terrorists. A reasonable tactic would be entering the bar and just saying ""We're the FBI looking for the terrorists. Can you tell us the address of So and So?"" That would have worked, but instead, the FBI female dresses up in costume to use sex to winnow the address from one of the bar's patrons. When that doesn't work, the FBI (and FBI ally) end up shooting, beating and terrorizing the patrons until they get the info they seek. Yikes! These guys are rednecks from Arizona. If you asked, they'd take up arms and attack the terrorists themselves. No need to shoot and beat them.One more example. After the terrorism starts in the US, the law enforcement community starts a manhunt, of course, to find the terrorists. They can't find them but when the Maryland mafia decides it wishes to find them, it does so in about 15 minutes with no explanation except an oblique comment about tracking them through their sewage. After the mafia finds the bad guys locale, it fails to inform the FBI for most of the book which gives the bad guys some more time to commit atrocities.I haven't even gotten to the superhuman powers some FBI agents have or the utter stupidity supposedly committed by senior White House staff - all utterly unbelievable.If you just want to rah rah the US and  can dismiss the portrayed genocide of Kurds and can suspend disbelief when superhuman FBI agents get stymied by bozo Kurd terrorists, this one is for you. If you are sickened by the killing, then perhaps not.",negative,book
2230,"I would like to think that I am capable of suspending my skepticism and enjoy a good escapist romance, and that was how I felt the majority of this book. Unfortunately by the end things just got way too out of hand for me to continuing making excuses for the story. The story was somewhat cute but the title should have been a major indication of the style of writing. If the author seriously couldn't come up with anything more creative for a title other than Touchdowns and Potions, you really can't have the highest expectations for the writing and plot line (my mistake), because that was literally what the story was, a football player and a girl with a love potion.This could have been a interesting story and I do commend the author for avoiding a lot of cliches but there was little to no character development and within a span of a few pages (spoiler alert) everything is perfect, then Andy is a liar, Jenna conveniently has a voicemail for a job in Texas, airline ticket provide and all (IN A MESSAGE BEFORE THEY EVER SPOKE WITH HER) so she's off to the airport, and then Andy's slimy football teammate is trying to rape Jenna in the middle of no where. If you're reading this a pulling a double take, yeah that just happened.For the price it's not bad and if you can suspend your disbelief, go for it, but the writing was mediocre and repetitive and characters were incredibly one demensional. The only semi-redeeming element was Jenna's relationship with the ""meddling older woman"" but even that is pretty ridiculous.

Great premise. The execution, however, left me wanting.I'm usually quick to accept the love at first sight thing when supernatural/other worldly forces are involved (angels/demons/vampires/werewolves/etc), but this wasn't a case of love at first sight, mating, or any other supernatural love-mojo. Yes, they were attracted to each other, but it wasn't love and he continued to insist (in his thoughts) that he didn't know why his fellow angels would fall for human women.They were only together for a day until they were bumping uglies (which isn't entirely unheard of - several people engage in overnight relationships) and ""in love"". That part was a little too difficult for me to accept, despite the angel & witch aspect.And the revenge that she wanted against her cheating jerk of an ex-boyfriend? Was just to make him jealous by going to a club and dancing provocatively with her angel. Felt a little too much like high school to me.I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters, and while I understand that this is a novella (which means word count restrictions), I didn't feel that the story was fleshed out enough. Maybe if it had been longer and the characters given more time to get to know each other (or have a supernatural force pulling them together like the werewolves' mating instinct) I might've liked it better.",negative,book

As another reviewer said, what professional would sleep with a wild cat in her home, and sleeping next to her like an overgrown tabby?  This author really needs to watch a few episodes of Animal Planet's ""Fatal Attractions"" series.The ""heroine"" was an idiot.

I finished the book but skipped parts here and there to get it over with. Skye and Jaide are really not likeable, there is hardly any tangible tension between them and the great dialogues seen in the Charmer is noticeably missing. And why does all the women have to be impregnated in the books and in such an offensive manner in this book? I am sorry, but it is not realistic at all, that a woman would just shrug her shoulders by being impregnated against her will. Add to that the fact that all seem to be lying to Jaide and she at some point apologises for having trust issues with Skye because of his and the others' lies is really beyond me. Also a lot of her actions seems to stem from something I cannot pick up. Is i supposed to be stubborness?I do like the dominant male characters and I can be very forgiving of their previous actions as long as there is some growth and change in the characters that makes a happy end believable.

They are few and far between and hard to find.Since there weren't any reviews I downloaded a sample, it  was lovely, so I bought the book.  It was $5.11 for my Kindle, around average for a FULL LENGTH ebook.  Imagine my suprise when I realized after 20 mins. of reading, I was 60% thru the book!  Nowhere in the book description does it say Novella or Short Story, PLUS the book ends way before 100%(93% approx)they don't give page numbers, sorry non-Kindlers.  That's the only way I can give the book length! So, I paid full book price and got the equivalent of 4-6 chapters.BUT, I think the actual story itself was decent. If it could be expanded upon and made into a full length book, it would be worthy of it's price and I would have given it 4 stars(If it had been a good rewrite of course!)I do think that Amazon should perhaps make it mandatory for authors of books/novellas/short stories under a certain word count to inform their readers of the length of the book.  It's not right to pay for and expect a full length book yet get something entirely different.  EVEN IF the story is cute.  Most of the other stories around this length run from $.99-$1.99.

2759,"2.5 stars.I have a somewhat two-minded opinion about Force of Law.On one hand, it was a nice, light and entertaining enough read. A fun parody--even though trying too hard at times. Nothing heavy. Nothing that requires much attention/concentration. Nothing breath-taking and outstanding that will be remembered forever, but entertaining, nonetheless.On the other hand, it just was too much, at times--even though the book is intentionally cliched and over the top:Law is this alpha male of all alpha males. He's super talented, smart, intelligent, successful, powerful, dominant, rich, handsome, fearleass, brave, honourable, strong-minded. He's a billionaire. He's got the world laid out to his feet. Everyting he does or touches turns into gold. He might be a god..., he certainly feels and behaves like one. He's awfully arrogant or sure of himself--however you'd like to interpret it. When planning a picnic, he's using his helicopter or jet to get there, flying the thing himself, naturally. When confronted with a gun (while being unarmed himself) he fearlessly and single-handedly, and, of course, successfully--was there ever any doubt?--wrestles the gun-holding ""opponent"" for the gun, knocking him out easily while he's at it. And that's that. He joined the force and went to Afghanistan for no other reason than to kill Osama Bin Laden himself. While fighting bravely at the front for freedom and against terrorism, he's running his corporation via satellite (his private one, of course) and quite successfully so.In contrast to Law Tom--although being refered to as tough (why?)--can only be compared to a damsel in distress, helplessly waiting for the shining knight in armor to save the day or, which would be more appriopriate in Law's case, to save the world. I don't really like this kind of dynamic in a relationship, neither straight nor gay.And the rape-but-not-rape scene wasn't anything I liked very much, either. Tom was scared to death, waiting for the inevitable while trying to convince himself that it won't be all that bad, that it will be OK, and he just realizes that he's actually turned on as hell the second he feels Law's *** (or, to put it nice: member) up his virgin ***. That was too close for comfort. (A D/s [BDSM] dynamic is fine, even hot, but here it isn't. The thing between Law and Tom is not a D/s thing, not in that way.) I couldn't find anything remotely romantic in that.Yes, this book wants to be a parody, wants to be over the top.

Carly, an ex-marine, accepts and is flown to Kosovo with her new ""husband"".The main challenge with writing novellas is to sufficiently flesh out characters and plots so that the story is complete and engages the reader.That was not achieved in this case.  Both main characters remain a mystery and when exactly did they fall in love? In the plane? In the hotel room? They still don't know anything about each other so why are they attracted?The black-op is put together with no preparation, no insight and with a civilian who has been out of training for years. I could not believe the plot for one second. To cap is all off, I found the bedroom scene in Kosovo in bad taste and off-putting. I dislike seeing anyone being used that way without their agreement. It is demeaning and for this alone, this book deserves no star.",negative,book
2851,"I won't be buying any more of this author's offerings. I wonder if some of the authors of the almost free Kindle books write according to a template: horrific violence lipsmackingly detailed, sexual details which would have shocked even Kinsey, jibes at the Catholic Church and a bit of detection thrown in almost as an afterthought.  As someone who had read detective stories by e.g. Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Ngaio Marsh etc most of my life this new stuff I am accidentally discovering on Kindle really should be flagged ""graphic violence and sexual details"" .

2920,"I didn't expect to write a review of this book.  I read a lot of books, way too many to do reviews for all of them, so I generally only write reviews if they were exceptionally good or really bad.  I don't want to take the time to review an average book.  And this one should have been average.  It reminded me of an 80's Harlequin, with Yanis, rich and powerful, dominating Lee throughout most of the book.  I was ok with that because I was in the mood for a ""mean"" hero and I thought the storyline flowed pretty well.  I noticed in reviews of her other books that people complained about grammatical errors.  There were plenty of those, but if the story is good enough I don't mind overlooking them.What I couldn't overlook was the overuse of the word ""had"".  By the middle of the book it was to the point that I couldn't even concentrate on the story because ""had"" kept jumping out at me.  Sometimes several in one sentence.  Out of curiosity I counted them once and there were 16 just on one page.  So I basically just skimmed the last half of the book because it was too painful plowing through the ""hads"".  But the story itself was good enough that I wanted to see how it ended.If not for all of the ""hads"" throughout the book I would have given it 3 stars.  It's a nice average story.  I got Kidnapped the Wrong Sister by this author because it was free and I'm sure I'll read it, but I noticed one of the reviews for that book also mentioned that had was overused, so it's obviously a trend.  That's too bad because her books have a lot of potential.  I don't think I will pay for any more of her books though.",negative,book
2956,"I would love to give this book at least a 4 star rating. However, there are a too many things wrong with it that cannot be overlooked. First of all it sometimes felt like it was written by two or more different people; one who writes well, one not so good, and a really bad one whose style is quite juvenile. The knowledge of the science is very good most of the time and some of the writing is sometimes so sophisticated it made me think that this was an experienced writer but then it would go downhill again.There are a number of typos, misspellings, and wrong use of words, for example: their instead of they're, conger (an eel) where the word should have been conjure. One of the major characters from the Mars site named Clapton just disappears about half way through the story after the capture by the aliens - no I don't mean the aliens killed him or something else dire happened to him - the author just forgot him. Also it would seem to me that a nuclear winter lasting 300 or more years would not have resulted in just a colder climate in Oregon but an all out ice age.I know writers (and obviously editors) tend to get lazy due to the use of spell checkers but for goodness sake, USE A GRAMMAR CHECKER as well.Like I said, I would have given 4 stars due to the plot, action, and the interesting take on time travel but . . .",negative,book

3056,"******SPOILER ALERT*******This is my second HKW book after ""Hell Bent"".  I understand ""The Chosen Soul"" was HKW's first book written some 10 years ago, and that it was revised by the author after reading some of the reviews.  Well, I think it might have needed a second revision.First off, let me say the author writes very well in general.  She also is highly imaginative and her action/battle scenes are exciting. As I'm still fairly new to the Fantasy Genre, it did take me a few chapters to immerse myself in the world setting.  As in ""Hell Bent"" I felt the situations were reasonably complex and the characters numerous.  It took me a while to sort everything and everyone out.  In fact, by the 40% mark (no page numbers on Kindle) I found myself growing confused about the three male love interests, mixing them up to such an extent that I had to go back to re-establish their identities.  They were all wonderfully handsome, had numerous magical powers, hypnotic eyes and all of them fell heavily for Raven/Winter.  That became a problem for me as the story progressed.  I got a little tired of all the handsome men wanting her so badly.The next problem for me was our heroine, Raven/Winter, herself.  She was kinda wimpy right up to the very end of the book.  I'm sure that finding out your father is a devil would be a shock, as would realizing you have demonic powers of your own.  But when your life, or those of your loved ones are threatened repeatedly (and I do mean, repeatedly, as in everyone is out to kidnap or rape you over and over again), then own those powers and use them to save yourself, woman!  Can't just stand on those exceptional good looks.Full points for the many great plot twists.  However, at one crucial point about 60-70% along, I must have been distracted and missed an important point.....that Cruor was Gray Beard!  Boy, I felt dumb over that one when I had to go back a few chapters to sort it out.  It threw me off that the character was called by both names later on in the narrative.On the whole, the plot was a little disjointed, but the individual plot ideas & inventions were interesting and imaginative.  I liked some of the characters a lot, like Loki and Abonides.  I found the names a little bit difficult at first but got used to it by the end.Perhaps, ultimately a bit dark in tone, and I do agree with other reviewers that the novel ended abruptly, like ""time to wrap this up now and finish up in a sequel some day"".  Raven/Winter didn't win points by resigning herself to life with the Elven Prince, but I guess she was just being practical since Drake was gone.  She was probably tired after fighting off all her abductors and needed a good rest.I will be reading the author's other books as I bought them all, they were such a good price.  But I do hope they will be a more satisfying read than ""The Chosen Soul"" was.June 9, 2011 - Edited typos.",negative,book

Maybe I blinked and missed it, but despite the event occuring so she can turn into a wolf, the scene isn't there in the book!  She never becomes a wolf.  (maybe you have to buy book 2 for that?)

3340,"This book has a rather farfetched, but interesting premise...that a group of West Pointers going back over a hundred years are secretly controlling the world.  Could have been fun, but the author seems to have strung together a number of separately written sections, while forgetting what happened in the previous sections!  Its nuts, i.e. characters show up injured but no injury was ever described, characters jump from one location to another with no connection, and there seems to be no point to any of it.Very poor writing, even worse editing (does this author even have an editor?).  Mayer needs to clean up his writing, and get it edited.  In addition, his plot is rather thin, and if he's going to go for the outlandish, at least make it a little believable.But my biggest complaint about the book is that it isn't even exciting or particularly interesting. This is no thriller, in fact it drags along so slowly, and fails to grip the reader to such a degree it is actually quite boring and laborious to plod through.Update: After reading the book, the ending was fairly good and some action sequences just prior to the ending were't so bad. So, I'm upgrading the book from one star and making it two stars.  All of my previous comments stand, and Mayer will hopefully turn out something better next time.",negative,book

Unfortunately it was not for me.  The sample was pretty good and I liked the setup, but it quickly went downhill fast, then began racing to totally unbelievable.  There were gaps in the logic of the drug-dealing brother of the main character, which I think were just used to further the &#34;plot&#34; (which was quite horrific at that point).

He realizes that she is his mate (it doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous), saves her life, and then they do it.  Oh, and there is a powerful magic book and some mean werewolves.

Matt feels Savannah is in love with him too and wants him but has been repressed and damaged by her father.  So, what better way to get her to admit her feelings and relinquish control to Matt for him to love and care for her then binding her, hanging her from the ceiling videotaping it and letting each one of his business partners (four other men) have a go at her.  Oh, but there are rules...they can't penetrate her.  How generous of Matt.  One gives her oral sex, the other a device that penetrates her vaginally and anally), the other her breasts and the last her backside.  Each gives her gifts too, you know, because they care and love her.  She gets a sexual device, nipple clamps, pearls (that need to be cleaned because they were inserted into her rear!!) and a diamond engagement ring.  SERIOUSLY?!  Back to Savannah...she has never had sex (oral, vaginal, anal)let alone any BDSM.  They do this to her and at times in the book she says she wants to say no but she can't get the words out as if she is paralyzed.  She does so ""no"" and they still continue at one point.  So, just because her body is responding and they are the experts it is determined that she really doesn't mean ""no.""  Also, Matt is digging his fingernails into his hand and turning away at times when he allows these other men to do this to her.  At the ends he admits he it was too much and he wanted to stop it.  But, he doesn't.  It is not rape but what I got from it is that she was soo paralyzed by fear and the novelty and intensity of these sexual experiences, as her need to not fail at anything (including giving into Matt with this) that she was not in the right state of mind to make and VERBALIZE appropriate decisions.  Again, at times she did say ""no"" and ""I can't take anymore.""  Savannah didn't have a relationship with Matt that he could adequately judge her wants and needs and what was best for her.

4613,"Isabella was a librarian for the ""committee"", a group guarding earth from otherworldly icons. When she learned the Whitelaws, werewolves, possessed a very powerful book that could do untold harm, she infiltrated the compound and stole it. While fleeing she was gravely injured, just as the werewolves move in for the attack, a werejaguar Donovan comes to her rescue. He has to change her into a werejaguar to save her life because she is going to die. When she awakens her body is healed and she is just as determined as ever to destroy the book.  From the moment Donovan saw her he felt a connection. By the time she was turned, he knew that she was his soul mate. Isabella doesn't trust him with information about the book but does have sex with him moments after learning she was turned into a werejaguar.Black Moon had potential but failed miserably. Normally I overlook grammar, usage, ect errors but this novella was riddled with them. In many places, the author used a noun and pronoun together such as ""Donovan he....."" The kindle formatting is awful. The close word repetition was enough to have me going a little crazy and where the author varied her usage it was often done poorly as if she clicked the thesaurus button and randomly picked a word.Granted this was a novella it lacked any depth. The characters were boring at best and had no real likable qualities. There was very little dialog and what little there was did not flow. The sex scene was so poorly written I ended up skipping half of it. I quit reading at 84% because it was just too boring.

I forced myself to finish the book so that I wouldn't write a bad review in case it had a great ending.Alex is supposed to be a fairly intelligent assistant professor at a university. Now I can understand when the transformation first occcurs how one might be in shock and possibly do some stupid things. But his stupidity never ended. He quickly surmised that the world was very different and very bloodthirsty, but every time he found something different he started to act up in so as to draw attention to himself and his companion, thus endangering their lives. He can't find all of his relatives in the registry, so he acts up in public. He discovers there are no libraries, so he goes running off in a huge distressed huff. For some reason he was totally surprised when his money was no good, even though he knew this world was dramatically different from his own. On and on - he was shocked when anything was different from his world. No one, and especially not a well educated history professor, is that stupid, over and over and over again.

4716,"There are a few issues I have with this book, and a few questions too.First, after reading the synopsis I thought the idea of the story interesting enough to give it a go. The $0.00 price was a help in making that decision too. I've had a run of bad luck with some of the self-published books on amazon as far as their depth, intelligence, and attention to grammar and punctuation, so being free was a big Plus.In the first chapter, actually within the first few pages, some of the most intentionally unintelligent comments are made by the main character that made me instantly close-out of my Kindle for PC and go hunting for a different book to read. The part where the protag does something that no human should be able to do, but then attributes this strange ability to a weird ""coincidental gift from the universe"", or something just completely crushed any hope I had for the story. And then shortly after, when seeing something mysterious in a place she is not supposed to be and that poses great danger to her, she chases after it, I had to take deep calming breaths. Where's the underline in here? She CHASES it.But after a fruitless and halfhearted search for a different book, I returned to this one, determined to give its author the benefit of the doubt. I'm not about to go into further detail because it would only make me look like I was unhappy with how the story unfolded, and that's not the case at all. There were just so many inconsistencies and random acts of emotion and awkward mannerisms and social interactions it was frustrating at every turn.I found there to be multiple places throughout the story where the characters would say or do something totally alien to the set mood, or completely confusing to me. Reading this story was like looking into the mind of a mood swinging ADD spaz with wings and super powers. Her attention seemed to jump from one thing to the next so fast and sometimes seemingly so random I wanted to tell the character to sit still and be quiet for a minute. There's no continuous focus of one thing at a time, there's no consistency to the moods or attitudes of the characters, and above all- the action scenes were down right confusing. I'm not an accomplished writer, and no, I have not published anything I've written, but I do know a good fight scene, or action scene when I read one, and those in this story had me more confused than before the scene happened.Also, the dynamics between characters was hard to follow. Each time Breandan and Devlin were in the scene, all I kept thinking was ""WHY is he leaving her with Devlin when we all KNOW Devlin has bad intentions for Rae???"" or ""WHY did he just turn his back on an enemy after a supposedly vicious sword fight?"" There were so many ""Why?!"" thoughts after each scene containing the three characters I had to take breaks just to calm myself down from the frustration I was experiencing over it.The concept of the story is fascinating, and the characters individually are interesting and (evil personalities aside) are likable. But the conflicts of what the characters say versus what they actually do, and sometimes the mood swings they express are just confounding. There's no other way I can describe it without going into a full rant. I really wished this story were better because I think the world the writer had created is fun and it definitely sets my imagination whirling but the incongruity of the characters just ruined it for me.",negative,book
4741,"I know a lot of reviewers read this book not fully realising what it was, but I had read the Amazon reviews, and knew what it was about, and decided to give it a go anyway.Basically, this is a sequel, and doesn't work as a standalone, at all. I get that sequels are for people who have read the first book, but a little backstory never hurt anyone. There is *none* in this book, and given that it's free, I think there should have been an expectation that this would be peoples' introduction to the series.So, anyway, Holly is eight months pregnant, and 'married' to three brothers who won't have sex with her because they're afraid of hurting her, or the baby.Eventually she manages to convince (i.e. corner and threaten with 'the wrath of a hormonal woman') two of the brothers, and have sex with them. Only one of these sex scenes appear in the book, the other fades to black.Eventually, she has the baby and everyone ends up happily ever after. The description of the birth is a little...graphic for my taste. I would much rather have read about that second sex scene than listen to one of the brothers try to make sure Holly had passed the placenta *shudder*What's really irritating, is the extract at the end of this book is intriguing, but because of the lack of characterisation, backstory and world-building (I know it's not fantasy, but there is zero description of Holly's location and surroundings), means I won't read that book.I only finished this book because it was mercifully short, and I would have felt very guilty giving up on a short story.",negative,book

4963,"I admit it, I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases, because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn. He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud ""Huh? That's it?!"" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for. In fact, it should really be free if you ask me.",negative,book
4979,"This is the story of a post (and continuing) apocalyptic planet with space stations as places people live to escape the planet Earth.  Great idea overall.There are action bits, bombs, running, killing, evil plots and good people.  So, there is a lot to the story.  Too much in fact. The insertion of everything imaginable (life, death, human engineering, enhanced people, natural people, alien types, mystical types, mutants, ghosts, goddesses, men plotting overthrow of government, Marshall law, love story, sex, nuclear war, space travel and fights, supernatural events and so on).  Due to so many plot devices, the story flow was rushed, overdone in some spots, incomplete in others.  And led to a lot of jumping around in tale that really (while ended) did not flow in cohesive /cogent manner with regard to story arc development overall.The contridictions of characters was just conveniently explained away without direction.  Just plopped into story via a tell vehicle when needed as was not in keeping with initial characterizations at onset of meeting character.  Or, not explained at all (why not all girls or women who met the goddess did not have hair color change - just two?  Why only one of those two branded with tattoo?  Those type inconsistencies never addressed.  We just need accept them...).  The guy was pretty accepting of kiss without real reason behind it.  ""No reason honey?  Oh, well then, okay.  Come on over and kiss me now."" (Um, not so much believable).  There were many such contrived bits that seemed like author started something and just was unable to come up with continuation or plausible conflict resolution.I think many will forgive the stilted pacing and the contrived conveniences due to novelty of premise.

The author made it quite clear that only virgins were desired and kidnapped, but yet they were morally loose enough to commit sex in public immediately after their weddings.  Drape or no drape, it was still sex in public.  I was definitely not won over by the fact that the men were so pathetic they ejaculated almost as soon as the sex began.  ""I can't wait.""  Really?

By the end, I was gritting my teeth and forcing myself to finish because of an attachment to the characters and their plight.

The problem grew worse the further I read, until by the end, every page -- and sometimes every paragraph on every page -- resembled Swiss cheese.Normally, I excuse minor formatting errors in ebooks. Mistakes happen. Often, the publisher (or the author, if the book is self-published) discovers the problem and issues a corrected version as soon as possible. More than two years after its release, the desperately flawed Kindle version remains unfixed, and the glitches are anything but minor. Why?

5511,"""The Door at the Top of the Stairs"" was written by Alison Holt.  This appears to be a third book for Ms. Holt and a departure from her previous two detective mystery novels. The current novel is of the psychological thriller genre. The book is written in conversational dialog spoken by the characters. The writing is straight forward and does not offer any degree of complexity in structure which should be generally acceptable by a wide audience.The story is about a young female police officer, ""Jesse Shaunessy"" twenty six years old, who was dismissed from the police force after five years of service. The police psychologist assessed Jesse to be too traumatized to continue to serve. Jesse was an undercover narcotics agent. She witnessed her partner ""Pete"" accept a bribe and sell her out to a narcotics dealer who subsequently tortured her in retaliation for shooting his brother.Jesse, looking for work, shows up at the horse farm run by 57 year old Morgan Davis and her 65 year old life partner Dr. Ryland Caldwell. Ryland is a retired psychologist who after observing the odd behavior (and physical scars) on Jesse, engages in her rehabilitation. The story of Jesse's abduction and torture is then revealed through a series of ""regressive sessions"" devised by Ryland as therapy.  While this is all going on, there is a secondary plot afoot being crafted by one Cody Maitland, a college dropout, hired by Morgan as a favor to her neighbor, Cody's father. Cody is featured as a plainly despicable young man bent on causing Jesse to get fired through his plotting of nefarious incidences that Jesse will be blamed for.At about the time that Jesse is recovered from her therapy, the story, in an unexpected twist of events, culminates in the conclusion of the drama and some additional revelations about Jesse and her ordeal.There were a number of things about this book that I did not care for. The character of Jesse and Morgan were a bit too overdone for my likes. While Jesse may have had some reason for her incorrigible behavior, Morgan's was not comprehensible in comparison. Further, I thought the male attributes applied to Morgan made her look foolish at times. The description of Richard as a ""brilliant"" narcissistic killer also seemed misplaced. There was nothing revealed about Richard that lead the reader to conclude that he was ""brilliant"".  Quite the contrary, he came across as decidedly evil, but not particularly bright as evidenced by a number of silly misjudgments.  The Character of Cody seemed equally misplaced. It was uncharacteristic for a young man like Cody to have harbored a hatred so thoroughly consuming as to result in his destruction. That's not to say it couldn't happen, just that there was no particular background given about Cody that explained his behavior and thus left the reader to his own conclusions. Finally, I did not find any appreciation of the life style portrayal of the female characters. While there is nothing inherently wrong (a non-religious view) with such a portrayal, I didn't find it necessary to advance the story. Certainly there have been many good books written with characters of alternate life styles, but these almost entirely are about the characters as persons and not about their life style per se. In this case, the depiction of all the females in the story as lesbian did not offer any necessary structure to the drama. If Morgan had been Martin, it wouldn't have mattered. Unfortunately for me, some of the intimate descriptions made me decidedly uncomfortable - as in the same realm as imagining 26 year old Anna Nicole Smith with 88 year old J. Howard Marshall II.....creepy.Overall I would recommend this novel only with reservations. I think there are underlying issues with it that would disenfranchise too many readers.",negative,book

5531,"I'm not sure what to categorize this book. It is more like a romantic novel with some scifi hints.  It's definitely not what I was expecting.  I would've liked if the authors gave a brief recount of why earth is now the ""old earth"" and what led up to the change.  I was disappointed in the old time view on a women's worth and arranged marriages.  The heroine was wishy-washy and a pathetic excuse of a women who let's a guy walk all over her, an undeserving and immature guy at that.  For being so far into the future and technologically advanced, the book's society seemed no better than our ancestors of 500 years ago.  In truth, this story focused more on the character's relationship than the potentially exciting world the Ilona Andrews team could've built.  The sex took up a lot of this novella and it was mediocre at best, and clearly one of the two duo has a breast fetish.I love the Ilona Andrews duo, their Kate Daniels series is exceptional and the Edge series, while more romance oriented than I usually like, is still fantastic!  Never would've thought I'd be rating any of their books this low, but.......here we are.To my fellow dark urban fantasy readers, regardless of my gripes this novella had some rays of interest and wasn't entirely bad, but it wasn't engaging and spellbinding either.  I don't think you'd be missing anything if you skipped this, however, if you do indeed read this novella I offer a forewarning.

If you can get past the fact that the poor heroine is kidnapped, then used as a reward only to be immediately used sexually and then spouts out the phrase &#34;I love you&#34; to the hero in almost the same chapter then you'll enjoy this read; if you're like me and this is a hard pill for you to swallow, then I would err on the side of caution and skip this one.

5826,"I like reading menage and unconventional relationship books, and after reading Night is Darkest, I really had high hopes.  This book however was cringe-worthy and just plain bad.  There were so many plot holes, and I was amazed I didn't fall into one.  They are so obvious, that several times I put the kindle down, and vented to my friend over how stupid some of the scenes were. I was amazed that while my eyes were rolling, they managed to stay inside my head.  Razor was shot in the last book, and is still recuperating - yet despite his physical condition, his department sends him undercover to be a contestant on a ""Dancing Like the Stars""-type competition.  Huh?  The heroine escapes a bad situation with money and a Ferrari (which she proceeds to park in a bad neighborhood) - but no one steals the car.  Oookkkay....  She hides in plain sight...on a tv show...and they get 2 days to practice....and still she manages to teach her partner everything, her physical injuries from the previous situation don't impede her ability to wear heels, no one seems to notice bruising....and her custom made dress is done in under 24 hours.  Alrighty then.  Not to mention the most disturbing scene - I actually cringed my way through it.  The cops need to verify the heroine's virginity status.  Despite two of them being married to a nurse, they choose to send Razor and another friend into a bedroom to verify the status themselves.  Yep - that's how to do it.  Why go to a hospital....a doctor...the aforementioned nurse....when you CAN DO IT YOURSELVES!  And regardless of the cringed and creeps that scene gave me - it somehow devolved into an opportunity for her to give him oral sex.  Really?  Seriously?  Bleech.  And because I am on a roll, all of the officers go on stakeout inside a sex club.  But the second they hit the door, they are all bumping and grinding.  Good thing they were on the clock - would hate to see what they would get up to in their free time....oh wait....I cannot begin to express how disappointed I was with this book.  Oh - yeah I can - I just did.  Save yourself the time, the effort and the money.  Reading the back of a cereal box would be more entertaining.",negative,book
5844,"Nyssa is a spoiled brat at the beginning of this story. Sadly, she doesn't improve much: she doesn't seem to mature at all as the plot progresses, despite supposedly falling in love and learning things that should have offered perspective. She's whiny, rude, and selfish right to the end. Theron, the titular Guardian, is described as a highly engineered dominant protector. He was more appealing than Nyssa, but the near-instant and repeated collapse of his deeply ingrained discipline around her made me roll my eyes. The ""futuristic"" vocabulary chosen by the author also detracted from any potential romance.",negative,book
5922,"I'm sorry- no offense meant to the writer- but seriously?!?!?!SERIOUSLY!?!?!??!?!I hate leaving negative reviews. Much of the time I'll skip reviewing just because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Not this time.This book lacks character development and the protagonist (who has zero development- in fact I'd say she has negative character development as far as I am concerned- if that is even possible!) is nothing. This seems like a book written by a teenager... a young teenager, but it turns out not to be the case.There are stereotypes galore- i.e. her token black roommate named ""Tyreen"" that says ""mo fo"" a lot. I found that eye-rollingly offensive.Our leading lady- in the midst of a disaster at her college, asks if they will be renting a chalet in Gatlinburg. Her family is supposed to be from Richmond, VA and she is going to school in Tennessee. It's not a chalet down here. It's a cabin. And if serial killers/monsters are taking over your college and killing a bunch of co-eds that look like you, do you really want to go to a cabin in the woods?! Then again, our character is in the lead for the Darwin award.The protagonist, Txema (obligatory exotic name probably looked up on baby name website), is really stupid. There were how many murders in 24-48 hours and she 1) decides to meet her boyfriend after dark at the library across campus instead of him picking her up at her dorm for no apparent reason than she wants to die and 2) she decides that not only her personal safety and that of her beloved roommate is worth less than an iPad and a book. She sneaks past guards put up for the safety of those on campus. When her boyfriend's house is torn to shreds it literally doesn't cross her mind until Tyreen verbally tears her up for not calling the police.She doesn't even care to really find out what her boyfriend's fate was until he is thrust back into her life to knock her up with an audience. She's trying to figure out who she wants to sleep with with literally no regard beyond a ""I wonder if my boyfriend, best friend and her boyfriend were eaten"" (not a quote, more of a paraphrase).This story has (as mentioned before), no character development. The plot was completely disorganized and stupid.If you are looking for a Pulitzer prize winner- Don't bother.If you are looking for a great adventure/fantasy book- Don't bother.If you are looking for a decent romance book- Don't bother.If you are looking for some mindless drivel to keep you preoccupied- Don't bother.SERIOUSLY- pass on this one.",negative,book

To have 2-3 people speaking in one paragraph, often without full stops, was very confusing.Then there was the head hopping! One voice at a time, please, and hopefully within different chapters, or if not, with double paragraph gaps between each.

The eroticism, while handled all right, too frequently takes a backseat to the reader having to stop and wonder why on earth the author made that particular decision.This story (which isn't really about an orgy, FYI) is one of the weaker ones in this Ellora's Cave promo series.

You don't have to read them in order but I suggest you do.This was offered as a free kindle book, and I have to say the price was about the worth.  I have to say that even for a novella this story was way underdeveloped.  This installment is the story of Anna Parker (Maggie's sister) and Pete Crenshaw (Adam's business partner).  Anna is a recently divorc&eacute;e and mother of a 5-month old baby boy.  Her ex-husband, Brad, is well...a plot filling character.  There is not much to this novella - it took about 20 mins to read and forget.  Not the usual quality I expect from this author.The other installments in the series:The first installment,Redline Lover: Take Me, Lover, Book 1was better than this one - there was more development (both character and plot).It reunited Maggie Parker (Anne's sister) with former race driver Adam Richards (Pete's business partner).  Maggie is a journalist who wants to tell Adam's story, but he has secrets to protect.The third installment,Adventure Lover:Take Me, Lover, Book 3, seems unrelated to the prior installments.

6232,"Orphaned Wiley had a hard life, unceremoniously abandoned as a child and having to cope that she transforms into an ugly hairy unknown creature when she feels very intense emotions. Well, her life was about to become harder when she stumbles across others of her own kind, one of which is a hot prince who happens to be her betrothed!The book starts off well enough and I quite like the author's writing style. The plot in this book is similar to The Charmer, except told from the perspective of Wiley. If so, it would have been expected that there would have been more plot, or additional twist and turns to give life to this novel. Unfortunately, this was not to be, you ocassionally had word for word replication of certain scenes in The Charmer. The major flaw in this book was that it turned out to be a unconcluded short novel and ended with a ""Read The Charmer to find out how it all ends!""WHAT?!?!?!?!You have got to be kidding me! Short story + overlap in plot + no conclusive ending?!?!?!?! Especially when this novel is $2.99, which is more expensive than the other books in the Darkland series!!

6436,"This story was just honestly silly to me.I went into this story with such huge and high hopes. I mean it is not really that often you get a really great Dragon shifter story, an erotica one at that. Well, this was yet again not one of those good ones. In the vain attempt to not make this ranty, because I honestly have no reason to rant, I got it for free so it would just perpetuate the cycle of silly to rant about this short story. Which, to be honest, I have read so many great ones recently I was bound to come across one I didn't really like that much. So in that respect I'm going to say what I liked and what I didn't like and be as respectful as I can to the author.What I liked-I like Rajah. He was a great Alpha male and he really fit into the environment and the world that was created. It was supposed to be other worldly with an old world flare. With the way he talked and his attitude he fit. The concept was honestly a great idea. If you were to run with the general idea and mould it in the proper fashion it had amazing potential. The whole idea that there are Dragon shifters and they will snatch up you're pretty virgin butt if they sniff you out is just hot. The sex was honestly rowdy and downright dirty, she didn't hold back and I liked that. The words were raunchy and I was like ""MEOW!"" I wanted to blow my own flames.What I didn't like-With that being said we get down to the basics of why this short fell short. First off, the story is named after the female lead and she was migraine inducing. Larkspur is a `dolphin' shifter and a virgin, though you could have fooled me. The girl acted offended by being pawed at for a total of 3.5 seconds before she was naked spreading her legs. Yes, I get it's a short and you have a word count you are required to work with, but did she have to talk like a girl from the Valley in Southern California? Honestly, it didn't work for me. The moment Larkspur saw his `manhood' she changed. Her dialogue became unbelievable for the old world setting and she just said the daftest things. She ruined the story for me to be honest. When you use the term ""Well you do have a yummy looking c*ck."" And then have her spread her legs out, a supposed virgin that also doesn't feel any pain when said dragon man slides into her HARD mind you HARD! Make it just a little bit believable please!!!!!Needless to say I don't think I will be running out to get her other books based on this world, though I am curious if she runs the same theme with the women that are just so horribly unappealing.  I feel that this is a rant, I'm sorry that this is a rant but I was in bed reading this at 12am just going `Really! I stayed up for this!' I think I was just far too excited about it.",negative,book
6461,"This book was definately a not good freebie.  My first thought as I was reading this book was that English was not the authors' first language.  The dialogue was sooooo stilted and then I realized it was so stilted because no one used contractions in their speaking.  We live in a world of speeding things up and contractions speed up speech....I will instead of I'll, can not instead of can't just makes the dialogue not authentic.  Considering the age and history of the H/H this book needed a faster pace.  The fact the Kip (or rather as one typo referred to him as CRIP...what a hoot) was still afraid of his mother opens up a whole can of Oedipal  issues.

6896,"That was my first thought as I read the finishing lines.The answer is easy. I am apparently easy, gullible or something like that.I'll make it easy for you with a list of what I felt was the problems with this book:It was short - that is not necessarily a bad thing, but when the author tries to cram a full length novel into too few pages and lacks skill at the same time, it is a mess.The characters were flat, as in cardboard cut-outs. I liked Vere. He would have been interesting to get to know, but sadly, we did not get to in this book. Tess was just not interesting.The sex is sad, bland and poorly written.You find yourself thinking ""What?!"" several times as Tess just accepts things. There is a great build up around Veres deception. It is one of the only places in the book where you actually feel something. And it just turns out to be nothing, Tess is just ok with it. Oh she punishes him. Or that is what the book says... I just didn't see it.And that is the main problem with this book; you feel absolutely nothing. There are no highs, no lows, you invest nothing in the characters and their story, you get no mental image of them.I have not read anything else by this author or any of her other books in this series. I don't know if the other books are longer or better written. I just know that this book felt like the author had a beginning and an end, but nothing in between. It felt like she herself invested nothing in her characters, did not enjoy writing them or their story.",negative,book

The ending was so abrupt as to be very surprising.  It just stopped leaving the reader to wonder if the publisher had omitted a couple of chapters. Character development of the principals was barely satisfactory, and the others were just cardboard characters at best. As the story moved to its climax, it seemed that the author wanted to get it over with, and some really important developments to the story were dealt with summarily and without any real substance.  This of course led to greater implausibility.

After uploading it I noticed it opened near the end of the book--that was my first clue that not all was well. But I went to the beginning and started reading. The opening is so much like scenes of one of the Alien movies, the one with the marines, that I found it irritating and quickly read to try to find where the plot began. After awhile I started to recognize a few of the characters and realized I had tried to read this book before and gave up. That is why it opened near the end--I had skipped to the end before to see if the story was worth reading. AND IT ISN'T! No wonder I had forgotten the book--it has nothing memorable about it. Macho space marines-Aliens, space settlers on a mining colony revolting against the owners-Total Recall, endless dry discussion of futuristic military equipment-any Tom Clancy book, but add No Plot and it is just words.

I don't mind when writers put graphic sex scenes into books; but I would prefer them to not be within the first 2 pages of the book, and have disgusting orgy scenes.  What little of the book I actually was able to finish had 9 pages of sex to 1 page of actual plotline. This book is also extremely short for the money you spend on it (not that I made it through the book but could have easily finished it in an hour). If you actually enjoy reading novels that have a plot and are well written, do not buy this one.",negative,book

7215,"I am revising my review DOWN to one star, based on this author's responses to negative reviews, including mine. First he says he's not getting into ""a pissing contest"" with me, yet he had no trouble doing so with three or four other one-star reviewers (which he conveniently disremembers)...excuse me, one exception: He sicced his ""professional editor"" Sally Berneathy on Mr. Spadaro.Among one-star comments: ""reminded me of Nancy Drew...could have been written by a teenage girl,"" ""silly,"" ""makes no sense,"" ""dialogue is horrible,"" ""complete boredom,"" ""story is implausible,"" ""cheap and nasty,"" ""absolutely appalling,"" ""one dimensional as if a 13 year old wrote this,"" ""pedestrian,"" ""a first draft that appears to merit no further effort,"" ""bad grammar, syntax, punctuation...completely unrealistic characters, pages of pointless 'cute' banter that no one who has ever actually talked to an adult would dare call realistic,"" ""the text is simple, the plot is simple, the characters are simple,"" ""Moats should have paid me,"" ""who are these people that gave it a 4 or 5 star rating...I hope they don't live in my neighborhood,"" ""...even at this price (free) this book is a ripoff...who edited this? Someone's baby brother?"", ""reads like a dropout loser's fantasy,"" ""writing is usually sophomoric, at times schoolgirl giddy, and always bad,"" ""writing style is awful. Painful even. Lifeless sentences, tired descriptions,"" and Mr. Moats calls ME ""mean"". He also points out that he has legions of followers who applaud his work: I'm happy he has a large extended family.And the final nail: ""All of this combined with the rude responses to other Amazon reviewers by the author and I'm done with this guy for good."" AMEN.""Holy crap,"" he said, then put it between covers, titled it ""Classmate Murders"" and called it a book. I'm still not giving it a one-star because it DID improve. Somewhat.Let me get this straight. An 60-year-old, twice-divorced, unemployed (by choice, having determined his EMPLOYERS to be ""stupid"" and ""jerks"") car lot security guard who lives with his parents (supposedly helping Mom after Dad suffered a stroke but in return for a few chores and errands apparently gets room and board, gratis*) takes it upon himself to stick his nose into two murder cases simply because he went to school 40-some years earlier with the victims?And on what planet would a police investigator disclose pertinent facts of an ongoing murder investigation to - again, a 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - AND cautions this uninvolved third party not to reveal said facts to the press? AND quick-as-a-bunny deem him an ""unofficial civilian advisor""?And the first thing said - again, 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - uninvolved third party does is spill his guts about the murder (by now plural) and the ""closely police-guarded/ongoing investigation"" facts to his best friend, also - you guessed it - a (concealed-weapon licensed) automobile car lot security guard.Another sticking point: A smart, attractive, sexy 60-year-old semi-celebrity woman may have become reunited with a former boyfriend after 40-some years for some slap-and-tickle, but believe me - NO woman in such a position and still in possession of her mental faculties would completely ignore the fact that the former boyfriend - in 40-some years - had no higher achievement or aspiration than to become a - again - 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents.That's not suspending your disbelief, it's taking it out into a dark alley and shooting it point-blank through the forehead. That would have been more of a mercy killing than having, at long last, come to the end of ""Classmate Murders"".After reading 19% I had to go back and start over again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Tragically, I wasn't.On a positive note, a little further on the plot does get considerably more interesting. Whether it's interesting enough to overcome its unfortunate beginning and the foul taste left in my mouth from this unfortunate choice of protagonist ""attributes"" is up to the reader to decide.About the only thing I could recommend this book for would be as a classic study in character history and personality traits NOT to give your protagonist. Okay, he's a good guy, has a sense of right and wrong, is kind to his parents and hasn't kicked any dogs by the end of the book. Beyond that, as a general rule I don't require that a book's plot be 100% ""believable"" or even a remote semblance of real life. Still and all, THIS one was completely out of the realm of even MY sense of plausibility.To give Mr. Moats the benefit of the doubt I did read the excerpt from the next book in the series, ""Vegas Show Girl Murders,"" and while it might appear at first blush to be an improvement on 'Classmate', my sense is that the character hurdles enumerated at the beginning of this review are going to be difficult to bury. Still and all - as long as I can get ""Vegas"" for free - I will probably give it a try and hope for better things. For everybody.For those keeping score, here are the standings as far as heads-ups for most reviewers' declared turnoffs:1.) Profanity is present but not excessive;2.) No paranormal, supernatural, sci-fi, or magic components;3.) Little, non-gooey, romance;4.) No graphic sex (note the protagonist, ""has occasional sexual encounters, just not with another human being."");5.) Incest between half-sibs is mentioned;6.) No religious or alternative lifestyle agenda or promotion;7.) Some violence of a low-gory (but not grisly) nature, one non-gory incident of torture;8.) No cliffhanger ending;9.) Grammar and punctuation police, have at it, examples of what you will find:""She carefully taped the ends together and produced a nice spark."" (tape-ing would have produced noth-ing, tapping would have been more productive)""My curiosity was peaked.""""...but no one seems knows where.""*after all, the protagonist does confess to having split the money his MOM gave him for gas (for HIS car which is used primarily for HIS job) between the car's needs and his own need for BEER",negative,book

7323,"Let me start off by saying that I love paranormal romances. Sadly, however I did not have the same experience as the other reviewer- I only read up to 4 chapters. I was very intrigued by the plot... Plot sounded very original which prompted me to download the book. The first few pages started off fine then it went downhill.  For me I get really annoyed when characters, with no backstory instantly speak of love and strong intense passion.  Within the first 3 chapters, the protagonist has visions, instantly those visions of a man turns into reality, and that reality is that this handsome and alluring man is a vampire. During this meeting she is overwhelmingly torn between love/lust and suspicion. This vampire instantly takes her to a library/bookstore and gives her books on vampire lore so I am assuming they can solidify their budding relationship. While reading the books they speak all this drivel about how he is a good man and its not his fault he's a vampire and she will love him anyway- Really?  After an hour?  I admit that I could have given this story more of a chance but I also did not like her writing style. So I threw in the proverbial towel...The book just was not for me, definitely other paranormal romances with more depth, character development and believable romance.",negative,book
7354,"****Spoiler alert**** I don't really give things away, but some might consider what I say spoilers, so fair warning. I was looking forward to this book mainly because I usually love Maya Banks's style. But I found myself having to push through parts of the story. The plot sounded good, different, and it was. However, there was no real angst. The story, by design, starts out in the middle of the relationship. She does explain what led up to this point, however, the men never show their &#34;alpha-ness&#34; in any true sense and she just capitulates to them way to easily. None of them seem to have any friends or family as well. If she was so unhappy and lonely, why didn't she talk to them? Why is it only the three of them? The only other character mentioned is the men's personal assistant who seems to be on her side. But she doesn't confide in her either. Also, it is mentioned in the very beginning that one of the characters may not be happy with the arrangement and that line is quickly dropped, never to be mentioned again. I normally would highly recommend anything by this author but I don't feel I can with this one. It seems to be lacking something that usually makes Maya's books quick reads.",negative,book

I think if Bevill had spent more time developing the story and exploring the characters this could have been a pretty good read, but as is...it's just a rushed romance with a side of whimsy. In fact it's mostly romance after the two main characters meet, and some of it just came off as ""I'm confessing my love the second I meet you to progress the storyline quickly.""It's okay if you are looking for a short read and nothing deep but don't go into expecting too much.

Further, there are very poor relationships between not only these two characters but also the other characters in teh story.  the wife is non existent.  the daughter is a monster.. there are no friendships... the second character follows the 'prince' apparently out of fear and a hope... that he will eventually get to fixing their lands main problem... very very dark dreary stuff here... bodies dead and alive and re awakened from the dead and re killed all over the place.... if I was a person in this land I would leave there as soon as possible and fight on the other side....these people are not rationally motivated... none of them",negative,book

7610,"(I would give this story a 2.5 stars and not 2 if I could)To start, I'll give some background on the story. Undergrad Freshman Jada Mae Channinng and Grad Student Aaron McKensie starts a strong friendship while attending Harvard and volunteering at a local community center. On the last day of the fall semester, the two can't deny the lust that's been mingling between then for months and finally gives in. The two continues their friendship through the months ahead but with Aaron working for his father's company in Europe and Jada working here way through school, the two lose contact.Four years later in Atlanta at a dinner party, Aaron and Jada reconnect on terms that aren't so well inviting. Much has changed in four years. Aaron who is often cited in the ""Wall Street Journal"" is now branching out his business in Atlanta to work closely with NFL team the Atlanta Falcons, is his own multi-millionaire and is in another relationship. Jada is now working her way through Graduate school to become an Educator while holding down two jobs. And oh yeah, she's the mother of Aaron four year old son, Joshua.Determined to make up for lost time with his ""new"" family, Aaron does everything in his power to show Jada he's in love with her and wants to be apart of his son's life. But as it may, coming from two families with very different backgrounds is holding them back from what they both want, or at least it's holding back Jada. Aaron's father, Alexander is unwilling to accept that fact that Aaron is not only a father but is in love with a lower-middle class African American women. Jada Mae's grandmother Candace is reluctant about Aaron because of her own prejudices against White men.But Aaron is willing to walk away from everything including his father, current girlfriend and the company to be with Jada and Aaron exclusively and it's up to him to prove just that to Jada.My personal take:I've read 3 other stories by Savannah J Frierson, and of the 4, this one was the most disappointing. I felt like I've read this story several times from other authors. It was kinda ""cliche-ish"" to me which was what disappointed me the most. I can't say this was a romance novel because there wasn't many romantic moments in the story. There was one intimate scene and I felt like it was severely rushed. SEVERELY rushed!The character development could have been better. There was one instance where Jada was called ""fat"" by a counterpart yet, no where in the story was her size ever mentioned until after this incident took place besides when it was mentioned how short she was compared to Aaron who also wasn't described very well. The character Jada came across being extremely whinny and her best friend Deshae was highly nosy! I felt like Deshae fit this stereotypical African American women too well and that bother me to know end. Actually, it got on my nerve to say the least.What I did like about the story was how well their son Joshua was incorporated.He seemed like an adorable kid.I won't say you shouldn't read this book because we all have different tastes, but if you've read previous work by Savannah, you might not like this story as much as say, ""Trolling Nights"", which is the best books I've ever read. I had certain expectation from Savanna after reading other books from her and this one fell extremely short of those expectations. I was just overall disappointed.",negative,book

Jinn is a Reah,  some genetically gifted shifter who makes the entire tribe better,  but every other Reah has been a woman,  how can we explain a male, gay one?

It is hard to describe without using the words pulp fiction. Which has come to mean something else. I see this style as belonging on supermarket shelves - mass fiction which needs no thought. And then the story. It is a good premise, the kind of is he isn't he . Childhood memories that are missing and therefore our killer could be our author. Even he does not know. I worked it out half way through. I lost patience then with our hero's stupidity and interest along with it.

8104,"I enjoyed the first 1/3 of this book.  The story was engaging and I am always hopeful that I'll find a really great thriller in the same vein as Tom Clancy. (a person can dream, can't they?)I was especially pleased when an early scenario came to a satisfying, timely resolution.  I looked forward to enjoying the rest of a fast paced read.Sadly, this wasn't meant to be.  The last 2/3 of the book could have been told in half the time.  The story started to drag and meander.  The reader can see where the book is going, but it takes such a long, round-about way to get there that I found myself skimming trying to get to the inevitable conclusion.Two other negative points were: 1) It was difficult to get in the government's corner over the root issue.  Without giving anything away, I could definitely see the terrorist's point when it came to their outrage against the U.S.2) The suspense of this book took a hit when it became apparent that the only truly 'together' group in this tale was the mafia portion.  Neither the government agencies nor the terrorist group were very bright or formidable.  Some of the passages were truly cringe worthy.A HUGE turn off for me was the inclusion of a romantic twist.  I absolutely HATE that.  I would love to find a well written mystery/ thriller that does not pander to the unnecessary tendency to include a love story.To me, nothing weakens a thriller like having some soppy mess thrown in just to satisfy...what?  I don't even know.  It's completely ridiculous.  In this tale you have agents navigating the woods in search of a terrorist stronghold.  These are supposedly the 'best of the best' and the situation is of dire national importance.  So what does the author do?  He throws in romantic schlock so that two of the agents can become distracted and waste the reader's time with idiotic inner musings.  The middle of a life and death situation is not the time for that crap.  It's a cheap device and I abhor authors who employ it.Along that same vein, I quickly became tired of the protagonist's wife whining about his job and its effect on their marriage.  She knew it going in, but takes every opportunity to make him feel guilty...even in the midst of a terrible national crisis.Perhaps the subsequent books in this series are better.  This one, however, seems disjointed and covers too much ground to be plausible or enjoyable.I would hesitate to read another book in this series because this one was so difficult to slog through until the end.",negative,book

He was considered beneath her wealthy status, and not in her class.  As he grew up, anyone he dated was contrasted against his dream, but everyone paled in comparison to her.  Now that Dean is all grown up leaving his bad boy image behind, he finds out she is moving back to town.Veronica is moving back to her childhood hometown to break the hold her family has had over her life to start again.  She also wants to be in a locale where no one knew her husband that died in the line of duty.  Her goals were to open her new business, and to find someone to have a no strings hot affair with.  When she saw the fire department captain was none other than childhood crush Dean, she set out to seduce him.This was a moderately entertaining read, but I found the character Veronica to be very shallow and irritating.  I understand the need to be your own person, but she wanted different things out of life than Dean did.  She wanted instant gratification and had no interest in long term.  Any time Dean tried to have a serious discussion; she would distract him with sex.  The only thing important was what she wanted.",negative,book

This animal cruelty trend is very ugly and not needed.  I hope the author stops the animal cruelty and killing in her books or I shall stop reading everything by her.This book is nice in that it has her back at her own business and working with her brother again. Rusty is her companion again.  This is all good and a well-needed change from the last book.Her husband is pouting because after crashing and almost being killed in a helicopter in the last book, she doesn't jump up and fly for him everytime he needs her to.  Flying is his passion, not hers, but he's being a baby about it.

8721,"As an avid lover of fairytales revamped for adults, I literally devoured ""Mrs. Beast"" in one sitting. I began reading it around 10p.m. and I stayed up until about 2 a.m. It was that good. I loved how Elora had her finger in every fairytale ""pie"" and her interactions with her poor, mistreated mutt.The sequel starts out strong, but as soon as the protagonist, Rune (the daughter of Beauty and the Beast) goes on a quest to find the Hedgehog turned Prince that she is infatuated with, the story rapidly begins to lose steam. I think the problem is Ms. Ditchoff used and elaborated on the backstory of so many better known, more interesting fairytale characters all the well known, more interesting fairytale heroines in her first book, leaving her to really scrape for more to use in this one and the characters are, for lack of a better word, lame and completely one-dimensional. Or perhaps she was rushed when she wrote the sequel and was not able to take the same amount of time and care she put into the first to really expand upon her characters.I found myself unable to connect or really care about Rune or all the characters in the story the way I did when I read Mrs. Beast. Plus, the characters who share their tales are so unfamilar to me, that I felt kind of lost and my interest wanned.For example, Rune meets the Bog King's daughter who takes FOREVER to tell her boring story which could have been summed up in a paragraph. Basically this is her backstory: Mom is raped by the Bog King, daughter is born and turns into a 80lb frog each night(sounds like Fiona from Shrek...). Priest comes to village, then Bog daughter escapes to Egypt with Mom, turns back into a princess, then goes to Heaven with the Priest, returns to earth and finds that 100 years have passed, so now she is a bolt of lightening for all eternity that works for Elora. Um...yeah...okay...Elora is a lot more subdued in the story and her interactions with her mutt don't sizzle with the same humor and irony. I forced myself to continue reading, but it was unenjoyable and a big let down.Because of the strength of Mrs. Beast, I would be willing to give a third book by Ms. Ditchoff a try, but if it dissapoints me as much as Princess Beast, then I won't be purchasing anymore.",negative,book

I could've had a my favorite sub and a bag of chips with that six dollars. I'm scratching this author off my list. This book was chocked full of sex, heat, more sex, domineering alpha-male werewolves, and a weak whiny human woman. Oh and more sex. The dialogue was 'off'. That's the best word to describe it because the conversation between the whiny chick and her werewolf was disconnected at times. He would say something, and she would respond to something else. And another thing that irritated me. SHe was always ""fighting back tears"". Ugh, really. So weak and pathetic. I can not stand weak women characters.

8846,"Everyone knows I have a huge hero complex. There are times I want my female strong and there are times I want her knight in shining armor to come charging in to save her. Depends on the books and certainly depends on the characters. A Wicked Wolf got off to a slow start for me  story wise. I did throughly enjoy all the sex, and there was a ton of if being an erotic novel. But I found the story line to be slightly lacking. First and foremost the main character comes off as what Lafayette from True Blood might call a HOOKAH. The first scene involves Randi taking matters into her own hands while driving up a dirt road into the mountains. She seems completely surprised that her exploits cause her to miss that deer jumping into the road and wrecking her car into a ditch. Well how is one supposed to engage in that, while thinking about all the random men she wants to hook up with AND keep her eyes on the road?When she meets her savior, J.R who is really Nick, the man she supposed to be closing a major land development deal with, she is instantaneously turned on. Seems she is in her breeding cycle and JR, a Lycan, can't keep his hands off her. Every time they come up for air they are quickly sucked back into the tiring sexual exploits again. Very Kinky exploits I might add...they were WOW.  Since JR is withholding the information that he is indeed a werewolf, there is a lot of exploits with Randi facing away from him...if you catch my drift. This all happened by chapter two which is the norm for a erotic romance, however with this particular book I wasn't in any way connected to the characters yet.One thing at this point catches my attention. Randi has two teenage siblings at home depending on her closing this land deal to better their lives and send them to college. And yet she has no regard for being gone for almost an entire week with no contact with them. WHAT? Either she doesn't care very much, or they are way to used to her running off with random strange men. She makes a point to think about the fact that she has disappeared for several days at a time with no word to them before. Honestly, I think the brother and sister should have been just left out of the story, because their existence make Randi come off as a sex crazed starlet who doesn't care about her actions as long as she is satisfied.I did love that Randi was so completely trusting of JR when she found out what he was. Yes, there is the initial balking in terror, but his sensual touch is just so hot she needs to succumb to him anyway. The first time they make love facing each other is much sweeter than the rest of their animalistic couplings you expect with a shapeshifter romance.What I wanted more of was the mystery surrounding JR's (aka Nick) murdered wife. I wanted more *ahem* action...However that whole side story line doesn't unravel until near the end and is over quite quickly. I wanted more ongoing threat to Randi, more wolf form for Nick and more storyline. I really did not mind all the sex, in fact Brenda does an AWESOME job of writing those scenes. BUT I would have liked more story line, even if it made the book longer.So while the sex scenes were really well wrote and totally engaging, it's not enough for me to love this book. I liked it.

Though I think current TV is dire, this would really kill it for may of us who want programmes designed for those who think and use imagination and don't need to be spoon fed :)Still, the book. Well, as I said I thought this would be fun. A bit of sexy, spicy, erotica wrapped up in an interesting story. Sadly I was wrong, and what this consists of in my opinion is simply page after page after page of sex, self pleasure, with a partner or with multiple partners, with a flimsy, feeble story as an excuse for carrying it. The plot is thin, really poorly put together, (for instance landlords of commercial properties don't call round for a cheque days after a rent rise...it's all BACS transactions..) with the sex part being so repetitive its actually a turn off.

Aside main romance however there were about four or five other romances going on between other characters. Normally I like a little background romance besides the main attractions, but in regards to this book the background caused more of a distraction. Just when it felt like the story was getting more into Luke and Juliet's romance it would skip to someone else's and cause confusion. And killing off one of my favorite characters (whose own romance I would have liked to have seen turn happily-ever-after) just killed the whole book for me.",negative,book
9584,"This is the story of a detective and his new partner encountering a murder case.  The case becomes something much more than solving a basic murder when details come to light regarding people related to murder victim.  And it becomes an issue of solving more than one case and adding assistance from FBI and Navy.  The premise, while not a new one, has merit.  The specifics are predictible in some parts and there are no real twists to getting to the ""who done it"" and why.  However, that does not mean that many will not enjoy this version.  For many will.  Fans of true suspense crime novels won't find real depth found in other noted authors of same genre (Robb, Grafton, Etc.) - but is a fairly good attempt.The issues lie with presentation (style) moreso than premise.  The novella is riddled with errors related to grammar, punctuation, character development and presence, Point of View, and story arc development.Punctuation:  overuse of exhuberance (!) where illfiting at times, extra floating dialogue quotes at end of paragraph without dialogue, other than dialogue bits (some, not all) incorrectly punctuated, some dialogue missing punctuation related to tags, missing or incorrect punctuation.  Dialogue paragraphs with same speaker punctuated incorrectly (though very few will know such.)Formatting is still a bit of an issue as there are some pages where paragraph breaks are so many only two small paragraphs fit on page.  I do not include format issues in star rating as I know that (at times) formatting is amazon conversion issue from downloaning - rather than writer issue.  However, it appears as if the manuscript was originally typed double spaced and when hitting double return between paragraph breaks (which would then be 4 lines, rather than customary 2) there was an overabundance of spaces.  If that is case a simple full document conversion to single spacing prior to downloading should clear up format issues like that.Grammar:  wrong words used - corn rolls (should be rows) to describe ME hair, make on (should be one) take - there are several such errors - but you get the idea on that.  Past tense and present tense switches in sentences and paragraphs was frequent.  Some may be stylistic choice of writer and happens - but not with such frequency as seen in the work.  Some subject/verbs were not grammatically correct - plural nouns get plural verbs,  etc.POV:  I origionally was going to forgive the first few POV switches as character related fleshing.  But, when the POV for many of the characters switched between third person and first person (in same paragraph) I realized it was author error, NOT character voice.  It is possible to have a character think to self in first while rest of tale told in third - but only if the writer understands the fine line and can convey properly.  In this installment of series (in author defense this is first in series and she may have worked this issue out in later works) the author has no grasp of what POV she is using and how to use properly.  One POV is best for the whole work until such time as skill is developed well enough that conveyance and reading are not stilted for reader.Character issues:  Trace was intergral character and partner in training,  then he just (all but) disappeared about half way through book in order for the ""love"" plot device to develop.  Bob was FBI partner that was there for a blink, disappeared for the same reason as Trace, then popped in near end without adding ANYTHING to storyline.  It would have served better to leave Bob out and just send 1 FBI agent to work case as Bob did nothing but add an inconsistency to story line (detail on that next) .  Press was well developed and Trace fairly so (even though underused)  as was female agent.Inconsistencies:Chapter 11 - Press and Trace left interview with Moira - they climbed in the beater car and drove away...fine, until the reader turns the page and Press puts key in ignition, turns it and gets the smoke plume.Chapter 27 - title states day 4 time:  10 AM - yet the first paragraph has press and agent arriving at house ""that evening.""Chapter 28 - title states day 5 at 9:15 AM - Bob tells Rachel he will be in that night and see her next morning.  However,  he does not show up until day 7, several chapters later.There were more issues related to each listed, but you get idea.  I apologize for length, I write long - though typically not thus much.  However, I viewed a comment by author wherein she stated that a review was not really fair to those reading it (or to her I surmise) without specifics so she could fix errors.  Though some of the word issues and punctuation are not a big deal and frequqntly missed - the gross errors (POV and story arc inconsistencies) should not require reviewer intervention for correction. They should have been caught by writer or her editor as they are glaring.As stated in beginning, many will enjoy this novella. Though predictible and even with errors it is an okay read.  If there were not so many errors, I would have awarded more stars.Christine",negative,book
9590,"The basic set up - King Henry VIII didn't die, but went secretly into exile on a remote island along with William, a son he sired off of some maid or other. Seventeen years pass and then Henry decides to return to England and put William on the throne (!!!), but first there's this little problem of his daughter Elizabeth being queen and all...I'll not spoil, but what follows is some of the most preposterous nonsense I've come across since the incredibly direHeir Apparent, although at least that one was bad enough that it was actually funny. This is not. As some other reviewers have already noted this book is heavy on dialog (some rather bad), and rather light on the plot - and a very silly plot it is.

It's difficult to believe that a couple could reach this stage of their relationship without being able to communicate better.  Based on this story, I would guess this marriage won't last for long.Did she not realize she married a macho guy who insisted on always having things his way?  Did he not realize that she would pout when he didn't do exactly what she wanted?  They aren't even on the same page as to what kind of physical relationship they want to have.

9756,"From what I understand, this is Mari Carr's first published piece and frankly, it kind of reads that way. I liked the two main characters and enjoyed their connection, plus there were some places with decent chemistry and sizzle. Overall though, it all felt very inconsistent. At some points Ross seems very alpha, at others we're told he's alpha but really see no evidence of that.The beginning of their sexual relationship felt a little awkward, with them running hot and cold and bouncing around back and forth on what they understand their relationship to be. The whole thing felt choppy, the love scenes short, jumping from one to another, then skipping a few days, etc. There were only a few lines in each scene that started to make me feel hot and bothered, and then it would sizzle away. It sometimes seemed like the ingredients were there, but for some reason they didn't come together as they should and it ended up feeling ... flat.One *HUGE* complaint I have: They start off almost at the beginning with role-playing - and role-playing in which Julia is a captive or sex slave, i.e. she's supposed to be somewhat resisting. While resistance is not a big part of the role-playing, it's still present, so I found it extremely disturbing that there was no safe word and they didn't lay down any rules or understandings beforehand.As I said before, I liked Julia and Ross and really enjoyed their friendship and the dialogue back-and-forth between them. I think the story could have turned out far better if that part had been more heavily explored and the sexual component of their relationship slowly integrated in. A really fantastic example of this that I read recently was Claire Matthews'Intimate Friends. That novella is even shorter, so the length constraint is greater and they start sleeping together pretty early on, however it felt much smoother and worked far better than in this case.ROMANCE NOVELLA RECOMMENDATIONS:*Intimate Friendsby Claire Matthews (4.5 stars)*Hearts In Darknessby Laura Kaye (4.5 stars)*Willing Victimby Cara McKenna (4 stars)",negative,book

Knowing the power of their sexual heat, Wynn brings home a book on sex magick that will allow the two of them to harness their sexual energy and use it to cast spells.Sounds great doesn't it?Sadly, the story isn't much longer than what I just wrote. It was a ten minute read. Definately a short story. Don't expect a novella. There just isn't enough there to justify my time or the two bucks. Heck, for five bucks I can have a three hundred page novel.So, maybe you are just in the mood for a good, sexy read. Not so much. Yep. They have sex.

Maybe a little experimentation out of the box?? Heck we are talking pagans here right? Pagans that have been together for 5 years.More than anything I felt like it was an education on magic and casting.

It's about a huge secret--finding out you had a child with a woman you don't know or don't remember--and trying to figure out how to deal with the consequences and rewards of learning this unsuspected news. Yet, once the &#34;cat is out of the bag&#34; the mother (Kate) finds that having her life on display in the tabloids starts bringing in some scary pranks that put her and her son's lives on the line. Will they be able to keep everyone safe while finding out the truth about what really happened?This is a captivating novel in the way that no matter how much it dragged on for me I was interested in how it would end and what would happen between Kate, Lane, & their son. Together Kate & Lane just worked, especially when everything seemed to be going against them.If I didn't feel like I had to push through this novel because of it dragging for me, then I would have given this a better rating. As I enjoyed the main characters & their friends, while the &#34;enemy&#34; always seemed to change for me. I kept trying to guess who the person doing the &#34;pranks&#34; was and--even though I wasn't completely surprised about who it was--I was shocked by the extremes she went through.Nevertheless, I will admit not to enjoying how the reveal of Kate's son's paternity played out. For me ... if Lane didn't go from finding out (at the end of the novel) the real truth of things, then (in a way) acting like he was saying &#34;oh yeah, now I remember and I did really like/love her,&#34; then running away from Kate, and then the following day try to make amends (in a big way) with no real explanation ...

10297,"I have no idea how a book that had such a promising premise and a great set up derailed so incredibly for me as I was reading. And 'derailed' is a good term because I felt like I was 'reading' a slo-mo trainwreck. That sounds hyperbolic and I don't mean it to be. But the story just started to unravel in so many ways for me that until the end I did not like, in any way, a single character in this book.Now, I have read a few of Marie Force's books. Some I've really liked and some that didn't work for me in small ways, but not to an extent that I've actively disliked them. I do enjoy her writing because I think she writes messy stories. By that I mean, she doesn't always color within the lines in a genre that sometimes feel it is one formula after the other. I respect that. But this book simply can't be put in the win column for me.**********SPOILERS GALORE********************THIS REVIEW IS ONE BIG SPOILER************************************First I have to say that every character in the book succumbed to one of two ailments: Big A$$ Whiny Baby syndrome (BAWBS) or Super Self Righteousness-itis (SSR). Not one person remained immune.As I mentioned above the set up and premise is really a good one. Ted Duffy is a pediatric oncologist who comes from a super awesome family and has four of the best friends ever. The guys, Ted, Parker, Smitty and Chip, have all grown up together and have known each other forever. They have a summer house they share and one weekend Smitty brings Caroline, a woman he had been dating for only a few weeks. When Ted and Caroline meet they fall instantly in love. For Ted, Caroline is THE ONE. And he's heartsick that she is Smitty's girl. For Caroline Ted also brought the lightning bolt of love. They part determined to let time and distance remove temptation.I have no issues with love at first sight. I am a believer that people can connect quickly and for real, but honestly I wasn't sold on it here. I thought them both simply saying 'She's the one' and 'he's the one' was too simple. I didn't see it, I was told it. But that is ok. The premise is that they fall in love quickly in order to make it worthwhile when they have to break it to Smitty that they are in love.The second time they meet there is no denying anything and they resolve to be together and work through the pain they must cause everyone. For her part, Caroline plans to break up with Smitty and she and Ted plan to tell him about their attraction. So far so good.But of course things don't work out that way. Smitty overhears them talking and figures out what is going on. And this is where the story begins to run off the rails for me and where Smitty becomes the first to succumb to BAWBS. So he realizes that his girlfriend of 6-weeks and his best friend of 20 years have a thing for each other. Does he confront them? Ask them about it? regroup to think and talk it over with the other friends? No he starts playing childish head games to torture them. And then he picks up his toys and runs to Australia while everyone is so worried about what is going on with Poor Smitty. Never mind that he and Caroline had only been casually dating and that he knew she wasn't as into him as he was to her. No, all this becomes as dramatic as a  Chinese Opera.So now that Caroline and Smitty are done she and Ted are free to pursue each other. They plan to tell the other friends that they are now dating but it doesn't work out quite that way. The other friends find out by accident. And this is where the other guys start to succumb to SSR. How could Ted do this to Smitty? He is ruining 20 years of friendship...blah blah blah.But Ted and Caroline stay strong and are so in love. So in love in fact that within 3-weeks of being together they get married. At this point the train jumps the tracks. Everybody is so outraged that it is almost comical. Even Ted's mother who had been so concerned about her only son's long hours in a high stress job and his lack of personal life doesn't take a moment to think 'hmm, maybe I should get to know this girl who has been the only person my son has shown any real interest in in years' but rather 'how dare you cheat on your best friend with that cheating bitch who is a cheating bitch!!!'So this goes on for some time with everyone giving them the cold shoulder, none of the friends coming to their more formal wedding (they had been married by a justice of the peace earlier). Mind you, no one seems at all concerned about Ted's state of mind, marrying a woman he barely knows, or wondering if she's a gold-digger or anything like that. No everyone is more concerned about how this will all affect poor Smitty. Sure, Ted can be construed a terrible friend for jumping into a relationship with his best friend's ex, but they are all just as terrible for not even trying to understand why he did this. No they are content to just wallow in their SSR.At this point I am rooting hard for Ted and Caroline because, really, everyone else around them are just being jerks. In a real life situation like this, amongst a group of friends, people would be taking sides or some would be neutral not wanting to choose one friend over the other. Some would even be happy for Ted and telling Smitty to suck it up. It's not like Smitty and Caroline were married and she and Ted were sneaking around behind his back. The level of outrage simply didn't fit the perceived crime, imo.So remember how I said I was rooting for Ted and Caroline at this point. Well, that is true until Ted succumbs to BAWBS. After all the 'I love you, no I love you more' and them telling each other it was worth the scorn of family and friends to be together and they pinky swear to stand just the two of them against the world...what does Ted do? Well he decides it is just too hard to live without all his friends around. He can't take their abandonment and censure. So he deserts his wife. Yup. He leaves her. Oh, he still loves her just can't be around her because she was the reason it all went south with his friends and family. So he takes a new job in a whole other state and stops wearing his wedding ring. My reaction at these developments was 'Are you kidding me!?!?' And here the train falls off the tracks completely, down a mountainside.At this point, Caroline is the only one who is still worth anything. I'll give Ms. Force credit, she makes Caroline dig in and try to fight for her marriage. For her this was the real deal and I have to say I felt it and I felt for her.But by now I was so over every single person in this book that the only reason i didn't just close it and get on with my life is because it was so late in the story.The kicker for me is that, guess what? Smitty finds his own true love in Australia and comes back all forgiving. Everything is a-ok now that he knows what love is. We call all be friends again! So now that Ted is back in the fold, he can come back to his wife because they have been formally given the blessing of Smitty. Well isn't that special!I was really hoping that Caroline would tell Ted to just F#&@ off! and then leave him to his precious friends. But she doesn't because she's so happy to have him back and tears up when he puts back on his wedding ring. Aw[...] Not!This book made me ragey. I can't recommend at all.",negative,book

I'm going to do my best not to include any spoilers, but I'm definitely going to be referencing some stuff that happens later in the book because I could see where things were headed by the time I was halfway through the book.For the first third of the book we have this AWESOME chemistry between Rori and Jude and then I get to cheer for her because she refuses to be treated like a piece of meat, the way Jude normally treats his women.  Seriously, what's with these other chicks that they're totally okay jumping him that afternoon and then seeing him out on a date with Rori that evening and then go so far as to proposition him in front of her?  Although at least that gave Rori the heads up that no matter how hot Jude is in bed, she deserves a better MAN outside of it.Enter Zach... hurrah!  Rori's biggest sexy time connection with Jude was that she discovered she's submissive and she was really turned on by his dominant side.  Zach is yet another sexy dominant who is smitten with Rori, but Zach has no problem being an amazing, romancing relationship guy.  I totally started to fall for him and then I remembered that this book is called ""Second Chances"" and that the blurb mostly talks about Jude.At which point I start going oh eff no, because Zach is too possessive for this to be a sharing book.Suffice to say, figuring out halfway through the book exactly how Jude was going to be positioned to get a second chance, and then having his second chance with Rori being RUSHED through the last third of the book, I did not come away satisfied.  There's not enough time spent on Jude's reformation and there's not enough connection between him and Rori to satisfy me.  I felt the strongest connection with Zach and yet we already know before reading that that relationship isn't ultimately going anywhere, which makes it really hard to get invested in it.By the time I got to the last third of the book I was really emotionally detached from everything that was going on because I couldn't connect with Zach anymore and I didn't want to connect again with Jude, who had been such an a$$ throughout 2/3 of the book.Dane's written much better stuff.

10663,"A previous reviewer gave a good synopsis, but his rating was far too high. Calvin, does indeed ""deduce"" that Brock is ""deeply closeted"" but nothing Brock does actually supports that conclusion. He's out to his ex-wife, his son, and doesn't bother to hide the relationship much at all. At the very beginning of the novel, Brock comes out to Calvin's property to give him an estimate on some repair work. Afterwards, Brock goes to a local bar and gets drunk, and inexplicably, Calvin is called to come drive Brock home when he gets too wasted. He directs several gay slurs at Calvin, but then comes back to Calvin's house and sleeps in the same bed with him! Moreover, he and Calvin literally jump into a relationship with no real development at all. Within a week, Calvin and Brock have not only professed their love for one another, but Calvin's given Brock huge amounts of money to solve his financial problems.As for the sex scenes, I commend Mr. Hunt because while Brock has ""sexy muscles"", he also has a ""paunch"" and in general, neither character is supposed to be a stud.A major ""con"" in this book is this: after several of the sex scenes, Brock and Calvin fart in front of one another, and then make comments like, ""Well, shouldn't have eaten the refried beans"" or ""I've just had a telephone pole up my ass"".

However,Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work, this is mostly a book of action, not intricate plot development. In fact, the story ends with an exciting twist, but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love, or included a really interesting plot twist.

10896,"The predominant issue with this book is the editing.  Just about every sentence is a run-on sentence.  I tried to ignore them, but reading them is the literary equivalent of tumbling down a hill.  On one page, the average sentence was five or six lines long -- all joined together with commas and very difficult to follow comfortably.Putting aside the editing issue (which I know the author is aware of, but hasn't yet fixed), the novel would be 2.5 or 3 stars.  The basic premise of the book -- retired police chief from Wisconsin helps solve mysteries in Palm Springs -- isn't bad, but the actual mechanics of it leave some questions.  I need more back story to help me understand why a small town police chief would have the ability to be especially good at solving these mysteries (the story of him just being a ""natural"" at profiling and even doing freelance profiling for the F.B.I. didn't ring true).  We never really saw Henry being good at figuring things out or having special insight into people.  He just sort of talks to people and the mystery solves itself.  It was kind of like watching your grandpa solve a case -- not a detective grandpa, but just your regular grandpa.I also had lingering questions about the plot.  The device of the autographed pictures didn't make sense.  I don't understand why somebody would be more likely to buy a house if there was an autographed picture of a celebrity in it . . . either you're an easy mark for that sort of scam or you aren't.  What was the picture supposed to convey -- that the celebrity had left an autographed picture of themselves before moving out?  It also didn't make sense that nobody on the police force wanted to solve the crime because they'd heard rumors that the victim liked to have sex with teenage boys.  Detectives can't just opt out of murder investigations -- they may do a halfway job, but they can't just call in a local volunteer.I give the author credit for attempting to create some characters that add life to the book.  Wayne and Henry were too alike to be distinguishable -- they need to be able to play off of each other better if this is going to be a successful series.  Charles was actually an good character and I can see the potential there.  It was jarring to have him continually introduce himself with ""Heeey,"" when no other dialogue had any sort of spelling alteration to imply dialect.  It was distracting and unnecessary.  The character of Amit was interesting in that you could see the author's attempt to surround Henry with characters who were very different -- Amit was young, of a different race and nationality, technically savvy, and very different in personality.  Like the vast majority of the dialogue, Amit's didn't ring true, but with more work and development (in dialogue and character), I can see this being a solid group and am hoping maybe Amit is being set up as a regular character.This has the potential to be a good series.  It isn't there yet, but I would check out future books if I felt the author addressed the editing, tightened plots, and focused on characterization.  I think there is room in the mystery world for a detective like Henry.",negative,book

10980,"First off, this is not a shape-shifter story, which I expected from the cheesy cover and the title.  It's a surprisingly uninspiring short story about an apparently very conflicted woman being forced into the company of the man she had walked out on the day before their wedding, many years earlier.This book was a freebie, but even at that price I'm ambivalent as to whether or not it was worth it.  The female lead character, Kasie, was unremarkable, and seemed to obsess on imaginary conflict where none existed.  The male lead, Chayton, was not much stronger.  I found it annoying that he demanded that Kasie cook and work around the cabin when he had kidnapped her and held her at his snowed-in cabin against her will. He seemed to think that her initial refusal to ""pull  her weight"" made her a brat, but it was actually her repeated complaints about her parents' trying to ""control her life"" that made her a whiny brat.Kasie's weak character was more and more annoying as the book went on, but when she finally meets up with her father after many years of estrangement, she acts almost as though her total lack of contact never happened.  If she was that annoyed over all those years about her father ""controlling her,"" she would not have been able to warm up to him or his new wife that quickly.  Basically, the author manufactured Kasie's feeling she was ""controlled"" by her parents to create some sort of tension in the story, a conflict to be overcome, but it's just too contrived to be believable.The ending was awkward, with Chayton suddenly acting entirely out of character compared to how he behaved in the prior 95% of the book, with no explanation for why he changed so dramatically from one scene to the next.  And what 26 year old woman is still a virgin, especially when she is supposedly about to marry a famous, handsome rock star, and who thinks she would prefer to just live with him instead?  The author seemed to require that Kasie remain chaste all those years away after she left Chayton and her father, however it was fine that Chayton had had ""his share of flings!""  The old double standard - reinforced by a modern day female author.  Wow.",negative,book
11000,"I've read my share of cozy mysteries, so I generally enjoy the genre.  I found this particular one to be unfulfilling, both from the standpoint of the mystery, and in its depiction of the characters.  Also, I would have appreciated it if it had been made clear in the blurb that this is Christian fiction - at least, I thought it so  since anytime the plot was starting to build up any hint of momentum, the two protagonists would stop and quote scripture at each other.  (If the Bible had copyright issues, this book would have lost pages in length.)The female protagonist earned her title of ""limp"" from me because she falls for a man based on the fact that he bears a surface resemblance to her imaginings of Lord Peter Wimsey, and she convinces herself it's a forever thing after a couple of strolls and a kiss.  There are sheltered thirteen-year-olds with more romantic sophistication than this.The male protagonist earns his ""limp"" status because he keeps proposing to the limp heroine, even after multiple rejections, yet doesn't actually do anything to present his case or win her over.  Probably this is intended to show his faithfulness and humility, but this is the kind of nice guy who finishes last in the real world.  And early on in the story, he responds to something the heroine tells him by saying ""Yes, mother.""  Not romantic.  Not sexy.  Not appealing.There are minimal formatting, spelling, or grammatical issues, but for me, in the absence of a genuinely intriguing mystery or engaging characters, this wasn't much of a redeeming feature.

11006,"No. Just no.I bought this because I found it on a list of books that contain a specific plot twist I usually enjoy, and I usually like this author's work. I couldn't even finish it though because it made me angry. I get the tendency that some authors have to fall back on the 'you're my mate, so we're instantly in love/lust' plotline, but I hated the way it was handled in this book.Neil and Ryan had spent many years as sex slaves, with the physical, mental and emotional trauma that entails.  I've seen authors handle this type of situation in a realistic, sensitive manner, but it is barely even addressed in this book before the main characters begin a physical relationship. Instead, the author would have us believe that all of that just disappeared when they met Gabe, because of the mating bond. The author had them willing and even eager to jump into bed with Gabe within 24 hours of meeting him, even though he was a large intimidating man similar to the men who held them, the men they were apparently terrified of.I consider this a cop out, using the instant love, instant trust 'mating bond' because an author is too lazy to, or incapable of actually addressing the deeper issues involved in the aftermath of abuse. I realize this is fiction, and fantasy fiction at that, but really, if you can't write about this kind of issue in anything even remotely resembling a realistic manner, then don't write about it at all.",negative,book

However, I was sadly mistaken. The story started off okay but then it went down hill from there. I didn't feel any chemistry between the two characters and I'm not talking sexually. Usually you can feel the connection between the characters before they jump into bed, but this story didn't have that. Like I said the premise of the story was a good one, girl LaCher or Cher gets accepted to Juilliard and is mistakenly assigned a guy Rene as her roommate because his name sounds like a girls name. They decide to make the best of it and remain roommates. They faced a few obstacles which eventually were resolved but by that point in the story I didn't care. I'm really mad that I spent $4.39 on this book because I was expecting so much more, I just wanted a more believable story. Instead I got a lot of fluff",negative,book

11633,"****SPOILER ALERT***No Good Deed was highly reviewed on Amazon, so I decided to give it a try for $.99.  Unfortunately, I forced myself to finish it long after I'd lost interest in a promising storyline.  Here's what bugged me:1.  The character development was weak, especially our ""hero"".  I felt more connected to the love interest than to the good guy/victim.  And if that wasn't bad enough, I knew something was askew when I even found myself liking the ""bad guy"" more than Mark, who was wishy-washy at best.2.  Too many concepts not well executed - post 9/11 conspiracy, political torture, romance, Police/CIA procedural AND a magic camera?  That's a mighty tall order and the author didn't meet the bar, IMO3.  The imprisonment/torture went on and on consuming a huge chunk of the book.  Because I hadn't fully engaged with our hero in the beginning chapters, I wasn't entirely rooting for him as I should have been.  I was a bit apathetic and I finally got tired of the author's ideological harangue.4.  The ending both dragged and was abrupt.  Seems strange, I know, but you'll have to see for yourself.5.

Where they shall journey to the mountain and cast the sphere back into the fires - well destroy it after passing some tests.

I expected this story to be as witty and interesting as Flat-Out Love, but it wasn't even in the same ball-park, which was extremely disappointing. I think three stars is fair for this book; it is well-written and an enjoyable story, but there's nothing spectacular about it and the plot was virtually non-existant.

Plus, Samhain nor the author don't warn for the out-of-the-blue rape that occurs to one of the heroes by some off-screen criminals (which did nothing to advance the plot), and seemed pointless.

Is sexy businessman Gray Lupo the answer to her problems, or just a wolf in gentleman's Armani?Who said being eaten by the big bad wolf was a bad thing?Alison Paige has taken Little Red Riding Hood and given it an erotic and amusing twist.  With a strong heroine, a hot older Hero in denial, a spunky Granny, along with a cast of enjoyable characters, Alison really delivers a fun erotic read.  The love scenes were steamy, though some may find a few elements of certain scenes not their style.The fact that the werewolves in this story were much more primal and true to a wolf's nature was refreshing.  However, having said that, I do have to bring to light a couple of cons.  One, I think the story could've lost a couple of side stories which felt like it slowed the story down.  Two, with some of the side stories and elements, there wasn't a true resolution.  Three, Gray Lupo is the Alpha, but the pack/family didn't really treat him as such.  There were times when the manipulation was a bit too much and too brash for the alpha persona Gray was supposed to epitomize.Overall, I would suggest this story as a weekend erotic read.

It's bad enough so many of my lesfic publishers put pictures of trees and hospitals on the covers and are afraid of getting too sexy... but these publishers who cater to the f/f pool of readers (mostly men, I gather) are afraid of putting butches on the cover.  Or they SERIOUSLY never look like the leads inside.  Or it looks like the cover of Penthouse.  Is there no honesty or a happy medium???  pfft.Okay.  Got that off my chest.  I like Paisley Smith but I never bothered ever reading the synopsis of this one due to the cover until I got REALLY interested in her work, lol.  Glad I did.  This is definitely one of my favorite Paisley couples.  (And no, I don't blame writers for what ends up on their covers)In this one we meet an early 20something boyish lesbian in boots and jeans....  who falls for her very mature and widowed 30something piano teacher.  Emily Granger is beautiful, wealthy, and blonde.  I love the classy way she is described and the fact that she hasn't been sexually fulfilled before.  Love an author who doesn't forget to give me a visual of her lovely legs.  Or her lovely skirt.  Or the way her hair falls about her shoulders.  I love these visuals.  Emily's femininity emanates right off the page... my favorite thing about Paisley's femmes.  They are genuinely feminine and delicate... and just passive enough to create a very delicious dynamic with a butch who knows how to take control.I can't get enough of her butch / femme couples when they are like these two.  It's what I liked about Beguiled.  And Beauty and the Butch.  Unfortunately, it's not a long story and won't take more than an hour to read at 50ish pages.  Even so, I'd of probably rated it 4 stars if the stupid drunken brother-in-law hadn't cut in on this story with the lame conflict.  The last bit of the story was... meh.  But I liked the epilogue.The sex is very hot.  I'm not sure why this butch didn't show up packing to those lustful piano lessons at LEAST once... that no-harness dildo scene just didn't cut it, Paisley.  The butch shoulda been packing!!!!. lol.  Other than that... loved the sex scenes.  Very, very sexy couple.  Loved them both.I would love to see this one as an erotic-romance novel.

Phoebe's brother is  wishy-washy, and his wife is a witch.  I cannot understand why Phoebe sticks around being everyone's favorite doormat once she turns 18 and is legally released from her brother's guardianship.There were strong female protagonists created by other authors in the same time period, so the lack of complexity in Phoebe's character cannot be completely explained by time and place.

Most of the book consisted of the main character wondering if what he was thinking and experiencing was real or was it due to his paranoid schizophrenia that had surfaced after 22 years under control.  Was someone really trying to drive him insane or was that just his paranoia?  There were some good points in the plot but not enough to make a good book.  Fortunately it was a quick read and the Kindle formatting was generally good.,neutral,book

801,"This book deals with an issue that I have never come across before in a romance novel. That is the infidelity of the heroine. Usually in romance novels, its a real turn off to find out either the hero or the heroine had strayed to 'greener pastures'. Most of the time rather than actually actually committing the act of infidelity, there is a misunderstanding between the hero and the heroine which is always later resolved in the novel. However it is not the case in the story of Katie and Cutter.In the first book of this series which I didn't read but was able to make out what happened by reading this book, Katie sleeps with Justin Cruz, now husband of Cutter's sister Dani Standifer. Although Katie was in a relationship with Cutter at that time, no matter how wrong infidelity is, Katie was feeling vulnerable and alone cos Cutter wouldn't really open up to her and give her what she needed.Katie has regretted sleeping with Justin from the moment Cutter finds out what happened between the two. Resolving never to let Katie into his life again, which is a bargain he has held till now, seeing Katie gatecrash Dani's wedding party is the last straw for Cutter. Thinking Katie had come to mourn over Justin, Cutter treats Katie like trash and takes what he has always wanted from her. Katie gives herself to Cutter thinking that she might get a second chance to work things out with him if she lets him have his way with her.These two embark on a purely sexual relationship, the consequence of which renders Katie pregnant. I felt that this story was too rushed and thus the resolving of the conflict between Katie and Cutter didn't quite give the satisfaction that I was craving as the reader. This story would have been much better and a more memorable one if the author had taken time to actually develop Katie and Cutter's characters a bit more and resolve the trust issues Cutter had with Katie in a more believable manner rather than just all of a sudden confessing that he loves Katie and wants her to be his wife.Anyhow okay for a quick read that doesn't require much thinking on the reader's part.",neutral,book

The EDUCATED main character, who attended a private secondary school and an Ivy League College, annoyed me the most. His dialogue was peppered with ""Fo'rizzy,"" ""Foshizzle,"" ""My nizzle, no diggity,"" among others. No exaggeration. Seriously, NO ONE talks like that. Unless they're impersonating Snoop Dogg on SNL. Outside of that, the setting descriptions were incredibly detailed, the police protocols were completely on point (I think one of the authors was a cop), and the story geared up for an amazing twist. Such a well-written whodunnit that it pains me to only give this three stars. But it doesn't pain me as much as reading through all that faux slang did.",neutral,book

1426,"This book is a review of the book Surfacing by Margret Atwood, although this fact is only clearly stated in the title of the book.  This book reads like it was written as a senior  thesis college project. The main character is not named, but she is referred to as &#8220;She&#8221;, and this makes, Stopping the World, difficult to follow. Toward the end we are told the narrator (of atwoods book) is nameless. This ought to have been stated toward the beginning to eliminate  confusion. Then we are told the nameless narrator is a device to pull readers into the story:&#8220;Read as living myth, Margaret Atwood's fine novel becomes the nameless narrator's service to her community, which now includes us, the thoughtful reader.&#8221;It is difficult for readers to identify with a nameless narrator, but it is challenging for a writer to dare to do this.In this essay, a layered cake is used as the metaphor for the world and our perception of it. The icing represents our surface only existence. Only Shamans can break free to explore all the inner layers.  In the end we are encouraged to take the plunge into knowledge and awaken humanity to the fullness of existence.This book was a confusing book, (and probably also Atwood&#8217;s Surfacing book, which I did not read) which explains/applies the brilliant concepts which are clearly detailed in Joseph Campbell&#8217;s book, Hero of a Thousand Faces.

The London club has been calling to Nissa ever since she found out about them. Determined to gain entrance to the club and maybe one day even into the ranks of the undead, Nissa finally makes a contact that gets her invited.On her fist night at the club, Nissa is intent of full-filling her most darkest fantasies - and the Midnight Playground is just the place to do so. Drawn to the upper floors Nissa comes upon Hex and his maker Aleron. Lovers and friends for 10 years they have had no desire to add to their ranks - only to have fun with the humans that visit the club.Nissa immediately strikes them as different thought. Intelligent, sensual and beautiful, Hex is drawn to her like no other - and while he has shared The Seeking Kiss, blood exchange between a vampire and their human lover, with others, he has had no inclination to share the Turning Kiss with one, until now.Interesting and sexy, I did enjoy this one and hope to read more from Ms. Bradley. I found Hex & Aleron's relationship very sexy and a change from the usual - buddies sharing a chick - which is what I've read before in menage erotica.Another short read, and a very cheap listing, on amazon.com for $2.80 here. I love a good book deal!RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, this is a smut fest, erotica novel. Vampires, threesomes and a lot of slaps and tickles.",neutral,book
1479,"First book in ""Cannon Pack"" series. Followed byDance on the Wilde Side.Plot:Sydney's family are ""Hunters"" - they hunt werewolves (Shifters). As in, shoot them and hang their heads on your walls. Sydney's problem is she a) doesn't want to hunt and b) has erotic dreams of a hunky shifter. When the embodiment of her dreams, Jason, saves her from being eaten by a vicious treadmill, her life (and his!) is never going to be the same.Comments:- Quite a long book (5074 kindle locations).- Bedroom scenes are spicy rather than erotic (not particularly frequent), all m/f with constant references to gay friend and cross-dressing.- It is a different/original take on the human/Shifter relationship (redneck hunters vs suited Shifters), with lots of story and plot.- When I picked up this book, it was on some sort of promotion and thus $0. It isn't now. However, as stated by another reviewer, the cost of the book doesn't really affect my view of the book. Either it's good or it isn't. And because cost fluctuates, it is unfair to judge it based on price.Opinion:This book is quite funny, and enjoyable, however I didn't like it enough to search out Book 2. The characters are strong and interesting enough but the book could have been half the size and still covered the same material. There isn't anything particularly wrong with this book, it does okay for a light Shifter book. It just didn't grab me as much as other books in the paranormal genre.",neutral,book

However, much of the word usage errors, evocation of emotions and storylines that didn't feel true to form dogged down the storyline for me.  Word usage such as executor instead of executioner, scared for scarred and vice versa.  Conversations between the main protagonist and antagonist that just didn't ring true or feel ""real"".  The second occasion of fastwalk appeared to be the protagonists first time and inspired the main character to react in ways that just didn't seem in any way real or believable.

I don't think it's necessary to know the look of the scene at every moment, or the clothes the characters are wearing, or other things that really don't pertain to the story, especially in a story that is supposed to be fast-paced.

Unfortunately, from the beginning I felt like this was the 2nd or 3rd book of a series. The background is sort of filled in eventually, but it takes almost the entire book to do so, including the 'bonus story.'While I do love the characters Count and Kara, everything else about the book was difficult to follow and enjoy. The flow of the plot was not smoothe. The other characters seemed unfinished. I don't normally mind being thrown in the middle of a setting with gradual background information released as I read, but the author did a poor job of intergrating the reader into his world at a good pace. The beginning was very busy and had a lot going on, only as a recap in his hospital stay, and THEN the reader is put into the present time, which is slow moving. The bonus story felt like another ""how I met this other character"" mini story that was put in at random fillers during the plot.Count and Kara are good characters. The others need more polish.

1706,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- Zane is in pitiful condition at the start of the story, but he&#8217;s not pitiful himself. He&#8217;s hurt and unhappy, but he doesn&#8217;t wallow in his misery. I immediately wanted someone to wrap him up in something soft and love on him.- The characters are all three likeable enough, but Randy especially is kooky. His quirkiness amused me.- I&#8217;ve read a lot of stories by this author, and the majority of them are about 80% sex. In this story, I was delighted to discover that the physical scenes didn&#8217;t start until over halfway through. That allowed for some more character development early on than is typical of Michael&#8217;s works.CONS:- Butch and Randy have been together for a while when Zane comes along. I didn&#8217;t doubt their attraction to him, nor did I doubt their willingness to invite him into their bed. But I would have liked to see a bit of conversation between the two of them before they actually do the propositioning.- I didn&#8217;t find the characters quite believable. Butch is in construction, for instance, yet he says things like this: &#8220;you&#8217;re pretty young to declare an amnesty on dating.&#8221;- Like most of this author&#8217;s works, this one could use some editing. Not just for typos; there are some errors in continuity also.Overall comments: This isn&#8217;t one of my favorites by Sean Michael, but I did like it overall.

1724,"3.5 stars.I only read a couple of m-preg romance, and one I didn't like at all, the other had other themes which were more important and I liked it better. I was reluctant about this particular book. It was good, though. The process through which males can get pregnant and then give birth is explained in a way I found more believable and almost logical in the evolutive history of that world.I must confess that I thought the story would be more violent and angsty, but even if there was a lot of drama, it never really reached unbearable peaks. It was a bit difficult to get into the story at the beginning, because the odd names worked against my reading, then the story became more interesting, with political intrigue and heartache.The main couple was sweet, but unfortunately I wasn't really impressed. Lassen was too good, too passive. I think it was because he was conscious of his role as a concubine and didn't want to play outside his role at court. I didn't really like Rohyr, the King. At the end of the story, when many details were revealed, I couldn't help wondering why he did what he did.***spoiler*** The mate thing brought everything into perspective, but it was as if it came as a second thought, a bit out of nowhere, and I didn't feel it was worked into the story so well.***end spoiler***The world building was very interesting and rich.

As is often the case with erotic novels, the author resorts to some hokey euphemisms for the characters' sex organs (petals of her sheath, anyone?) Still, the characters' encounters will get you riled up.With that said, the characters lack depth, making it difficult to become invested in their outcomes. I can't help feeling some of the time spent on the sex scenes would have been better spent fleshing out some of the supporting cast a little better. As a result, what should have been two touching scenes at the end of the book lacked conviction and warmth. The book got off to a strong start, then petered out (no pun intended) toward the end. Transitions became sloppy and there's one unnecessary flash back (yay, gratuitous sex!) that I found it hard to care about.Do I regret reading this? No. Am I invested enough to continue the series?

1970,"Apparently I have a thing for dragons, and there aren&#8217;t even any shifters in here, go figure! I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the plot of Maiden Flight. A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some of that with the upcoming books.",neutral,book

2066,"I gave this book three stars based solely on the fact that it was well written, meaning that grammar and spelling were on point and that the story flowed fairly well.

Things came to a head much too quickly for it to have been believable and the heroine going from, &#34;I hate this guy&#34; to &#34;well, I guess I can give him a chance&#34; was too much for me to take in.

And why does he keep nibbling on her when they kiss? While working the case, she learns there's a lot going on in her town that she ever knew about--and her job is on the line!This book was just OK. The storyline of the book was pretty good, but it really needed a good line editor to suggest parts that could have been cut out and streamlined. It tended to drag and bog down in parts. I got tired of some of the repetitive stuff....like run ins with annoying Dirk, how many times we had to hear it had been five years since Elena had sex, etc. The character development was weak--I didn't connect with either of the main characters. I would have liked more development of the relationship between Bo and Elena. Seems like they had sex, and then boom they are supposedly in love.This is the second book I've read by Mary Hughes.

Yes, There are 2 'love' scenes in it, but one the author described as rushed kind of affair... and the other happens in the end.Truly this is an adventury kind of book. My husband asked me what I was reading and I told him a book that reminded me of that Kevin Costner movie ""The Postman"" (1*997).You have breakdown of a society..our world. So picture the whole 'postman' setting- people living without electricty and the like. There is one community/colony where Dan and other cool people (I really like the characters she puts in place) live together to stay safe. Of course- in this world we have to have some drama- so there is a band of bad guys- so we have those too.Now Dan comes across Selena in a scouting kinda thing. And I won't give anything away.

He hires artists' model Ryan Morgan, a man rumored to be willing to do more than just model if the price is right.  Harley's immediately attracted to Ryan, but Ryan's not gay...is he?Ryan's been down on his luck for a long time.  After taking on odd jobs and whatever he can find, he sees a notice for nude models and takes the job.  He soon finds that women are willing to pay for more than just modeling, and before he knows it his life is going out of control.  Meeting Harley only adds more chaos to his life.  Will Ryan figure out his feelings before he destroys everything?An artist falling for his straight model is a cool idea for a story, so I was really excited to read Life Class.  Unfortunately, while Life Class had an interesting storyline, hot sex scenes, and lots of conflict, I couldn't get into it.  My problem with the story wasn't the story or the conflict, but the characters.  Both Harley and Ryan manipulate each other and are cruel to each other many times.  Harley pretends not to be trying to lure Ryan into his bed, when in actuality he is.  At one point, he furthers his seduction with a move so cynical he lost any chance he had of being likeable in my eyes.  Ryan is indecisive and explosive.  He gets angry at Harley and hurts him both physically and emotionally.  By the end, he's in a position that makes it hard to see if he's with Harley because he cares or because he has to be.  The happy ending rang false for me because of that.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",neutral,book

However, even though parts of series and more could be related for knowing previous - I still believe the stories I have read in this series can stand alone.  Which I prefer as I hate to be beholden to reading serial type works.  Good show that as (seeming these days) I run into many that really require all be read and in order.In this one we find Argus a college graduate, a loner who comes into a mysterious package thrust on him at busstop.  The tale unfolds as Argus and his co -worker and roommates try to figure out what the package contents mean and why/how related to Argus.  Again, this author shows creative abilities with his premise and the pieces that seem random - but ultimately tie together.  This one is related to a supernatural place and supernatural events.  As is the other one I read (likely all four are).  The supernatural bits are not overdone or ""hokey "" to this reader and while it seems to jump around a bit - I believe this is due to various people working their part of the puzzle and author intent versus just jumping around without cohesive plot planned.I really enjoy reading this author's work. I just find the numerous grammar and punctuation errors distracting and reduced the rating one star for such.  As the errors are quite numerous.Regardless of errors, many will enjoy this read if they like the genre.Christine",neutral,book

No luck buying Kindled Murakamai in Australia so I decided to give this new writer a go- the price was reasonable enough.There are some Murakami-esque elements to the novella, slightly surreal plot and characters who are somewhat removed from everyday life. There is a certain clunkiness to the writing and the narrator's introspection can be somewhat annoying. I think the weaknesses are just first-timer issues that will improve with experience and a good editor.The Kindle versio has some justification issues when there is dialogue and someone has been careless with Spellcheck as there are a few typos that tend to be homophones, eg ""suite yourself"" and ""this will due"".

2325,"PJVs QUICKIE POV: I seem to be hungry as of late. {har har Primal Hunger get it???} For some reason my schedule has left me hiding under the covers with my kindle. Hence, all of the ebooks. Or was it my over-indulgence in YA? Had to jump out of the teenie-bopper realm and get me so down and dirty adult PNR. Whatever it is, I have fallen in love with Samhain Publishing and all of their paranormal picks. Primal Hunger is my latest conquest and it has me eager to read more of Somers' writings. An interesting concept, Somers pairs Arthurian legend with shape-shifters and gargoyles, didn't know this would make for smoking hot read...but isn't that what makes for great fiction?REVIEW: Kennedy, the hot bartender from Pendragon's with a sharp tongue and a penchant for trouble-making, has found herself in a situation. She's been hot for the co-owner for like forever, but he can barely stand her. So, when her car breaks down outside the club and he pulls up to assist her, she's not exactly wanting to be alone with him in fear that her hots for him might become evident.Tristan is the object of Kennedy's desires, but he is also a gargoyle shape-shifter and immortal to boot. He has been on a mission for a long time, to save his brother. He has no time for women, especially women like Kennedy. Why he stops he doesn't know - but instinct takes over and Kennedy is getting in his car - and then all hell breaks loose.Shot with a tranquilizer Kennedy has to save Tristan as they go on a break-neck run to save both of their lives. Doped up, with all inhibitions gone, Tristan finally lets his cat out of the bag and begins to seduce Kennedy - not like it was very hard. From that moment on, Kennedy's life will never be the same, hanging with immortals is not exactly good for a girl's livelihood.I really liked the concept of this book, I'm a sucker for Arthurian legend, even though it was just lightly touched upon. The book really didn't do much to explain a correlation between gargoyle cat shifters and the Knights of the Round table. But, this book actually did little explaining, because it really was more erotica than paranormal romance. So - Primal Hunger was smoking hot and a delectable kitty pounces unsuspecting human book, but again I would have liked to see more plot expansion. I feel I'm being critical though, because with the length of this novel and the story-line I believe it achieved what it set out to do - entertain and titillate.RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, this is an erotica novel. Fans of shifters should enjoy.",neutral,book

It was a nice way to communicate the story in the first third of the novel.  With that being said, this novel added nothing else new to the romance genre.

2383,"Just like several other reviewers of this book, I had to walk away from reading it several times before I could get it all down.  (And I have a seriously strong stomach for violence.)  This is rape.  There's no other word for it.  I've recently started reading BDSM books after never having gone beyond so-called ""bodice-rippers"" in my 63 years.  Flat-out rape is a legitimate plot device, but I find the conversion of the victim into a willing wife to be offensive. She fell into the hands of a predatory stalker, and she got gang-raped by him and his employees.  To have her then succumb to his manly wiles just makes her look stupid, on top of that.  I had thought better of the author.  I read Harlequin novels in 1976 where the ""heroine"" fell in love with her rapist and married him, but generally, those were written for very stupid women.Apparently times have not progressed much.  I've read a number of BDSM books lately where the characters are interesting and well-written, and where they make rational decisions based upon the actions in the stories.  Once she stopped biting the head rapist here, I stopped believing this story.I also second the mention in another review that the description of the device they built to hold her was inadequate.  Readers are not incapable of visualizing a device, if the description is clear.  In this case, it was appallingly unclear.  The author might as well have just said that they were using magic wands to hold her and move her around.  Additionally, I was greatly concerned with the eventual use to which the pictures of her were to be put.  It is all well and good to say that the five rapists ""love her"", but the pictures they took and posted on the wall of screens could both be used to destroy her career, and to send them to prison for years, had she chosen to be litigious, as she should have.  It kept distracting me from the story, every time that wall of screens was mentioned.  (What can I say?  I used to work in a law school.)The author is an intelligent woman.  She writes well, and she spells well, and she punctuates well.  Her prose is clear (although not her description of that device).  I gave her an extra star for having paid attention in English class.  And at two stars for content, I was being generous.  Rape is appalling, but understandable.  Falling in love with the rapists, all five of them, is not.  The other reviewers have mentioned the victim's deeply-hidden desire to be loved, and her Daddy issues.  More cliches.  Rape is rape.",neutral,book

2728,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I feel that the idea of the book was a good one (what would survival after a catastrophic event look like).However I felt the characters were not appropriate for the adversity and the challenging experiences that the author wanted to explore.Let me say that I felt there was a fair amount of thought put into the steps needed to have the characters survive. This was a strong plus towards making the in the book creditable, if not for the characters ages.I liked that the book took place over two and a half year time frame, giving opportunities for us (the reader) to see how the characters lives might unfold and what other issues would come up.What I did not like about the book can be narrowed down to two things.One (and this was the biggest) was that the age of the characters was simply too young to cover the issues that the author was trying to tackle, making it all seem less believable.For example our main character 'Chief' Mike. At age 13 and a half, he takes on the role of leader for the surviving teenagers. The concerns and decisions that he comes up with are far greater then what a 13 year old would come up with. Even given that he might be more 'mature' emotionally then others his age, however there is no explanation as to 'Why' he would be more mature in his understanding of life and leadership. Without this explanation, his 'judgements' and 'rules' do not sit right with reality. I am left to say, ""That's pretty wise for an early teenager, and where is his teen emotions?""I could do this same break down with the remaining characters, but you can get the idea with this one and I shouldn't go on and on about that.The next issue that I have with the book is that often the mini-crises in the story do not flow with the over all story. They seem to be cut and pasted into the storyline. It would have been more realistic to have less events play out then to have the extra mini-crises.For example the whole lodge situation, it was announced, then left until the last part of the book to be hastily played out. I felt it was poorly played out leaving me feeling flat about its resolution.So what do I think of the story and do I recommend it?I think it is worth the read, but one should have low expectations, just as you would for a 'made for T.V.' movie as opposed to a 'made for the theater' movie. If you lower your expectations you probably will enjoy this book. Because I actually did enjoy it once I finally decided just to let the 'issues' be and imagine the characters say five years older (each).Due to some of the content (rape, murder and violence) within the book, I would recommend it to readers above the age of 16.I would like to see other works by this author, as I enjoyed the storyline, and feel that maybe in time the author will improve his craft.",neutral,book

But she has to go alone...or else. Her friend Val has been gone a month with no clues to her whereabouts. As the first lead, she's determined not to screw it up. So she goes, and meets one of the sexiest men alive.Sin-Bad Stoner is an old vampire who believes he's finally found the one woman who can fulfill his every need and desire. Unbeknownst to her, the brown-skinned beauty has been the subject of all his thoughts and efforts for a long time and it looks like those efforts are finally paying off.  However, she's not about to surrender quietly. So he'll just use all his vampiric wiles to lure her to his home and dominate her until she does.As a reviewer and as a reader, I've long loved everything vampire and everything BDSM:  The darker and edgier the better. When I saw this book contained both those subjects, I was intrigued. After all, what could be more compelling than an uber dominant vampire?  There were references in the story that Sin did not use any mind tricks to compel Chandra to remain with him that first night, or to like the sex they shared. But it did seem, all the same, that she was trying to fight her natural inclination to get away from him.Sin was not a very likeable character, sad to say. All throughout the story, he waxed on and on about the size of his package, but it was actually difficult to discern which was larger: that, or his unbelievably inconsiderate arrogance. On the one hand, he anonymously sent Chandra gifts before they met, so one would think his desire was to romance her. But then, after they met, he expected her to automatically capitulate blindly to his whims and desires. At one point, he even demanded she eschew all her thoughts of upholding the law as was her credo as a police officer and blindly submit to his dominance. And when she wouldn't do what he asked, he would toss her declarations of love back in her face, saying that she would do it if she loved him, reminding me of a petulant school bully, rather than a dark and intense vampire regardless of his origins.With Sin's two other sexy brothers, and a delicious premise, I really wanted to like Night of Sin but I just couldn't get past his boorishness to like the rest of the story. Because it had such promise, I find myself wanting to read other works by Marilyn Lee. I refuse to give up on this author after one read. After all, others might enjoy it, but I'd recommend giving it a pass.",neutral,book
2999,"Tricked Truth by Beth KeryI don't usually clarify my star rating but I felt I needed to with this story.  I almost always enjoy her stories to a varying degree, from good to very good except this story.  Oh...and except Velvet Cataclysm which I didn't like at all. Her writing style in this book is a bit like poetry in the way she uses her words.  Okay maybe not poetry but I don't know the word to describe it so here is an example.

She was married to Trick's father Evan, so she is his stepmother!  Grace is described as his mother-in-law several times in the story, talk about confusing and not a good start to this book.

For the most part, Grace was Tricks whippy post, figuratively speaking that is--and she let him.  That's the part I disliked most, her hypnotic like acceptance of his treatment.  I understood it sure and it was explained at the end but I don't have to like it though.Then there was the mad dash to the end of the story where explanations' and secrets were revealed.  His reaction to these secrets was not what I expected meaning not much of a reaction.  No outrage or anger. The ending was just too rushed for me. I needed more closure.",neutral,book
3023,"Like the air being let out of a balloon, the pleasure and quality of Highland Beast rapidly diminished. And I'm sorry to say that because I was pretty excited to get into this book at the very beginning.The world building was very basic and very poorly done. Like an outline, with no substance. There wasn't a lot of background about the witch, who she was, why she did what she did. No motive, no nothing. Just a bunch of sex, which was pretty good and half way decent, until I realized that was all there was going to be.I found myself wanting the book to end, which is really sad being that it was only about seventy pages long. The dialogue was really bad and so borderline cheesy that I found myself rolling my eyes near the end.And don't even get me started on the character development. I don't remember once being told any facts or real details aside from her being an empath and that she felt lonely/rejected all the time.Overall, not the worst book I've read, but by far, definitely not the best.",neutral,book
3027,"To preface my review, I will definitely say that this book was very well written for a such a short read. The main characters are Jayda who is able to shift to both a wolf and a cougar, her boyfriend Cole - a wolf, and Zane a cougar shifter. As the story excerpt indicates her boyfriend Cole brings out the wolf in her and through his help (intimately) she is able to shift to a wolf, however with him her cougar is latent and vice versa, with Zane she is able to shift to a cougar and with him her wolf is latent. Thse are both men who are head of their respective councils and have a deep-seated distrust for each other..you can see where this is leading!Naturally as the audience, we are privy to Jayda's feelings and the sense of disquiet she feels because although Cole wants to mate with her and she loves him, she is unable to commit to him because she is not only a wolf. We get that she loves Cole and she is torn, especially after meeting Zane, being sexually attracted to him and shifting with him. Ultimately it came to a head where she wants/needs both of them to complete her. I had a problem with the way the author wrote Jayda's reaction when she brought the two men together and had sex with them. I felt like it was all about her...I thought that Jayda's character was selfish because Cole was never given enough time to actually come around to the idea that Jayda's polymorphic state meant that both her animals needed mates. It was like she was there at the finish line in knowing what she needed to feel happy and instead of giving him the time to come around so he could meet her there, she was angry that there was jealous and resentment on his part. Ultimately it worked out, but because I felt disconnected from Jayda, it ruined the story for me!On another note, can anyone recommend an author or books where the opposite happens? What I mean is that I am tired of the same old alien, cyborg, vampire, shifter relationships where the same theme abounds...way too much men and not enough women to go around so of course there is the lucky female with two (or three) hunks after her. I would like to read about a FFM relationship where there is an alien, cyborg, vampire, shifter theme where more females than male presiding and there is a lucky guy who's got two (or three) beauties loving him!!",neutral,book

It seemed drawn out more than it needed to be.

3131,"I agree with some of the other reviewers of this book in that I believe the race card is played alittle too strongly.  I believe that unfortuantely, there still is racism in this country and I understand that is what the author was trying to convey.  My issue was mostly with the parts of the book where the author decided to add in the main character, Will Pruett, a young black reporter's, thoughts throughout the book.  We get that he is black but he is an educated man who does not speak like a 13 year old street person at any other point in the book so stop trying to make him think in a completely different tone of voice than he actually speaks.  It seemed the author was trying to ram down our throats that he was black by adding these thought bubbles in and it was completely distracting and unnecessary.  You can't make him 2 different people, he is either an educated man who happens to be black or he is the disgusting stereotype of an uneducated black man who cannot speak proper english, pick one.  Other than that, the second half of the story was really good.  I was interested in the story line and the second half definitely had a twist I was not necessarily expecting which I enjoyed.  It kept me hooked all the way to the end to find out how the story would be resolved.

3242,"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).",neutral,book

While these types of sentences can give depth to a story, when such descriptive language is used multiple times in each paragraph it gets too flowery.Another issue I have is the cover and title. How embarrassing for anyone to see you carrying this around. It doesn't do the story any justice and could, in fact, scare some readers away. Yes, there are sex scenes. They are definitely not as X-rated as the cover and title would lead one to believe.I got this as a free download and, honestly, didn't know if I'd ever read it since the cover gave me the wrong impression.

3550,"""I'm a left-leaning organic farming peacenik, and you're a dedicated member of the military-industrial complex.""Soleil Freeman and West Morgan had a brief affair five months ago. Although they heated up the sheets, their short lived liaison was more notable for the fighting. Now, months later, Soleil is noticeably pregnant and still in semi denial. A child had never been in her game plan. Added to that, she is struggling with exactly how to (whether to) tell West. He is a Special Forces officer in the Air Force and has been back at his base in Colorado since their last and, as it turns out, most consequential encounter.But surprise! West has come back to town to take care of his father who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and he runs into a Soleil who has some explaining to do.After I read this book I was both very impressed and profoundly disappointed. I think my disappointment comes from the fact that this was a nice read, but there was a great read struggling to get out. There was so much here that the reader could sink their teeth into and, unfortunately, none of it got the treatment it deserved.This book touched on the following: political identity & idealism, divorce, single parenthood v. marriage, how children view their parents and vice/versa, the ways in which children internalize parental expectations, and how love works with all of these.I think the cover of the book is so incredibly misleading. It is not some bubbly tale of a secret baby. Soleil's pregnancy and her reconnection with West is the main story, but the subplots and secondary characters are very vital and interesting in the story and are much deeper than the cover implies. And therein lies my biggest problem. I was incredibly engrossed in West's struggle with dealing with the twin blows of impending fatherhood and the fact that his larger than life father was going through terrifying bouts of dementia. I was equally drawn in by Julia's, West's mother's, re-entry into the dating world (she and West's father have been divorced for many years) and the wonderful new guy she meets. And I was incredibly intrigued by the very prickly, yet fascinating relationship Soilel has with her famous, idiosyncratic mother. BTW, I loved Soleil's background -- her hippie, down with the establishment middle class white-bread mother becomes a radical and hooks up with a Black Panther who himself later becomes establishment thereby dooming that relationship. Lol. Soleil's mother is a One woman character play waiting to happen.SO when the book ends with only West and Soleil's relationship sewn up, I felt like I was cut adrift. Even the resolution of West and Soleil's relationship wasn't completely satisfactory. It seemed so incredibly rushed. The two of them were coming from fundamentally different places. I never felt the two of them came together adequately for each other. Sure they pledge their love, but it is a Harlequin, you expect that. I didn't completely feel it. Don't get me wrong, the author creates a great connect between the two but she really needed more pages to explore it more.And that is the crux of the issue for me. I think this book needed a good 100 to 200 more pages to really satisfy me. The writing here was very good and the characters were excellent. I simply needed more time with them.",neutral,book

The fact that it's relatively short and just 99 cents definitely helped. But frankly, I was a little disappointed.First, the other reviewer's comment about the formatting for Kindle was spot on. Bizarre characters, strange indenting, chapter titles that start at the bottom of a page, typos - it needs some cleaning up. It's very distracting when you're trying to get into a story. That said, the formatting in no way influenced my rating.The Haircut is a wonderful concept but the execution could have been better. The back and forth in the barber shop went on *forever* using the same words and phrases. I understand that the barber was conflicted about the girl's request. I understand the girl wanted it done ""like the boy's haircut."" But the characters just kept saying the exact same thing. I enjoy scenes of conflict but this one just got tedious.As I said, I don't read romances so perhaps this is a common device, but the repetition throughout seemed to be included to simply fill space. It was so distracting and frustrating, in fact, that I simply stopped reading about 60% in. I mean, the ending isn't any secret, is it?So why did I give it three stars?

For an old book from the British/""By Anonymous"" erotic sub-genre, the prose is bouncy, fast-moving, and the outlook generally upbeat (no mean-spiritness, or bad judgements toward the women for enjoying the sex).  The book is of a decent length, and laid out (no pun intended) nicely for the Kindle, as if someone actually spent time to cleanly convert the text to the digital medium.

3996,"When I first saw this cover on Facebook, I commented that I thought it was an ad for breast self examinations, and that would be a good thing. Then I somehow bought the book on Amazon and started reading it.  It made me think about all the different times and ways in which Cinderella has been presented in my life. Naked men and satyrs and pirates never really entered into it before.My first Cinderella was, no doubt, a little Golden Book Version and in 1965 I remember my mom being really excited about a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that was going to be on TV (CBS) with Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon (you know him from General Hospital). Mom was excited about it because Celeste Holm, Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon were in it. Lesley Ann Warren was a trained ballet dancer so that was going to add something. Perhaps my mother thought that would inspire me. I don't know, in ballet I always felt I had missed all the classes where we learned anything.Back then, in black and white on our thirteen-inch screen (which we had until 1972), it was magical. The music was great and I was transported. It did nothing for my career in the ballet school being taught in the fire station however.Then, in a service internship in college I interned at a state run theater and they ran Cinderella. Because it was the state we had all kinds of educational information around it. They discussed how the story was very old and they had traced it all the way to China.It certainly has had a lot of versions filmed and written throughout the years, I even saw that there is a Sin-derella from 1965. We also have the socio/psycho/anthrop-logical theories brought out of fairy tales. White knights, Peter Pan and uncomfortable shoes!What about this version of Cinderella? Queen Ella is now 31 and really horny since her Prince Charming turned into Prince Charles (ie. boring, unfaithful) and disappeared. The way she is described she reminds me of one of the Gabor sisters. She decides to hold a masquerade ball so she can find a sexual partner and incognito have sex with him.After she meets the man of her dreams at the ball but doesn't learn his name she decides to throw a second ball to find him. This time another fantasy is realized. After the second ball she realizes who her mystery lovers are. Forces, in the form of her mendacious step family in a neighboring kingdom conspire to keep them apart and bring back Prince Charming who is now a gay pirate.Will Ella and her mystery beau survive? Will Ella, Charming and his pirate lover get it on? Will Ella be cast out in disgrace? Or will they all live happily ever after?****This isn't so much a retelling as a sequel: Cinderella the Post-Charming Years.The intimate scenes are sexy even though I also found then icky. The sex wasn't terribly inventive. I had a hard time deciding if we were back in days of yore or in a post-industrial kingdom. They had a tub and bathroom with running water, but it did not seem they had cars or telephones.The book was highly predictable plot wise, although Prince Charming ending up being different than I thought he would be. It's possible I have read too many erotica books but I pretty much knew what would happen after the first 30 pages.Are there any redeeming qualities? Well Queen Ella comes off a mature,not dependent on men, and a good ruler with an egalitarian spirit. And, it isn't a retelling which was nice. The relationship between Ella and her beau is loving.I bought the Kindle version which was only $3.44.

4178,"I had high hopes for this novel.  Given the subject matter and the fact that I'm a fan of historical fiction (Follett, Kalogridis) I tore into Children of Salem shortly after downloading it.I was disappointed.I won't to into too much detail about the plot.  Jeremy Wakely is sent from Boston to look into the questionable practices of a puritan minister in Salem, Mass. Jeremy has a history in Salem and is reluctant to go back but he does so out of honor...and because of a girl.  Jeremy is thrust neck deep into the mystery and lunacy that was the Salem Witch Trials of the late 17th century.The Salem Witch Trials was one of the darkest and most interesting periods in American history.  With that as a backdrop, I was very much looking forward to tearing my way through this book.It's not that Walker's a bad writer.  The historical aspects are well covered and he does give the reader a good sense of how it was for people living in that area of the country at that time in history.No, the main problem with this book is the pacing.  It's S-L-O-W.  It says it's a little over 400 pages but it certainly feels longer than that.  The book is filled with frequent drawn out conversations where the participants seem to be reiterating the same things over and over again.  Frankly, it spoiled my enjoyment of the book.I'm not an instant gratification type of reader.  I don't mind a nice build up to a big reveal or a good ending but sometimes I felt it was a chore to get through the conversations to see what the next development in the story was.The love angle between Jeremy and Serena didn't seem to 'pop', that's the best way I can think to describe it.  I think it's partially because many of the characters just seemed to read the same way.  With a few standouts, most of the characters seemed to speak the same exact way and had the same type of personalities.I don't mean to bash it.  I'm sure this novel couldn't have been easy to write, especially considering the historical aspect of it.  It just left me feeling a little let down.I didn't think it was bad, I didn't think it was great either.  I give it a solid 'okay'.",neutral,book

4369,"The previous book I read by Mari Carr - ""Covert Lessons"", published by Ellora's Cave - was terrible, so I didn't go into this one with very high expectations. However, this book was put out by a different publisher and therefore had a different editor. I found this book to be a great improvement over ""Covert Lessons"".Gwen Preston has written a popular book of sex-themed short stories called Evening Songs. One of the stories, The Darkest Night, contained scenes of BDSM and Gwen, ashamed of her real-life interest in BDSM because (in part) of a previous relationship that went bad, used a pen name for that story.Ty Ransome is a Hollywood action star who wants to turn over a new leaf and do ""serious"" films. He has read Evening Songs and thinks the book would make a good basis for a movie. He has also discovered that Gwen was the true author of *all* of the stories in the book. This intrigues him because he is secretly a sexual dominant. He offers to purchase the movie rights to the stories with the requirement that Gwen help him write the screenplay.Gwen comes to Hollywood, and Ty puts her up in his guest house. He begins to visit her late every night, after she is in bed, and they talk for hours. Ty makes it clear that he is interested in her in more than a platonic way. Gwen initially keeps him at bay, but he eventually convinces her that he is sincere and also that they should reenact the scenes in her short stories as a way to help them develop the screenplay. Gwen agrees. During the course of this reenactment, Gwen and Ty discover each others secrets - that she is a submissive who craves (some) pain with sex and that he is a dominant who enjoys dishing out what she needs.I liked the chemistry between the main characters and the fact that the relationship didn't start out with sex right away. I do wish that we had gotten to experience a little more of that initial phase of the relationship rather than simply being told that it happened. I also liked that Gwen has a spine. She doesn't immediately cave to Ty's desires, and she's got a few good zippy comebacks for him. Ty is good hero; he is patient when Gwen seems to need it and later forceful in way that doesn't make him seem like an ass.However, this book still suffers from some of the same basic writing problems as ""Covert Lessons"" - avoiding ""said"" as a dialogue tag (my biggest pet peeve); characters inferring the thoughts of other characters and telling the readers that, rather than the author *showing* the reader, occasional bits of stilted dialogue. The flaws are not as prevalent, though, so I don't know if it's result of the different editor, or if the author is improving her craft on her own.I might try another of Ms. Carr's books if the plot sounded interesting and as long as it wasn't from EC.",neutral,book

4635,"Having enjoyed my way through all of his major works, I am now filling in the remaining gaps in my reading of FP Wilson.  This one, ""Virgin"", was originally published in 1996 under the pseudonym, Mary Elizabeth Murphy. I have no clue why he used a nom de plume, except possibly that it is rather different from everything else that he had written to date.  Not horror, not SF, but your basic religious fantasy.  The eponymous Virgin is, indeed, Mary, the mother of Jesus, the one straight out of the standard Christian theology.This is nothing like Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code or any of his other novels.  Although the characters move around a lot, it's not anything like a treasure hunt, or, at least after the early sections of the novel, a mystery to be solved.  It's worth pointing out that it was published long before Brown sold millions of copies books dealing with supposed hidden truths of the Catholic Church. Anyway, the premise is interesting (as it is with all FP Wilson writings that I have seen), and to my knowledge is one of the first mainstream ""what if it were true"" novels dealing with the iconography of ChristianityAlthough published well after many of his blockbuster novels that made FPW a household name (at least among horror aficionados, Virgin has the feel of an ""early"" novel.  I'm not sure how to describe it more specifically than that.  It just didn't feel as solid as most of FPW's other works.  The characters of Father Dan and Sister Carrie are well enough developed FPW's usually are), and their early relationship is is believable.  Later developments between the two, well, less so.  Supporting characters were also three-dimensional with interesting backstories, particularly the mysterious Israeli agent who seems to have a special agenda with respect to the relic.For me the biggest disappointment in this novel was the ending.  After a more than reasonable build-up, the last 20% of the novel, especially the literal deus ex machina ending just left me feeling cheated.  As if FPW had jumped the proverbial (pun intended) shark.  I just didn't find the sequence of events believable or compelling or even logical (if anything based in religious mythology can be said to be logical).  The ending felt rushed, and cheap compared to the set-up, and to the endings to the dozens of other FP Wilson novels that I've read.Perhaps it's in part because I'm not a ""true believer"", and have always had trouble understanding how so many so easily accept the whole Christian mythos when it seems so full of logical flaws and impossibilities.  Anyway, this one didn't do it for me.  It was OK, but not nearly in the same league as the Repairman Jack or Adversary Cycle series, or many of his other parts of the Secret History of the World (e.g., Black Wind, published in 1988, being a prime example of FP Wilson at his best.)J.M.

4720,"Unlike a lot of reviewers, I don't agree that this is a bad novel or a waste of time. Some reviewers are arguing that this shouldn't be listed as a romance, I disagree with that as well, just because one half of the couple bites it (almost literally) doesn't disqualify the romantic aspect of the relationship, it's only love if both people make it? I think a lot of people are upset that there's no happily ever after in this book because that's what they've come to expect from a lot of UF novels, I much prefer the more realistic approach of this author, life and love most oft do not end the way we would like it to.I particularly like the authors writing style, he manages to convey emotion and emphasis sometimes with only few sentences composed of less than five words, stripped down to just the facts which functions much like a slap to the face, I find that this sometimes manages to convey more than the purple prose so many authors are fond of employing. Not to say that he doesn't at times get prosey, he does, however, when he chooses to do so it's appropriate and adds rather than detracts from the tale.  People complained about the violence and the drug use, but you know what, there are people out there that have lived and still live like that, kids like Molly who are snatched from their parents and forced into the sex trade, just because it makes people uncomfortable to know about it or read about it, doesn't negate it's existence.All of that is not t say that I didn't check out at some points in the novel, the excessive (and prosey) back story on Theroen bugged me and I did skip sections of it (only to come back and read it), but it does explain a good amount of the character's motivations and actions. The section where Molly was introduced was also a very difficult part for me, having volunteered with severely abused women and children most of whom had been trafficked from China, I'll admit to having a nightmare or two for a few days after reading and I had to set the book aside for a bit. The one thing that bothered me perhaps the most, was that Two decided to return to help Molly and the others only after she lost Theroen, her vampirism and needed to take Darren down for some quick cash. I almost stopped reading when she was rationalising away all the reasons why she shouldn't return for them. It would also have been good to understand why of everyone else, Theroen picked Two and what had been his criteria for doing so, had he been watching her? If so, for how long?Was this a good read? Yes. Would I recommend it to someone else? Definitely. I like the authors writing style, I appreciate that he wasn't afraid to take chances with a starting storyline I'm pretty sure he knew would rub a lot of people the wrong way, but he did it anyway and didn't sanitise it. I almost didn't pick this up because of some of the bad reviews, but I'm really happy that I ignored them and went ahead with it anyway.",neutral,book

There really is someone for everyone and this book was a testament to that. The only issue I had with this book was it was just too darn short. I wish the author gave me more.,neutral,book
5309,"This was the 10th and final entry in Mallery's Hometown Heartbreakers series. (Only half are currently available on the Kindle). And like several of the books in this series, the style is a little more serious than most of her other stuff I've read.It was a good story, but not a traditional romance. The heroine survived a horrid childhood by becoming a tough a**. This isn't just talk, a character description that really has no bearing on the boy-meets-girl plot. She lives the life: collects martial arts black belts, participates in war games, only has one female friend, etc. She also has a series of jobs (that we only hear about, don't really see) that can be dangerous, even violent. Her initial interest in the hero is because he is better than she is at fighting, and she wants him to teach her.There was just one thing that bothered me. From the start, the hero recognized that he had to keep the heroine off balance to hold her attention. So, all their interactions for most of the book were studied on his part. In one scene, for instance, he doesn't compliment her on her appearance when first he sees her, because she would be expecting it. He does so later in the evening, when it's a surprise. This might seem minor, but how honest is he in their getting to know each other, when all his actions and conversation are geared to unsettling her?It's different, but well done.",neutral,book

I would have liked to learn a little more about Sera and her gifts.The entire time I was reading it I kept thinking back to Linda Howards White Out which can be found in Strangers in the Night. The premise seemed similar. Being snowed in but Howards was more of a story. I really enjoyed that one.

In fact, it seems the authors of the Didache simply cut and paste snippets taken from the New Testament and pasted them into this collection of customs, rules, and regulations.

5673,"PLOT: Hospital cafeteria worker Zandrea first bumps into Brant in the ER. He's injured and bleeding but he leaves without receiving treatment. She sees him soon after at a club and his injuries are healed. Brant overhears her discussing him with her friends. He approaches her with the intentions of having his brother erase her memories of him. But something about her calls to his nature and the evening does not go exactly as he planned. He knows that he cannot be without her.PROS: The author weaves a good plot. The love scenes between Zan and Brant are hot.CONS: The character development could be better. We know very little about Zan and Brant. Zan came off as only being immature. When she met Brant, she was hanging out in the ER for a chance to meet a doctor. That's just wrong.Much of the middle of the book they spend separated since Zan has forgotten him. So at the end when they get their ""happy ever after,"" it's not so believable that she loves him and vice versa.It's a minor issue but it speaks to the plausibility of the plot; Zan never actually see's Brant's injury. She sees blood seeping through his shirt. Since she doesn't know how serious his injury was, there's no reason for her to question it and no reason for him to go after her.3 STARS: I gave it three stars since it is an interesting start to a series.

5679,"Okay,I get that it was a free book and you want people to download, get hooked, and then buy the sequels, but 7 chapters?!?! Just when you start to get into the story, the book ends. I found myself having more questions than getting answers. I wanted to know more about max's family. It didn't seem very realistic that all through high school he knows Emma, and all of a sudden he hears her voice 10 years later and he's hot for her. I loved Emma's character. She's smart, sassy, and a little spitfire. I understand that Max is attracted to her because she's probably the first girl to tell him ""no"" (even though she's very attracted to him). Her sense of humor was the best part of the book, I found myself crying I was laughing so hard at some of the comments she makes to her friend Becky and Max's best friend Simon.  There could be something there, but overall I was very disappointed that there were only 7 chapters. I'm glad the book was free when I downloaded it, otherwise I would have been angry with purchasing, and only getting 7 chapters. There was probably just as many excerpts for similar books at the end of the book, as there were chapters IN the book.

Her co-workers gave her the nickname, Candy Girl, because she keeps a candy dish on her desk. Gabe, Julie's boss, has lusted after her since day one. And he hates how the co-workers take advantage of Julie's kindness and generosity. Gabe is there for her when Julie is betrayed by her boyfriend and cousin. He's there for her and sees it as the perfect opportunity to explore his attraction and feelings for her.I enjoyed the book a lot. I felt sorry for Julie. She's the nice girl who can't tell people no. I saw Gabe as Prince Charming, saving the girl from her wicked step-mother. In this case, her mean co-workers.

5765,"I am not really a fan of short stories.  It takes a lot for me to really enjoy one.  That said, My Soul to Lose was the exception to my usual reaction to short stories---I really enjoyed this one!My Soul to Lose is a prequel to Rachel Vincent's Soul Screamers series.  When you start My Soul to Take, Kaylee's stay in a psychiatric unit is alluded to but you get no details.  In My Soul to Lose, we get the rest of the story: what led to Kaylee's hospitalization and her stay in the psychiatric unit.I felt so sorry for Kaylee during this novella!  She has no idea why she sees shadows around people, feels like they are going to die, and then can't stop screaming.  Her aunt and uncle are no help and Kaylee has no one to turn to.  She meets Lydia in the psychiatric unit, but does not forge a friendship with her until the end of the book.  When Kaylee finally finds someone who might know what's going on with her, circumstances change and she is left in the dark again.I would recommend reading this before My Soul to Take.

5877,"This story started off well - lots of mystery, a strange character called Feathers (Feathers?) who is a resident in the block of flats where Izzy and her son go to live, the mysterious woods and spooky  writing on the wall. It soon went downhill for me. Izzy just never stops talking. It seems that everything that pops into her head has to be written out. Sometimes I felt as though I was an observer of a real life situation and being forced to listen to the banal, half-heard conversation of strangers.  She just jabbers on and you soon realize that nothing she says means much. It would probably work better if you had some idea of the emotions Izzy, and the other characters, were feeling. You never quite know. Izzy cries a lot, she gets drunk when any sensible person would figure they would need all their wits, she goes on crying jags, loses her temper, slams things around but you are never completely sure just why.  She vacillates between spunky and helpless within the space of five minutes. I found myself getting thoroughly irritated by her.I could not warm to any of the characters in this story. Izzy was annoying, her son was odd and seemed to mostly hover in the background and Feathers - well he just seemed like an aged hippy who may or may not be a little loopy.  He didn't get my heart beating.  He didn't do a whole lot for Izzy either. Their romance was luke-warm at best.Izzy is pretty stupid. She is told in so many different ways to keep away from the woods but for some reason, she refuses to believe.  Ok, the story needed her to go into the woods and it was a build up in suspense but why then, does she show healthy scepticism about the woods and yet on several occasions later in the story, when something really outstandingly weird happens, she just accepts it?  Despite the scary, scary wood and her idiocy in stirring up the creature in there, as soon as something bad happens her first thoughts were to blame someone else entirely and, to make it even more confusing, she was right.There are a few typos/spelling errors in this book. The spelling of 'neanderthal' was inspired - I am not sure if it was a case of reversing letters or if the author really thought it was spelt that way - and there were several instances of 'breath' instead of 'breathe'.All in all, it was not a waste of my 99c. The story skipped along and there were parts where I felt quite frightened. The magic in the story was unusual enough to be interesting.  I just would have liked it to have had more impact on the outcome of the story.",neutral,book
5897,"There is nothing original in this very short Regency M/M romance.The setting is the usual one, gay aristocrats having to cope with the homophobic, claustrophobic mores of a time and society when laws founded on religious beliefs used to fetter people's life.To this well trodden setting the author adds the usual topic of forced proximity as the two lovers are bound to remain in the same place for a given numer of days and have no way to avoid each other, again a very common choice in this kind of novels.There is one twist though: the two star-crossed lovers have not only already met (this would be common) but they have been lovers in their early youth, until they were separated when one of them, a second son and therefore kind of useless to his father, was sent to war to acquire a status for himself. Problem is that, after five years, he had to come back because (second twist) he has lost his left forearm. Haunted by honour, duty and guilt Ian (the come-back soldier) has to be seduced again because he seems to consider the previous affair with Nicky a juvenile mistake and the attraction he still feels for Nicky something to be repressed.I will not spoil the third twist (a bit contrived) that allows them their happily ever after.All in all the story was captivating. The two main characters are easy to love even if the soldier sounds more childish, at times, than guilt-ridden and the other lover seems a little too unsouciant.The story could surely have born more fleshing out: it takes place within a limited time scope (twelve days) but it needs not have taken twelve pages to be told. There are several moments that feel hurried and character building could have been better.More care should have also been given to the sex scenes: they are emotional because of the baggage the two carry with them but they are not very erotic.",neutral,book

I'm really TRYING not to use any spoilers, since this is a short read, so if you need me to clarify, please ask in the comments.I enjoyed the premise - GARGOYLES! AS SHIFTERS! The characters themselves were pretty generic - Cray was a nice guy/gargoyle. Loretta was a rich heiress just looking for love in all the wrong places.As far as the plot went... it was ok. I felt the whole ""Max"" episode could have been delved into a bit more. It was very cut and dry though ""this happened then this happened then this happened then done."" Also the staging of a dramatic scene was a little confusing as everything (I'm guessing was happening at once) could not have happened. Or perhaps just needed to be cleaned up a bit to make it make more sense [EXAMPLE (not from book)- if I'm on a roller coaster going very fast and there's missing tracks ahead, the passengers and I would not be able to hold a rational conversation in a light airy tone and buffer my nails at the same time]. The great finale I felt was super quick and ""the great revelation"" at the end completely soured the heroine for me. ""The great revelation"" seemed really pointless/unnecessary/inappropriate for the story and made me really just think the h was one dumb selfish beesh, which is sad because I had liked her well enough until that point. It was also very random and just thrown in there for a quick HEA wrap up.Refreshing premise, the romance scenes were nice, certain plot points/situations needed to be tightened a bit, definitely a quick light read.",neutral,book

Poor Ethan kept having naughty thoughts of Violet and would talk to himself.If you want to know my scene let me take you into your bedroom, tie you up and smack that delectable a** until you beg for me. He smiled back. ""You throw a great party.""That night he is ready to call off their friendship, until he takes a bathroom break before leaving the party and finds a box hiding her secrets. Now he knows her secret of wanting to be submissive and will give her what he and her both want. Next day at work he acts different, showing her the real side of him, his dominate side.

He starts Instant Messaging her. Love those messages he sends her. By Chapter 3 is when he had me head over heals for him with one little message.Ethan Sage: Be forewarned, you don't have long until I come get you.Violet is sweet but deep down inside she wants to be submissive. She has a hard time understanding how she can be like this. While the sex club is Sexy-As-Sin it is also sweet with Ethan letting her know if she does not want to go through trying her hand at being submissive then she does not have to. Loved how Ethan is always nipping Violet's ear, nibbling on her lip and stroking her back. There is something sexy when the hero bites the heroine lower lip.""All right then."" He leaned down over the table and to her surprise, his strong , white teeth sank into the flesh of her lower lip.Violet does not always give in easy to Ethan especially when he pisses her off. He has his limits when she provokes him while they are fighting OMG... The alley scene is a scorcher. I freakin love it when the hero talks dirty when he loses a little control.""When I reach you-and make no mistake-I will."" He paced one step forward. She mirrored him keeping the distance between them. ""I'm going to throw you over my shoulder, take you into the alley, and I'm going to spank your a** until it's bright red. Then I'm going to f*** you. So be ready.""She gave him the finger, turned and sprinted away.The only thing I did not enjoy was that Ethan twice used the word Slut during his dirty talking moments. She enjoyed it and it turned her on. But for me it was a big turn off.""Mmmm... I love how you're such a dirty little slut.""We meet Master Caleb as he is doing a scene for Ethan and Violet at the sex club. Master Caleb is a sexy Dom with kicka$$ tattoos and can use a whip like a pro. He literally can whip off shirt buttons with out even touching the skin. The only thing I did not like was when he used the word ""Slut"" while doing a scene. I am hoping this is a series because I am curious about Caleb and what woman can bring him to his knees. He seems like a Dom that likes it raw and rough. Since we only get to see him during a sex scene and he was a very blunt dirty talker. I am curious if he would caress his lover, nibble her bottom lip when kissing her and nip at her ear while saying naughty things to her.This was my second novel by Julia Devlin and will not be my last. I loved the first book I read by her, The Burn List and gave it 5 stars. I really wanted to give this one 5 stars, but  I think the scene in the club was a little too long and wish another scene could of been added. You do feel their chemistry together and good background how they have been friends but I wanted more time of them together with their relationship then just one night in a sex club, the alley and the epilogue. I also did not care for the usage of the word ""Slut"" during their steamy moments. I do love reading BDSM books but love them more when they are well written. I will continue to read her books, she is a talented erotic writer with yummy heroes and sexy scenes.If you do not mind a quick read with all kinds of dirty talking then I would recommend this novel. If you have never read any of Julia Delvin books before I would start with The Burn List. It is 105 pages and a excellent read.",neutral,book
6228,"Gargoyle Damien is on a mission to find one of four missing artifacts important to his people.I liked Stone and Earth for what it was - short and steam packed insta-gargoyle-love.

6369,"*This is a 3.5 Review*When I was a little girl I used to keep a journal, not for normal reasons of course, (I'm way to unconventional for that) but to keep myself from running away.  See, while most girls were busy scribbling notes about boys and what dress they were going to wear to the dance, I was busy fighting off evil warlords or exploring sunken ships.  My writing was an escape, (it still is actually,) and because of it I was able to face down what I thought to be the more ""problematic"" issues of my adolescence. (How hard is a Geography test really gonna be after I just escaped from Hurtsalini -the Mistress of the Underworld's - death grip.) Since my awkward tween days I have stopped journaling, opting for a more ""grown up"" alternative (compiling the worlds longest bucket list) but regardless of the absence of my little green binder the thrill of creating my own world has never left me.In Stephanie Void's novel ""Running From Secrets"" Bethany (the heroine) takes the world of journaling to a whole new level.  Not only does she WRITE the story of her dreams, but after just a few pages, she finds herself LIVING it.""Bethany has never felt as alone as she feels in Linwood--until she dreams up Chime, a woman on the run because of a magic crime she didn't commit. The dreams get more and more urgent, so Bethany tries to banish them by writing them down, only to discover she's stumbled into the role of unwitting controller of Chime's world.Chime is real here, and so is the possessed queen, minion army, mysterious professor, Vault Five, wind chimes with a secret code, child's rhyme that can kill, the naked painting, and other things Chime's story leads her to.She has to fix the story without erasing Chime and her world, because if she erases Chime, she will die as well.""Ok, now...where to start.I guess the most important thing to get across to you (the potential reader) would be that ""I genuinely enjoyed this read.""  It was short, (probably a little too short for all of the features, loops and plot structures it combined,) but regardless of its length it delivered on the most basic of levels: keeping me entertained.That's not to say I didn't spot a few issues though.#1.  The transitions needed help.On more than one occasion I felt myself cringing at the flip between ""fantasy"" and ""real."" Both plot lines were important to the story but the seams connecting the two were choppy and (at times) misplaced. I know I have said this on more than one occasion, but it is important for authors to understand and acknowledge ""flow.""  If (for instance) your ""fantasy realm"" is in the middle of a major plot point, and you decided to pull your character back into ""real life"" with nothing but a # mark, you risk the chance of losing your readers attention.  Cleaning up one ""run"" before starting another is imperative. (I'm not saying settle the whole problem before you move on, just make the scenario solid before you do so.)#2. There were dialogue hiccups.Bethany's manner of speaking took on VERY different rolls depending on whom she was speaking to.  In interactions with her younger sister her words came across as grand-motherly and sophisticated, scroll a few paragraphs down (when speaking to a professor or her peers) her words would turn shy, flip the page and suddenly she was assertive and confident (this was around Chime.) With Bethany's dialogue taking on so many characteristics it was a little difficult to pin down her ""true self"" (if you catch my drift.)Overall however, (transitions and dialogue discrepancies aside) I thought the story was interesting, definitely original, and a hell of a lot of fun to read (without taking up too much of your time.)I think fantasy lovers will appreciate this one, for the rest of you it might be a hit or miss. (aka it reads mostly fantasy with only appearances of reality to break for Bethany's story structuring.)Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: if you build it they will come.",neutral,book
6380,"If you want something short and hot but don't need or desire a fully fleshed out novel then this would probably be worth buying - it was worth the $1.49 that I paid but I would not have paid full price for this because it was very short and for me - it was not a keeper.  But, it could be considered a review of the writing style of the author and for that it was very good.Pros:- Original concept- Story flows smoothly- Good Sci-Fi plot to it- No major editing problems- High ""heat"" factorCons- Since this was so short, the protagonists fall in lust/love very fast- The villains are mentioned but no interactions take place- World building was good but with it being so short, the reader was left with just a glimpse of it instead of a full view.For me, while I don't reqret reading the story, the novella came off being more of a detailed outline of a good Sci-Fi novel that was put to print before it was fully finished.  The ending was rather abrupt even though it had a HEA.",neutral,book

6441,Agatha is an old maid who loves science. Magnus is a widower who was horribly scarred in the same fire that killed his wife. When they bump into each other (quite literally) at a ball they both are startled by an attraction. When Magnus surprises Agatha with a marriage proposal without a courtship they both have to overcome their insecurities to find love. They keep misinterpreting the behavior of the other and in classic romance novel style it takes them forever to communicate their true feelings. I did like the element of mystery thrown in when it appears that someone is trying to kill Agatha.  There are some discreet love scenes within marriage but it's not explicit. Suggestive but not explicit. By the end I had forgiven the frustrating parts and smiled over the conclusion.,neutral,book

6901,"MACKENZIE'S MAGIC by Linda Howard.STORY BRIEF:Maris is a horse trainer.  Someone plans to harm her favorite horse, and Maris is hit in the head.  She wakes up in a motel room the next day with a concussion.  Mac is with her.  He was recently hired to work with her on the horse farm.  Together they try to figure out what is going on and what to do about it.  Maris has no memory of what she was doing before she was injured.  Maris realizes she is attracted to Mac.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was about half the length of a typical romance novel.  It was a ""falling in lust"" story.  There was no time for any relationship development.  It was shallow.  I wanted more intrique, unique characters, and more interesting plot and dialogue.  But if you loved the series, you might like this out of curiosity.After the mystery and danger is over, a chunk of time is spent with Maris' family in Wyoming.  There is the cute little toddler, all the hunky men, their wives and children.  Everyone is loving and protective.  It was a pleasant time.OTHER BOOKS:There are five Mackenzie books.  The first three were much better than books 4 and 5.  This is book 4.  For a list of my reviews of all five books, see my 5 star review of Burn posted 7-11-09.CAUTION SPOILER:I didn't understand the scene in which Maris was hit in the head (which was told and not shown).  Apparently the bad guy was starting to inject the horse when Maris arrived.  He hits her in the head causing a concussion, but she is able to get on the horse and ride away.  Can one be concussed and still mount and ride?  Why couldn't the bad guy finish the injection as she was mounting?  I wanted more details and showing, not telling.DATA:Kindle count story length: 1462.  Swearing language: mild.  Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: 1, about a page long.

7098,"A lust filled love story wherein one falls in love with the one who kidnaps her.Storyline: Diona and Darlyle Brown are two orphan sisters who lead a modest life in Britain. Darlyle one day suddenly informs her elder sister Diona, that she is going to marry Alexis, the brother of a rich business tycoon Nikias Dranias, and elopes to Greece. Diona sensing trouble immediately shoots off to Greece to save her sister from a disaster. But she gets kidnapped by Nikias and held hostage in his private island, having been mistaken as Darlyle. Her stay in the luxurious island and repeated vigorous sexual encounters with the rich, handsome and sexy Nikias brings her intimacy and ultimately she falls in love with him. Nikias, though initially mistakes her to be a schemer and master sketcher to claim some ransom from him on behalf of her sister, later realizes that Diona came to Greece just to take her sister away from his brother Alexis, and he wrongly kidnapped her instead. Meanwhile Alexis and Darlyle get married and live happily. The true love of Diona is reciprocated by Nikias by not only confessing his love to her but also with an offer to marry her; just at the time when Diona decides to leave Nikias forever, instead of just being his bed partner.Positives: A beautiful soft story to reveal how love between two strangers can be born so suddenly, out of nowhere. Also to elicit that sometimes lust and physical attachment gives way to long lasting love and undoubtedly becomes the binding factor for two people to stay together forever. Very plain and smooth ride through the book. Good enough for a weekend time pass. Love rides though wealth gallops.Negatives: Except for the mistaken kidnap and violent sexual encounters between Nikias and Diona, there are not much twists and turns in the story. Very few rich guys out there nowadays who do not mix love and lust together. Does physical intimacy between a male and female enhance true love? Or does it bring it down?My rating is 3 out of 5",neutral,book

This one the characters just fall short of the mark, and are absolutely unrealistic in the way they take their situation with the amount of stride they take it into it.

When Bailey and a friend go to the club so that Bailey can take her mind off of Aidn, something happens that forces Aidn to admit that Bailey is the woman for him.  There could have been so much more to make this story a very memorable one.  I would like to see this story redone and made into a full length novel.  The heat is definitely there, the love scenes are exciting and sexy.  The potential for backstory and more insight into the other characters was left unexplored.  Overall, the story, for a short one was good, but I was left wanting more.  I will still check out more titles from Lissa Matthews because she really can write the sexiest love scenes, but the story did not come together as a love story for me.

I wouldn't be surprised if it did, considering that the rest of the story is littered with similarly breathtaking descriptions. You can always tell when the writer can actually see the surroundings and the characters. It's even more satisfying when the writer can see it and then paint it so vividly for the rest of us.The connection between the two characters is real and very sweet. The sex scenes are descriptive without ever edging into the vulgarity that is so common in this genre (and if I may say unnecessary). I've read the other reviews and someone complained that there wasn't enough action in the book. I guess if you are looking for an action story, you might be disappointed. I don't think this was the writers purpose in the first place and I don't believe it was advertised as an action book.Now for the bad stuff. Even for fiction, everything about this story is just too convenient. I understand having to neatly tie up the loose ands, but this was knitted so tight it could stop a bullet. Maybe a happy ending is a requirement for a lot of writers, and I'll never be the one to complain about a happily ever after. But, we all know life is messy.

A sweet story with very few twists to the plot, it was exactly what I was in the mood to read - light with a  predictable ending (which isn't a bad thing!) and everyone got what they justly deserved.The reason for the three stars is the explicit descriptions of sexual encounters that seemed to go on for much too long and seemed out of place in a story that is built around an angel, her angel guide and their mission to save someone's mortal soul. This isn't a preachy book - couldn't be considered ""Christian"" in theme, but the sexual explicitness tarnished the sweetness of the story for me. I skipped over a great number of the pages in  order to get to the next scene.There are characters mentioned in the story that were not as fully developed as I would have liked to see. For example, a maid was mentioned as having played an important role in the mortal's childhood experience, but then just disappeared with any resolution.Still an OK read for a lazy summer afternoon! I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it.",neutral,book
7851,"Plot/Story/Characters: 2 StarsThis is a very short story. It felt more like the first couple of chapters of a book rather than a complete story.  It was all about setting up the background for a good yarn, and then it cut short. There was no resolution, the climactic scene was a girl-fight including hair pulling, and there was no character development or growth. Readers were introduced to Zyra and her arch nemesis, then left hanging. It feels like an unfinished story, not a cliffhanger, just not finished. The quest was not completed, no portion of the quest was completed.Writing Style:  4 StarsThe language used was normal for a science fiction novel. It flowed well, and was easily understandable.Overall 3 stars, I wish there had been more to the story it felt so lacking.This book was previously rated at redadeptreviews.com",neutral,book

7892,"I had the sample of this book on my kindle for quite some time and I finally bought it because I've been going on a reading binge lately. Can't get my hands on enough books lately. I'm glad that I read it, because it really is cute and lighthearted. I laughed quite often and kept a grin on my face pretty much the whole time.But I'm seriously disappointed in the price, considering the length. Now, I know I read fairly quickly, but really, even I can't finish most novellas in the hour I take for lunch, which is when I purchased and read this book. For 2.99, I expect it to last longer than my lunch hour, especially considering how many wonderful books I can find that are full length for a dollar more and even some for only .99. Why would I buy this when it offers me so little?Also, I'm disappointed in the amount of errors I found while reading. It's not a serious detractor from the story, but really, an ellipses has three periods, not one. If you're pausing for effect during dialogue, you use an ellipses, which has three, not one. And she does this repeatedly. One period just means that it's the end of a sentence, not a pause. I also found some words that were misspelled, like weak for week and the like.An error or two is fine, we're not perfect and I understand that, but when I'm paying money for something, I expect the author to have at least a pretty good grasp on the language and grammar. I'm tired of commas being in the wrong place, question marks when it should be a period, periods when it should be ellipses. If you don't know your grammar and spelling well, that's when you hire someone to edit it for you. If she did, then she needs to find someone new because who ever did it has a lot to learn.On to the actual story, though. I loved the characters, and I loved how Sean was so good-natured about the whole fiasco, and so willing to go along with everything, and even spurred it on in some parts. I enjoyed listening to each person's point of view and Lily Graison does that well.But because this story was so short, there's very little in the way of true characterization, and there's no real growth between the characters. I found it hard to believe that, even if both had been interested in each other for the last two years like they'd both said, that they would just go ahead and get married.I was also disappointed that we were given such tantalizing hints about Sean's past and why he's usually so grumpy around Christmas, and then were left hanging. We're never given any explanation as to his past, so I felt like that was a frivolous plot point and I hate plot points that go nowhere. It added nothing to the story but extra words, which is sad since this book is so short.  I also found it hard to believe that if Macy had put her foot down, that her mother wouldn't have backed down about the wedding. Some people don't want to get married around the holidays. I certainly don't want to share my anniversary with a holiday. Any mother would have understood had Macy just stood up for herself.Which is also why I was disappointed that their secret was never revealed. While I like the fact that it's a twist, since stories like these usually have the secret come out, I hate that what could have been used for a great growth in character was just left to die like that. Macy should have confessed everything and grown for having learned that lying will always backfire on you. Plus, Macy should have realized that she never should have lied in the first place, because she needed to learn to stand up for herself and let her parents know that she's an adult who has her own choices to make.Plus, I found it hard to believe that the mother would have worried less with Macy moving in with Sean, like Macy lied, since, if I were a mother, I would worry even more, since my daughter is in a different town and now living with someone I'd never even met. And if two years had gone by without me having met that person, I would have not only worried more, but been hurt that my daughter wouldn't have wanted me to meet this person, which is what I would have thought given how long they'd been together and I'd never seen the man.This book could have been wonderful if it had been full length and serious consideration had been given to the characters and their actions. People do things they do for a reason, and if what they do is immature and ultimately selfish, then there needs to be some growth and maturity in the book; otherwise, what's the point? I would have given this two stars, but I ended up with three because, in the end, I did have quite a few laughs, and for a frivolous Christmas story, it was nice. But it was too short and there's so much more that could have been done with it.",neutral,book

Unfortunately Sawyer only saw him as a student and considered him to be off limits, but Harlan was determined to show him otherwise.  Harlan worked his way through college as a male stripper and drawing on that experience he sets into motion a plan to seduce the object of his desire.Sawyer refused to get involve with his student no matter how much he was attracted to him. Even though Harlan will no longer be his student, Sawyer is still hesitant to get involve with him because of his job at the strip club. He was not sure he can handle having his boyfriend lusted after night after night.  When Harlan's persistence wears down Sawyer's resistance will the two be able to sustain a relationship outside of the bedroom?You can Leave Your Hat On is a very hot and sexy story, with a great storyline, but unfortunately I wasn't very taken with the characters. Physically, Sawyer and Harlan were hot together, but outside of the bedroom, I didn't like Sawyer very much.  I found him to be very rude and domineering and I did not like how he treated Harlan.  Actually most of the characters came across as smart mouth and egotistical and that was a bit of a turn off. I also found that the story opened up subplots that left me wondering the outcome, especially where Harlan's brother was concerned.

I think the warden moving Bill to the recycle line was a bit to much of a coincidence and he just happens to be the only one who finds these corporate goodies is a but much.  But understanding the social side of real hackers I could see material like being simply tossed and left out - however secure material from a pharmaceutical company that close to human trial testing phase winding up being sorted by inmates - one who just happens to be a computer nerd with privileges is a stretch.The ending was weak.

8624,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- I love the idea of eternal love and soul mates, and very few storylines can get away with that as easily as the ""werewolf meets his mate"" one. They see each other the first time and just know that they were made for each other. (see cons below also)- The characters are cheesy and stereotypical, but I must admit to finding a guilty sort of pleasure in reading about small, victimized men who are rescued by their heroic, strapping lovers. Sasha is THE stereotype of a helpless damsel in distress like those so popular in the bodice-ripping romances of years ago. And Vadim is, of course, the perfect Alpha. Strong and imposing yet utterly selfless and kind. He's quick to anger, but only when someone's being taken advantage of or he discovers injustice in the world.- There's never a shortage of action and drama in Glenn's stories. The characters get over one hurdle, have sex, get over another hurdle, have sex, misread each other and separate, make up and have sex, and so on.- This story takes the mental communication between werewolf mates to a deeper level than I've seen in other stories. I liked not only seeing Vadim and Sasha carry on entire conversations no one else can hear, but also seeing other mated couples engaged in discussions no one else is privy to and having to guess at what they're saying based on their body language.CONS:- As much as I love stories about werewolves and their life mates, the idea that a character can meet someone and automatically be in love with him seems to me like a lazy storytelling technique sometimes. The author doesn't have to put any effort into establishing an emotional connection or building up sexual tension. It's just there. Bang. In this story, the characters have performed the mating ritual (which is basically akin to marriage, with no option of divorce) before Sasha even knows Vadim's name.- The writing tends to be shallow and repetitive sometimes. This occurs near the beginning, for example: ""The little man was his now""...and then a few paragraphs later: ""The sexy man beneath the desk was no longer theirs. He belonged to Vadim now.""- The whole book reads like a first draft that was written in about 2 weeks and then never edited. There are obvious editing errors throughout, and the story incorporates a large number of clich&eacute;s and hackneyed phrases. Some of the typos are so blatant it seems like the author didn't even read the story over before it was published, much less an editor.Overall comments: Glenn's stories have a tendency toward over-the-top drama, as is evident at the end of the first paragraph of this story: the two main guys meet and immediately recognize that they're mates, and Vadim is ""stunned!"" (I didn't add the exclamation point; it's in the book.) But I keep reading her stories, because in spite of their soap-opera feel, they're entertaining little diversions.",neutral,book

With just one glance, Quinton knows that Regina, the wife, is the woman of his dreams.  The only problem is that Wayne Templeton owns the logging company that Quinton is working with and the fact that Wayne, with his money and respect, basically owns the town.  Quinton doesn't know how Regina feels about him so he goes about finding out.  They decide to meet for dinner the next night and they both feel an attraction for one another.  So while Regina's husband, Wayne is out of town, she and Quinton carry on a loose affair, trying not to be noticed.  Then trouble begins.  Someone has been vandalizing areas of the mill and someone is setting Quinton up for it.  While avoiding the town cops, Quinton and Regina's relationship intensifies, especially when Quinton learns that Wayne is verbally, physically, and emotionally abusive to Regina.  He only wants to take her away from such a horrible husband.The story comes to a peak when the cops come to Quinton's door with evidence that Quinton has done the vandalizing.  Quinton isn't guilty but the problem is that Regina is his alibi.  Needing to work things out in his head, he escapes to the nearby American Indian reservation that Quinton grew up on.  Quinton has been away for a long time but his aunt takes him in and gives counsel as to what he should do about his problems.  He needs to talk to Regina.The closing of the story is where I don't want to give spoilers but the reader finds out who is doing the vandalism when the last act is a huge one.  Quinton doesn't want to lose Regina, he wants to be her white night.  With the cops still thinking he is the perpetrator, he walks right up to the cops and is arresting right away.I don't normally read this kind of romance novel, but it was a freebie on Amazon so I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did.  There was some depth to the story.  Much more so than the Harelequin Romances of old.  The characters could have been more fleshed out and there were a few typos that need editing, but I did like the story.  I found myself rooting for Quinton and Regina.  It was hard to believe that they weren't caught by someone seeing them out, but they weren't.  I do have to mention that the ending was highly unbelievable and disappointing. But now that I have invested myself into this story, I want a sequel to see if the author can redeem the terrible ending to this story.

It's not that it's poorly written. On the contrary Kessler can write and write well. His tale is just hard to swallow and gets progressively less digestible the more you consume of it. The story finally degenerates into the realm of the absurd.A fiction author has a responsibility to do his or her homework, and Kessler frequently fails in this respect. He obviously doesn't know much about firearms and demonstrates this ignorance in his confusion between an automatic pistol and a revolver (the former ejects shell casings while the latter retains them in each of the six chambers). He also knows little of hand-to-hand fighting, having a lightweight woman being able to head-butt and punch-out a burly prison guard.

8779,"When Rebecca Hamilton steps off the stagecoach in tiny Gardiner, Texas she's not sure what to expect.  The plain,  spinsterish young woman from Massachusetts has come to claim the inheritance left to her by her aunt, but what exactly that inheritance entails is rather vague.  Gardiner's sheriff, Adam Caldwell, wastes no time in setting Rebecca straight:  She is now the new ""Madam"" of the town's only house of ill repute.  Since Rebecca is clearly not Madam material and Adam could really use a wife, the solution seems simple - Adam proposes.  But after years of taking care of her overbearing father Rebecca is in no hurry to tie herself to yet another man who is just looking for someone to cater to his every whim.  So Rebecca decides to try her new life on for size, and assumes the persona of ""Miss Becky"".  There's just one little problem...Miss Becky can't seem to resist the town's  temperamental sheriff, and Adam prefers plain old Rebecca to her flashier alter ego.I'm always singing Shannon Stacey's praises, but I felt kind of neutral about this one.  I found these characters very one dimensional.  Rebecca's lightening fast transformation from nave and virginal to faux-prostitute was really ridiculous, and the running joke about Adam just needing to shoot someone to blow off some steam got old real fast.  The whole story is very reminiscent of those cheesy, campy western movies and television programs that were so popular in the late 60's/early 70's.  I can almost picture the silly costumes and the fake looking scenery!  Wait!  Do I hear the theme music from Bonanza playing in the background?  I just know that Hoss and Little Joe are around her somewhere...While this one wasn't a good ""fit"" for me, there's no denying that the author really does write quite well.  The pacing is good and the dialog is nicely done.  I think the key to enjoying this is to go into it knowing what you're going to get:  a very light, fluffy romance that's historical in name only.While this is a follow-up to another book set in Gardiner, Texas -Taming Eliza Jane, you won't be lost if you don't read them in order.Occasional strong language and some sexual content.",neutral,book

8848,"`Ashes' is a collection of 6 tales of horror packed with thrills and chills accompanied by a fantastic essay exploring horror as it is perceived within the film and publishing industries. Written by Jonathan Maberry, this introduction spoke of the slow distillation of the genre by which slasher and thriller films/stories taint/dilute the brand and served as the perfect entree to the pure horror stories penned by Scott Nicholson. `Ashes' kicks off with `Homecoming' a spooky and heartfelt ghost story where a farmer's son (along with other sprits) returns from the dead for one conversation. The next, `Haunted' - surreal and suspenseful, full of dread and awkward wonder in which the inhabitants of a once burnt out home are haunted by the people who fell victim to the flames. `The Christening' tells the short tale of abandoned mother to be in isolation both in geographically and emotionally who is haunted by an unusual spirit on a farm - so well defined and atmospheric that I could smell the drew on the cool grass amongst the farm backdrop. `She Climbs a Winding Stair' is a ghost story (see the reoccurring theme here?) of a beauty lost at seas who comes ashore seeking souls to accompany her in the murky ocean depths. Set amongst a ghost story isolated on an inhibited island, this was by far the best story in the collection. Rounding out the collection `Must See to Appreciate' is real-estate horror which throws in a moment of horror before an abrupt end, and `Three Dollar Corpse' which, much like `...Winding Stair' is a favourite of the collection set in a civil war prison camp where inmates make a living by burying the dead and scavenging their possessions. All in all a very solid collection sure to entertain and scare the reader just enough to keep things interesting - 3.5 stars.",neutral,book

And the back and forth between Jesse and Sarah just made my head hurt not want for more.  But even with all the switches between hating each other and being in love I could have like this book if I had known what the auther was saying.  Even having a dictionary on the kindle doesn't make it easy to look up all the different words used, in the end I just made up my own meanings for the words.  I really think that if the auther used less language came back down to earth and remembered the words used by everyday people he/she could write a really good book.",neutral,book
8908,"Denise A. Agnew, &lt;strong>The Hot Zone, vol. 1: Male Call&lt;/strong> (Samhain Publishing, 2007)One of those crazy-coincidences erotic romances where the lovely lady has been missing her man (who didn't know about her feelings for him, while all the while he's been lusting after her, and doesn't it strike anyone else as annoying that the single worst thing about &lt;em>Gone with the Wind&lt;/em>, the fact that the entire final two hours of the movie could have been dispensed with given one honest two-minute conversation between Scarlett and Rhett, is the one thing romance wirters are so enamored of?) is surprised by him showing up at a ridiculously incredible place, in this case getting back from Iraq and being manipulated by some well-meaning friends into appearing at a strip club. Yes, folks, you heard that right.

8928,"Surrender is the first book in Lora Leigh Bound Hearts series, it was interesting. Cole is a dominating sexual man who knows what he wants and will do anything to get it. Tess is a smart strong woman who happens to be sexually repressed. She also harbors a lot of guilt about things that she wants because of her mother. Tess goes to spend some time at her fathers' house and when she gets there she ends up being tied to a bed by Cole. Cole and Tess have a lot of sex and begin to bond. Problems with their chosen lifestyle come in to play when Tess's mom shows up and finds out what is going on. The sex in this book is hot and has some BDSM in it along with a threesome. The writing was ok, but I felt that certain points lagged and I didn't feel like either of the characters was really that emotionally attached to each other. Other than those few problems I did enjoy the book.",neutral,book

I had a hard time following the characters because they had a past that wasn't explained it was inferred that the reader knew the characters from the prior series and now a new series is breaking off from it.SPOILERSDover an owl shifter  (hero) is asked to research trouble in Baniff,  it seems Leopards, and wolves are causing trouble. He is asked to take Dana with him, a Leopard shifter who wants to get away from competing males. As they arrive in town tension is high and not everyone is happy to see an Owl and Leopard together even if they are just friends. The sexual tension is high with Dover and Dana, though Dover is refusing Dana's advances believing spices should stay with their own - friendship ok, mates NO.They see a group of owls and one Lana (H) makes a pass at Dover never believing he was going to call her on it.Lana is the youngest of her family and is well protected. The owls are being pushed out by the Leopards, but as a passive species they start to manipulate the Leopards, Wolves, and humans around them.Lana and Dover meet and begin a steamy relationship, Dover believes he has found his mate while Lana believes he is being pressured by her brothers to be with her. Dover discovers the trouble in Baniff, is all about a new Leopard pride moving in on Owl land, with more Leopards than Owls the Owls will lose the home that has been part of them for several generations. Lana's brothers confess that yes they manipulated the Leopards and wolves but to save the lands for their families. Lana doesn't believe it was in the best interest as some have died and many more harmed because of the lies.Dover is able to prove that the Leopards were trying to push the Owls out he is able to convince the Leopard to move on to another town with more land, and available property.He and Lana make-up and he plans to take her to his home to show her to his friends and family.This is great start to an exciting new series, Lorie O'Clare never seems to miss, and I only wish they weren't so short. Though this was a free download, I would caution readers in purchasing as the next in the series at $5.80 and less than 200pgs.I would recommend Shelly Laurenston - Pack Challenge, Magnus, and Pride series all are with Alpha Males and down and dirty Alpha Females.Enjoy and Keep Reading !!!",neutral,book

9008,"This was a good book and I got it when it was free. There are just a few bad things I have to say about this book. The author used the word ""mocking"" waaaaay too much. She also was too descriptive about eyes or facial features. To describe them once or twice is fine but when you describe them over and over and over again, it gets to be too much for me. I started to skip over the parts like that. The other thing I didn't like about this book was that the dialog from both characters was in the same paragraph so at times it made it difficult to figure out who said what.I did enjoy the story line though.",neutral,book
9009,"An editor (or even just proof-reading) would take this book a long way.  Sorcha has good ideas but tends to plagiarize her own books, sometimes copying full paragraphs, and has such poor editing that it is very difficult to overlook.  After reading the other books in this series, I was happy to see how things turned out with Ash, but there wasn't much 'new' to this book other than a history lesson in Hinduism.  I ended up skipping over several paragraphs and pages because it went on and on about the history of Hinduism.

The book is complex in the layering of the characters and subject matter with separation being forefront.Margaret Atwood's book has been compared to the likes of Jack Kerouac's On the Road, and to Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, and rightfully so. A fair comparison of this essay, Stopping the World, to Atwood's book would be like an essay on Herman Melville's Moby Dick with the contents of said essay stating that Moby Dick is about about a man and a fish. While true at a elementary level, would completely miss the point and that is my conclusion with this essay. it seems to completely miss the point of Atwood's message.However I must give merit for an imaginative piece that does try to make apple juice out of oranges.",neutral,book

Too little plot, too little character development, etc. horribly rushed, but, one has to be mindful that this is a short story from the Mammoth Book of Vampire Romance.

When he went into heat, she was the first one to raise her hand to help.  Even though she is also a Tyger, she has no experience with heat, and soon finds herself with more than she may be able to handle.The story line is definately something I was attracted to.  This is an Erotic story, so if you are looking for a light romance, it's not the story for you.  There is a lot of sex of course, because after all, Tyron is in heat, and that's what he needs.Calla and Tryon do have chemistry, but for me it wasn't enough to see them together long term.  The bomb seemed more of a distraction than anything, and I don't think there was enough time spent developing the relationship between the two main characters.  That's really why I gave this story three stars, I also felt that it was a bit choppy in the writing style.  This writer does show a lot of promise though, so I will keep an eye out for her later books.",neutral,book

9499,"When Catch Me If You Can came up for review on another site that I review books for, I eagerly snatched it up. Although I've never read anything by Ms. Gregg before, I'd heard her name mentioned by several people whose opinions I value and they've all lauded her work. So, I read it and . . . it was a nice read.The dialogue was witty and fun. And I felt sorry for Caesar who seemed to have the weight of the world on his shoulders. I appreciated the way he never bitched and moaned about all these problems that were heaped up on him. He didn't sit down and have a pity party like so many characters often do. He just jumped in and tried to find solutions, in his unique and odd way which added to the charm of Catch Me If You Can.The mystery inside Catch Me If You Can seemed to be more of a comedy of errors instead of anything serious or focused. To give a good comparison, I felt like I was watching Ethel and Lucy from I Love Lucy. I don't know if this is because of what I do in my day-to-day job, but I was seriously annoyed that no one called the police or anything. Their reasoning behind not doing so was flimsy and didn't ring true. I freely admit that this may be a bias on my part since I interact with the police on a daily basis.The relationship between Caesar and Dan was nice. The respect they had for each other had the makings to develop into something more powerful as time goes on, but I would've liked to see a little more depth between the two of them. There were so many secondary characters that Caesar and Dan's developing relationship didn't appear to be the focal point of Catch Me If You Can. I missed that, I wanted to see Dan and Caesar develop and struggle through their trust issues to see if they'd make a go at it. This was barely glanced at.Overall Catch Me If You Can is a fun and breezy read. You'll laugh out loud several times at some of the dialogue. While I love lite books, I felt that the comedy aspect overwhelmed the development of Caesar and Dan's relationship, which in my humble opinion should've been the focal point.COURTESY of CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES",neutral,book

No matter what, I've enjoyed all of her stories, but the differentiator between I like her story and I love her story is definitely the length.  Both of her full length novels as part of this Karmic Consultants series are five stars.  This story is actually the first in the series and is not required to enjoy the others, but it provides a nice background and introduction to important characters.Lucy Cartwright is essentially a counselor for ghosts.  She helps them resolve their issues and to accept that they are dead so they can move on to the white light.  Unfortunately, you don't get to pick which ghosts come to you and since Lucy has been going through a dry spell romantically, she apparently is broadcasting her horniness to the dead.  This means that every horn dog ghost with unfulfilled sexual fantasies are visting Lucy with the hopes she'll be able to fulfill their cravings.  Of course it doesn't work that way and she can't even touch the ghosts, but she calls her boss Karma to see what she can do and Karma advises that she needs to get laid.The next day, Lucy is dragged out of bed by the pounding on her front door to find a strange, but hunky man on her doortstep and it's lust at first sight.  He introduces himself as Cox and tells her Karma sent him over so Lucy is mortified thinking Karma has sent her a gigolo to help her with her problem.  The thought of paying for sex is debilitating for only so long before she rationalizes she needs to get over her morals and succomb to temptation.  While she's entertaining fantasies in her head, the conversation gets a little awkward and it turns out that Cox is actually private investigator Jake Cox, Karma's brother, and he's there because Karma had a vision that a man who was recently murdered would be visiting her that evening.  Jake is investigating his murder and trying to track down evidence that will bring the murderer into custody.  Jake and Lucy have to wait it out together with the strain of their attraction since Lucy has to remain horny if she wants the ghost to show up.This story was fast paced with laugh out loud moments, but a whole lot less beleiveable, yes even with ghosts, than a full length novel where characters get a little more depth or there's more than your hookup within moments of meeting one another.  Although Lucy and Jake move on to be recurring characters in future books and actually a focal point for book 3, The Sexorcist, there really isn't much development of their relationship here beyond the physical.  Still, it's a light enjoyable escape and a great foundation for books 2 & 3.",neutral,book

After they interview several horrid candidates they open the door to a young woman who'd fallen off her bicycle before showing up for her interview. Just one look at her and both men fall for the innocent girl and are determined to make her theirs.  Soon, Susie's cooked and cleaned her way into their hearts and what starts as merely some sensual fun turns into a desire for something much more.Susie's Choice was an interesting read. One thing's for sure, it was definitely a scorching hot read. But I just couldn't bring myself to like any of the characters. Susie's father treated her deplorably and she really didn't say anything in her defense. Even her brothers took her for granted, all demanding she cook and clean for them, having no life of her own.Christian's constant telling Joel he loved him, with no response in return was disheartening and almost seemed desperate. Joel's cowardice in not telling Christian he loved him went beyond his fear of being hurt. It smacked almost of manipulation, which lowered his stature in my eyes.While the sex between the two men as well as the three of them was undeniably hot, it seemed there were more pages of sex than there were of plot.  It got to the point that I really felt I knew nothing about the characters and wasn't sure if I wanted to. If you're interested in a story filled with almost nothing but sex and a token Happily Ever After, Susie's Choice might be something you'd be interested in reading. If, however, you want a story with any sort of character development and emotional depth, you might want to give this one a pass.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews.",neutral,book

It is basically the same book.  It did keep me reading and I finished it, I was a little disappointed in the end but it was worth reading.Cons: 1. The rape scenes were disturbing because there were so many of them and graphic.  2. She gave away the plot at the beginning of the book and it was not a surprise when it was revealed. I don't know if this was purposeful or overlooked by accident but anyway I would have enjoyed it more not knowing who the ""bad guy"" was from the beginning. 3.

I think sometimes when you try to write a story in a short number of pages or words, it is typically difficult to fully express the characters and get the plot flowing well.

10272,"This has potential to be an interesting book, but not as it now stands. The book has purportedly been ""edited"" since the original self-publication date so I assume I was reading the ""improved"" version. The story premise is of a dystopean world divded into the Citizen's Haven where the privileged reign supreme and a slum-like underworld where the unwanted live in the shadows and risk being turned into lobotomized slaves by the Citizens. The author had me from the word dystopia, but syntax errors and awkward, juvenile word choices really took away most of the pleasure of reading it. I'm thankful that the majority of typos referred to in previous reviews were cleaned up or I couldn't have gotten to the end. Still, it was slow going. There are some interesting ideas in the book. I enjoyed the suspense around the character Jeffrey and cared what happened to him. I would have liked Kaylee better had she not been so one-dimensional. Her character lacked subtlety and substance. I found Jeffrey and Michaels and maybe Malcolm to be the only characters who showed some realistic complexity and thus earned my interest. I wanted to care about Kaylee as there was ample opportunity in the frightening and gritty circumstances she found herself in to really make me care, but the lack of development of her character had me rolling my eyes at times. She was too reactive, a cardboard cut-out of a tough young girl survivor, lacking a level of tenderness or vulnerability or emotionl substance that would have made her likeable or even believeable.  Most of the other characters need some work, too, to give them some dimension and the storyline more credibility.  I imagine I would have enjoyed this book had the author hired a professional editor to really edit the issues of syntax and to provide guidance in fleshing out the characters..  For the author: It would really help your English-speaking readers enjoy your written word if you would invest in a real editor. Great as a first draft; a bit tedious as a finished product.",neutral,book

10295,"Werewolf Thomas is on a cross-country trip to get some time for himself. He comes across a small young man being accosted by bullies in an alley, and steps in to save him. That's how he meets Micah. Micah is his mate, the person fate has destined for him, and Thomas naturally feels an irresistible attraction to him. Thomas makes love to him, claims him by biting him (cementing the mating bond), and convinces Micah to come back to his ranch with him. He figures he'll explain the whole ""werewolf"" thing later.On the road back though, they're accosted by gay bashers. When you're human, you really don't want to threaten a werewolf's mate, and Thomas soon as them beaten silly. When a neighboring pack is called in to do cleanup and discredit the bashers, the sheriff, Caleb, turns out to be a werewolf, an Alpha of his own pack, and *also* recognizes Micah as his mate. It turns out Micah is a tri-omega, a rare Omega werewolf that has *two* mates. Caleb doesn't want to share, Thomas doesn't either but realizes he must, and the three head back to Caleb's pack to try to form a trinity together.My problem with the story is that Caleb is a total jerk. He has little to no empathy for Micah. When Micah gets frustrated and overwhelmed with emotion from the negative feelings pack members give him, he leaves the house against Caleb's orders, and Caleb makes it clear to him that if he ever disobeys him again, he'll take it as a personal challenge. A challenge to a werewolf is a fight to the death. So in essence, Caleb is telling Micah that he's to stay and obey him... or die. Hardly loving and worthy of having mate. I felt Thomas should have been appalled at that behavior. Even though they're both mated to Micah, he should have been quick to jump and let Caleb know that he would never allow Caleb to threaten him. Thomas is a mate too and will fight to the death to protect his mate. He should have made Caleb realize that Micah was basically uprooted from his entire life and is now being treated as a prisoner, of course it's going to take some adjustment time. And even if they're werewolves with their own, they also live in modern society and are not foreign to the concept of individual's rights. Eventually, everything works out, but the bad taste left in my mouth from such boorish and threatening behavior from Caleb marred an otherwise totally enjoyable story.Still, if you've read the other Wolf Creek Pack and Tri-Omega series, it's worth it to read this one too. It does have some very romantic and sexy qualities, and there's many good moments.",neutral,book

10494,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Thank you to the author for her generosity.Aislinn is a child of almost eight who wants nothing more than to become a lady knight. We follow her on her journey. I enjoyed the strength and perserverance which is shown through out the story as the girl pursues her goal.Despite that, I was left feeling that something was missing during the novel. I never fully got a sense that Aislinn&#8217;s hardships and troubles on her path to becoming a knight was anything more than minor irritants. The scene, of the young pages going on a bandit raid, stretched the bounds of credulity. The love story had all the usual twists of two people who eventually manage to marry.A side plot which was started, was left hanging. I can only hope it is further explained in later books. Half-way through the book, the would be lady knight starts to have visions of her brother, whereby it seems the author is trying to bring a stronger religious presence into the novel. She also attempts to add an element of magic, another bit that also doesn&#8217;t go very far. The threat of war along with the subsequent battle, and the near loss of Aislinn&#8217;s husband, was a let down.There are also proof-reading mistakes that don&#8217;t seem to have been corrected.  Mainly, the misuse of certain words that while spelled correctly, change the meaning of the sentence.  All in all, I kept expecting more and ended up disappointed.",neutral,book

The characters are both semi-flawed in their own ways, however, easily overcome by the characters.  The sister seems interesting but we get very little from her in the story other than to illustrate how polar opposite she is from the main character.  The hero of the story has limited dialog and you get limited insight into his thoughts or feelings.

10641,"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsA semi interesting back-story and I didn't care for the writing style. For some reason I had expected something way more intense since there seems to be so much buzz about the Lords of the Underworld series. To me the writing seemed kind of amateurish. I'm going to give the rest of the books a chance though because I did buy The Darkest Fire as part of a Lords of the Underworld bundle package and I am curious on the relevance of this prequel.Regarding the hero in the story, as admirable as Geryon was, the description of hooves, fur and horns was a big turn off. I just wasn't feeling the draw at all. Even creepy as he seemed more animal than human.The idea that Pandora's box was built from a Goddess' bones was really cool and I think that I may have enjoyed The Darkest Fire more if I had read it after the first book in the series, The Darkest Night. Perhaps I could have appreciated the importance of Pandora's box more. As for the The Darkest Fire being a stand alone little story; I'd not suggest reading it alone and then giving up. More forward with The Darkest Night and then make your decision if you liked it or not. Since I went ahead and read The Darkest Night right away, that moved my rating for this book from a 2 to a 3.

They story had a very interesting premise, but it was not fleshed out into the full story it deserved.  The shortness of the story makes Aislinn's capitulation a little too quick even though you know they have been working together for 6 months already.

10780,"Sometimes I can spend a stupid amount of time browsing through books on Amazon and I am always on the lookout for new authors with good write ups. This is how I came across Grant McKenzie as I noticed his debut novel had pretty good write ups.I had zero expectations, as normal with new authors and was pleased that as I started reading it was very easy to get into the story. As the synopsis explains and the story starts out, ordinary guy Sam White leaves his job early one morning and arrives home to find his house burnt to the ground. He then receives a call from a man claiming his family are safe and will be returned to Sam if he complies with the killer.Due to the story itself it certainly doesn't take long to get into the story as there is quite a lot of action in the first few chapters. I liked the style of writing by Grant McKenzie as he seems to follow the same route as authors such as Simon Kernick which are sometimes short snappy chapters. Although that may be true, there was a certain element missing which made me feel there was something lacking. I just couldn't quite put my finger on what.The story itself had all the right ingredients and the writing was good, but for some reason I just didn't like the characters all that much. The further I got into the story, the more I felt like I had `read this type of thing before'. Admittedly I do read a lot of books but this storyline just had too much of a familiar ring to it.Don't get me wrong, I certainly enjoyed the book, but it didn't leave a lasting enough impression on me to really stand out from the crowd. On reflection, I think this time around maybe I relied too heavily on other readers opinions and maybe I just didn't feel as strongly as others did. I certainly wouldn't be put off reading another McKenzie novel and I am hoping that maybe with a more original storyline I will like his next book more, but for some reason this one just didn't grab me all that much.Overall certainly not a bad book, just one that didn't have that certain something!",neutral,book

10839,"While this was a quick overview of the Oldest City in the United States, founded September 8, 1565, I questioned that so many historical events happened in the remainder of that year alone. That aside, the book was a nice overview of St. Augustine.As a native and lifelong resident, I'm well versed in the history of St. Augustine having my own library dedicated only to the city, so I do not make this statement lightly.Yes, St. Augustine is beautiful and many times it's said that it looks more European than anything else except, of course, Disney World.  People tend to visit Orlando, then come to St. Augustine with visions of the 'magical' world and unfortunately think Castillo de San Marcos was a replica of 'a castle' built only for their enjoyment.  (It was built 1672-1695.)St. Augustine is a living, thriving city with all kinds of vehicles, tour busses, cars, trucks, RV's, everything imaginable, so obey the laws just like you would in your own hometown, such as crossing at crosswalks, looking both ways before crossing. The usual.  Park at the VIC with convenient and reasonable price and walk, not driving by and just looking.  In the most congested area of the city, the downtown area where many sites are located, there are homes where real people live, and businesses, all real, not posing for 'color.'Locals, including tour guides, are gracious, welcoming and courteous just because that's who we are.  Come and admire all the lovely architecture, the Plaza, the Oldest House and of course, Castillo de San Marcos.The sketches in the book add to the word whimsy in the title, but come see for yourself and get the timelines, 'up close and personal.'

10914,"The second book in the In Her Name series has me left in a bit of a quandary. I honestly feel like this story didn't know what it wanted to be. A cold war epic? A social commentary? A mythological & mystical journey? All of the above? There's a lot in here but it just didn't feel cohesive to me.When reading about the spy situation on the ground with Valentina, I really liked it. When delving into the political dance between the Confederation & St. Petersburg over where the coal ash & nuclear weapons were & how Riga factored in, was enjoyable. Tesh-Dar's quest & angst for a successor just seemed really disconnected from everything, including the battle the Kreelans are bringing to bear on St. Petersburg. As with the first book, there were some convenient turns (so much so that I was disappointed that I was correct in having guessed them ***SPOILER***Sato has fatal radiation poisoning so the Kreelan save him with their super healing gel in the middle of a battle where they're bent on killing a multitude of humanity for the glory of the Empress... because he's ""The Messenger"". The point that the Messengers are so very revered has been made since book 1 so I'm wondering why the Kreelan seem so confused by Sato's reactions to their repeatedly singling him out to save while he watches his fellow humans slaughtered & left for dead. Surely, past Messengers the Kreelan have run into have had similar reactions over the thousands of cycles the war & decimations have been waged.I still need to know more about the Kreelan but so far they, Tesh-Dar especially, just seem so surface & flat they aren't reading as ""real"" to me. Li'ara went a bit deeper what with all her introspection in this book & I really began to care but overall, the Kreelan leave me wanting. I mean, I get it. Epic warrior society, prophecy, destiny, Bloodsong, invincible & they make it all look good because they do everything with a dash of beauty to the glory of the Empress, while being all blue & badass. But it's not making me deeply empathetic to their plight. The only thing that makes that somewhat okay is that with the exception of a few ""special"" humans, the rest are dispatched relatively quickly & aren't written in a way that even if you liked them, you much mourn them. I wanted this to read like BSG but on a character empathy level, it's just not there. On the upside, St. Petersburg fared somewhat better than Keran in that they weren't left to utter decimation as sport to the Kreelan & left behind by humanity after the big battle.There were long expository re-introductions to characters met in book 1, right in the midst of conversations that really broke continuity & seemed like unnecessary filler. Possibly it's just me though, I read the first book recently so I didn't need to be reintroduced to these people in depth. Honestly, I'm still interested in where this is going & I do like the political & diplomatic backdrop of this series, I think the story quite shines there, so I'll definitely go to the next. My understanding from the reviews I've seen is that for those who've read the original trilogy, it's fantastic but I can't help feeling that I should be able to pick up a series at what is its actual beginning & feel the epic.",neutral,book

Well, we don't really know because the story just ended before finishing the plot line!As much as I enjoyed the story, I would recommend waiting to see if there is a second one before reading it.

This of course doesn't prevent Irial from visiting her or Niall from calling her on the phone a lot.  Leslie I don't think realizes yet that she won't be able to move on.  She has a choice that she won't make, she can't touch Irial without fatal consequences, and to be with Niall means she has to become one of the monsters in the Dark Court, either way she loses who she is.I really enjoyed the story, I'm one of the fans that don't mind branching out with different characters, in fact I hadn't read about Leslie since Ink Exchange, so I was very pleased Melissa Marr gave us this two part story.

So in the midst of the story there is a bunch of sex think, a little sex but mostly just wishing. So this one has Maggie and Erik, along with Jared and TJ, going to the Wolf Games, an Olympics type event for wolves, and forces Maggie to take a hard look at herself.

It stars a kick-ass protagonist dealing with the good and the bad of various paranormal players, and taking the lead in trying to stop a super-powerful evil adversary who threatens both the paranormal and mundane worlds.  Unfortunately, the editing was horrid.  The story abounds with misspelled words, missing words, duplicated words, missing or incorrect punctuation, gramatical errors, and so on, to the point that the story was often difficult to follow.  Consequently, neither did the plot move forward as smoothly, nor were the characters developed as fully, as the author no doubt intended.

11427,"This is a review of the three books that currently comprise this series so please apply to all of them.First, If I could have  I would have rated this series at 3.5 stars, rounding down I gave it three but it is worth reading if you like the military science fiction genre. If it had better characterization and editing I might have given it four stars. The writer may be a new author? My recommendation is to buy the trilogy which is available as single download.There are some very creative elements in these books as far as tactics and political structure goes, but there are some real leaps of faith around the structure of the formation of a global response here on Earth.This is old fashioned science fiction where one man and heroic effort by a team of no nonsense military men deliver nearly impossible results in next to no time. You will read some political posturing based on today's situation and you may be tempted to stereotype the authors political views but don't be too quick to judge.Now the story, it is a fast based space opera with elements of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the beautiful alien princess and archaic code of honor, E.E. Smith, the rapacious and clearly evil alien races (no, not as bad as the Chlorans or Boskone) but it is easy to identify the villains, both aliens and humans and often the human villains come across as worse than theThe hero is one Alexander Thorson, an ex-NFL player, ex-Air Force pilot and actually an ex-lots of things. Alexander is blessed with the physical capabilities of an older NFL player and a unique view of tactics, inter-species psychology as well as an interesting fount of experience.The first book introduces us to Alexander as a victim, a captive of aliens right out of Area 51 and his unique approach and quick thinking in this circumstance and the further adventures he has with other aliens sets the stage for the entire series of three books. Lots of battles, personal hardships overcome, a love story, bad aliens and crooked Terran's to overcome,  what more do you want?",neutral,book
11451,This book was okay for a short story.  I guess if I had to have waited months in between each book I would have liked it better.  But since I am reading them straight through it seemed like an unnecessary break from the action.  I did like how it was to the point with very little resistance to falling in love by the characters.  No time for that. I would ultimately recommend it as a free ebook or if you borrowed it from the library.,neutral,book

11515,This book is exactly what you expect. There are no suprises.  The book is good if you just need to read but has some limitations that were expected and came true.  The books in this series have been good but this is the least favorite for me.,neutral,book

I don't mind the bondage but it wasn't believable to me that Ty and Gwen were trying to write a script  based off her book about sex/ bondage and Ty think it's going to be a movie that people will take him seriously in Hollywood.I know when to releax and not read too much into fiction because when I read I want to be taken away beyond the norm.

11658,"Reviewed by Nadine for My Secret Romance Book ReviewsThis book was provided by the author/publisher in return for an honest review.Ashamed, Tess Delacourte has ran from the dark, sexual desires that lie within her.  Her parents divorced due to her mother's inability to handle her father's depraved needs.  The apple doesn't fall far from the tree however.  Tess is a woman wanting and needing to be dominated.Ever since Cole Andrews cornered her at a party and let her know explicitly what he wanted to do to her, she hasn't been able to get him out of her mind.  She is well aware of the rumors of his sexual escapades and dominance.  But she's afraid of both him and herself.  Is she truly her father's daughter?Tess promised to spend the week at her father's estate for an upcoming party.  However, after arriving and settling in she learns her father and step-mother are out of town.  Cole has arranged to spend the week alone with Tess.  She can no longer hide and avoid him.  But, she won't give into him so easily.  She taunts him before heading up to her room for the night.  Tess awakens to find herself bound in her bed with a very naked Cole sitting next to her.Cole has let Tess run long enough.  His patience has worn out.  He is going to make her face her desires and accept what she needs.  He's warned her.  She is well aware of what he wants from her.  What he needs from her.Surrender is book 1 in the Bound Hearts series.  It's a very short read, but if anyone is familiar with Lora Leigh you know it's a hot one.  Tess loves Cole, but fears she'll just be another body in the bed to him.  With that in mind she dives in and faces her deepest desires.  Putting her trust in Cole, Tess finds the strength within herself to accept what she wants and what Cole has to offer.  These two are hot together.  I wish the story was longer, but it was a great introduction to the series.",neutral,book
11718,"This book was 73 pages on my Nook, but for a short story a lot of detail was packed into it.  It definately gave me an interest in the rest of the series.  I loved that Robyn was deaf.  I think that was so different from any other book.  I really liked that Robyn and Keil were equals.  Overall a good quick read.",neutral,book
11740,"Okay so the only reason this book got 3 stars was because, while I didn't really enjoy this book I did however enjoy the series as a whole.I think that this was the worst one of the series.  But don't let it discourage you from reading the rest of the Biting Love series because the rest are full of humor, wit, steamy love scences, and somewhat of a mystery.",neutral,book
11777,"Good for all you conspiracy theorists, of course. In this case, however, I'm on your side. A short, fast read, it lays out very clearly why world governments would want to hide this sort of information, and presents one of the real reasons, not one I'd thought of before, as to why they'll probably always continue to do so (I won't spoil things by telling you what that is; read it and find out).",neutral,book
11779,"This was overall a sweet story, a story about finding love again after losing your first love.  There is not a lot of plot going or character development.  Story was fairly short, I finished it in a sitting.  This is the story of Sophia and Ethan.  Sophia was married to Dan for over 20 years and Dan died two years ago.  Ever since his death, Ethan, Dan's best friend and business partner becomes close to Sophia and her daughter. He is secretly lusting and loving Sophia but is afraid of telling her.  She has become close to Ethan over the last few months.  She would have been lost if not for his friendship and support.Typical story of man that has always felt something special for his best friend's wife but never got too close until after his friend dies and is time for Sophia to move on. Sophia was scared of things she was feeling for her husband's best friend.  She needed to escape and decides to go on a cruise by herself to clear her head and be away.  Turns out Ethan wouldn't let her go without him and shows up at the ship surprising her.You can probably guess the ending from there on.

11957,"Overall this was a fairly enjoyable book. It's a pretty standard high fantasy experience that you find so much of now. It has all the basic elements that were set by Tolkien: the journey and the coming together of different races to finish a task that is meant to save the world. The races are fairly standard as well (elves, dwarves, humans) but there are two different races that are fairly intriguing called the Delvers and the Algors. I can't say I understand what makes a Delver a Delver except for the ability to access things quicker and move quicker, apparently they appear human except for their height. The Algors are pretty cool and I wish there were more of an explanation to them. Sometimes the explanations of things were repetitive and far too detailed  each time mentioned, but at the same time a lot of the details really brought parts of the story to life. Considering the severity of their quest I didn't expect it to be all in one book, however it was and there were times where the journey seemed rushed (time skips) which threw me off a little. Though it's not entirely original it was enjoyable and I didn't have trouble trying to finish it.",neutral,book

Layered drinks like the rose milk latte aren't just eye-catching on Instagram-- they're also delicious! I've tried their milk tea and their fruity tea, and they do both well. I would definitely bring anyone here, because they serve things like ice cream and can please people who don't like/aren't willing to try boba. It's also a little cheaper than some other boba places around here. Every time I've been here, the staff have been exceptionally nice. That, coupled with how quickly they make drinks, is what really makes them a five star establishment in my eyes. They also have a good variety of flavors, including non dairy and caffeine free choices, and the ability to customize sugar levels. Someday I'll get ice cream here, but their tea is so good that I haven't been able to not order it!",positive,restaurant

It was so delicious, I almost cried it was gone. The rose milk latte was so fresh and sweet which is how I love my boba.

Probably some of the best boba I've had. Thai tea had great flavor. My only complaint was the cashier taking the order. When we were ready to order he just looked at us and didn't say a word.

I am typically not a fan of ice cream, but I have to say this was so good, I will definitely be back again! I highly recommend you stop in here and check it out for yourself. It's a very clean place and there are so many options when it comes to what you want. I want to try their strawberry cheesecake swirl next! Someone in front of us got it & it looked so good.

I wish there was a place to sit and eat besides the two chairs they provide because I'd be here all day. The first visit I got an Oreo cupcake and chocolate mousse. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was delicious (I normally hate frosting). The mousse was so rich and fluffy. The second visit we got another Oreo cupcake and my boyfriend got a caramel lobster tail. The cupcake was just as good as on the first visit. The lobster tail was delicious! (I'm not even a fan of caramel.) The filling was so light and soft. It was not that sweet which we loved since it was stuffed with it and it could have been overwhelming if it was too sweet.

I can imagine though that there are times when this place gets packed. My girlfriend tried the lobster tail and I had the mini white mousse.

I got a small Cannoli, the famous Lobster Tail and a Pecan Danish. The Cannoli was pretty good. Light, crispy and not too sweet. The Pecan Danish was pretty good too. Buttery and rich with a lovely toasty crunch of pecans. The Lobster Tail was the best pasty I've ever had in my entire life. Layers upon layers of crispy, crunchy, flakey pastry encased around a rich and fluffy pastry cream. The pastry cream was freaking amazing and I could've eaten that alone with a spoon! It wasn't too sweet and had hints of amaretto and vanilla. If I could have a Lobster Tail once a week for my whole life I would die of happiness. One thing I liked a lot about this place, that the pastries are not overwhelmingly sweet, at least not the ones I got. I hate it when pastries and baked goods are too sweet. Service was fast but nothing extraordinary. I will be coming back here for my lobster tail every time I am in Vegas.",positive,restaurant

163697,"If this is what all of being vegan tastes like, sign me up (lol it's not, and don't). But these are possibly THE most flavorful doughnuts I've ever had - as in real, fresh, natural ingredient flavor, not just fried sugar bomb flavor (although there's a time and place for that too). We visited the first day they re-opened after the COVID-19 closure - aaaand they were sold out. So we returned the next weekend and waited in line for about 30 minutes before finally getting our chance. It's a clean and simple interior with lots of big pretty plants, a menu board, and a counter with all the fresh goodies lined up and waiting to be eaten! When we walked in, the trays for two of the flavors we wanted most were empty. We're so used to this happening (see: Brewnuts) but UNLIKE Brewnuts they had more ready in the back within 2 minutes. It's almost like they anticipated which flavors would be popular and planned ahead so that customers wouldn't leave disappointed. I appreciate that so much! Staff were very friendly and efficient too. Way to do business! We tried the maple cream, lemon lavender, blueberry cake, strawberry shortcake, banana pudding, and old fashioned cake. There wasn't a bad or even mediocre one in the bunch. These are very light and fluffy doughnuts, not heavy or dense at all. And again, the flavors are so fresh and well done that it really put them over the top. The maple cream was the sweetest of the bunch, and my husband and I both agreed that the strawberry shortcake was our favorite. We can't wait to come back and try more of their amazing flavors.

I was planning the event from another state so I had to do everything via email. They were so easy to work with! They had great flavor suggestions. I also asked if they could put just a few fresh flowers on a few of the cakes to be pretty. When it was finally the day to pick them up, pick up was a breeze. I didn't open the box until we got home and CHILLS!!! I literally got chills for how gorgeous the cakes were! Each one was a perfect little masterpiece. I ordered 5 flavors, 3 for the shower and 2 for the bachelorette part to follow. They were too gorgeous, so all 5 went to the shower! All of the ladies oohed and ahhed over them. But that wasn't even the best part: they tasted AMAZING!! I couldn't be happier with Butterwood!! They really added a special touch to a special day! I just wished I still lived in Pittsburgh so I could visit there all of the time and try all of their amazing treats and interesting flavors! Also, side note, though I just stopped in to pick up the cakes, the shop is also amazing! Great decor and atmosphere! I'd die to be on a date with my man or my mum here! PERFECTION all around!!

163834,"I stopped by with two friends a couple of weeks ago on a Sat. evening. Given that we were looking to get together later in the evening for hot beverages or dessert, Butterwood fit the bill, so we headed over to L-ville to check it out. Because their specialty is clearly cake and there weren't many other desserts in the case, we each ordered a slice of cake ($6 + tax each). Going against my usual adventurous streak when it comes to edibles, I decided to play it safe and stick with the chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream icing. The cake was velvety in texture, but not quite as most as I was hoping, and it was rather stiff on the iced side. As for the icing, it was definitely the best part of the cake--it was decadently creamy and rich, as buttercream should be. My friends ordered the chocolate pistachio cake and the vanilla poppy seed cake, and I tried bites of both. The cake component of the chocolate pistachio seemed identical to my chocolate cake, but the icing was saltier than mine with a rather muted pistachio taste. The vanilla poppy seed was the most interesting of the bunch, consisting of yellow cake and tangy vanilla icing sprinkled generously with poppy seeds. As others have mentioned, the slices were rather large, such that neither of my friends entirely finished theirs (as usual, I unabashedly housed my entire slice, however). If you visit and don't see a cake that you'd enjoy, I'd recommend waiting a bit and checking back, given that the cakes seem to rotate. By the time that we left, all of the cakes that'd been available when we ordered had been replaced by different types of cakes (hello, Meyer lemon cake!). The atmosphere is quaint, making it an ideal setting in which to relax and catch up over dessert and/or hot beverages. If you're a night owl and/or a fan of dessert, I definitely recommend checking it out--your inner Martha Stewart will definitely be pleased!",positive,restaurant

164148,"Handel's is a great ice cream shop where you won't find the quality like this for the price. Pretty fantastic. We've been coming here weekly for years and here is a very seasoned (and now fat) take on this spot: Pros: -Really creamy, high butter-fat ice cream. -4 scoop sampler is best value at about a dollar a scoop. Pretty amazing. -TONS of flavors, albeit unbalanced Cons: -Ice cream quality is hit or miss with flavors. I've had more misses than hits with the mix-ins they add. For example, I've had blue monster 6 times in the past couple months and I'd say 4 out of the 6 barely had any cookies mixed into it. I've had a time where I got buckeye and had ZERO buckeyes in it. Again, I'd sadly say I've had a lack of mix-ins than a good amount. -Flavors. While they have a lot, it is HEAVILY skewed to fruit flavors. I know this is a business, but they only have a couple peanut butter/chocolate options and many more fruit flavors. Favorites of ours like Chocolate Cake Batter and Snix will probably never come back, according to the manager. Very frustrating. This is why we just get Ben & Jerry's at the Smith's next door, and even inspired us to make our own ice cream with the flavors we like. -Be prepared to wait. They take a LONG TIME. I don't think the workers are slow by any means, people just like to order a lot I'm guessing. With our family still deciding at the window, our whole ordering and receiving process takes only a couple of minutes, where I've seen customers take 15 plus minutes. Not sure why this is, but I would love a ""speedy"" check out line for 2 or 3 items or less. I've left line multiple times to just get Ben & Jerry's to come back to Handel's and the line has barely moved. They should address this as I know, from us alone, they've lost business because of this. Overall, great ice cream, we love it. But we have stopped coming significantly due to lack of consistency in quality and their lack of flavors we love. If you are a fruit ice cream fan, you shouldn't have any complaints, other than the long wait times. If you are a mint or peanut butter fan, your options are limited and you will most likely be disappointed.",positive,restaurant
164152,"Definitely some of the best ice cream I've had. The selection is massive and the prices for the amount served are more than generous. I highly recommend even if you have to go out of your way. The lines are long so bring your patience, it will be worth the wait :)",positive,restaurant

164180,"If you love ice cream, you'll love Handel's. They have an array for flavors that are all homemade! They are a take out only restaurant. The line is always so long but so worth the wait. We always get the sampler which's includes 4 scoops for $5! So far, their banana foster is my all time fave but I've also never had anything I didn't like there.",positive,restaurant
164181,"This is by far the best ice cream around. I was first introduced to Handel's in Southern California. I was so happy to see them build one in Vegas. To be honest, the location isn't the greatest but I'm definitely willing to make the drive for this frozen goodness. There are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from. If you are new to Handle's, I highly recommend the 4 scoop sampler. They give you a solid amount of ice cream for $4.25. I have tried 10 or so flavors but once I found my favorite flavor, it has been hard to part from it. My favorite is definitely Chocoholic Chunk. If you like chocolate ice cream or dark chocolate in general, you gotta try it. It is super creamy and will quench your chocolate craving in no time at all. I haven't tried their shakes, malts, or coolers because their homemade ice cream is just too good on its own. On Tuesday night they have $2.50 for one scoop in dish or sugar cone. They give you a nice big scoop too. Just a fair warning, the line is huge on Tuesday nights. But that said, they move pretty fast at the window. I can't recommend Handel's enough.",positive,restaurant
164249,Friendly staff and so many choices!! Love that you can pick 4 flavored as combo and try them all.,positive,restaurant
164284,"The quality is so good. The downside is the wait, and they get busy sometimes, but they're nice here and the flavors and quality of the ice cream are worth it. We're addicted now!",positive,restaurant
164379,"Omg!!! Delicious flavors. Ice cream was delicious, added some extra toppings too. Staff was very nice and patient.",positive,restaurant
164381,Awesome ice cream best in town! Great flavors and so many to choose from. I love to get the sampler it's 4 med sized scoops for a great price and u get to try them this way. Friendly staff and the best ice cream in town! Definitely will come again and again!!!!,positive,restaurant
164462,"Awesome awesome ics cream! We did the 4 flavor sampler. Strawberry cheesecake, cinnamon Graham, cookie dough and asked the guy manning the store for the 4th flavor! He gave us blueberry cobbler and MAN! IT ROCKED!",positive,restaurant
164471,It's in the smiths parking lot ! Back Corner ! You order by the walk up window. Customer service is awesome! All very friendly. I came here on a Tuesday and it was 2 bucks Tuesday ! Such a great deal. Ice cream was delicious. I got the ny cheesecake and my bf got the graham station.,positive,restaurant
164516,"First time here and loving it!!!!! This place is amazing they make fresh ice cream daily.. Why you ask, because they run out all the time! How can u go wrong. The owner is super cool and friendly I think he said Ohio. The proof is in the taste, it's so fresh and creamy. They have tons of flavors to choose from, the best day to go there is on Tuesday. It's two dollar scoop day all day long...... I will be back for more!! A-MAY-ZING",positive,restaurant
164606,"The ice cream here is amazing! Easily the top ice cream I've had in vegas so far. They have tons of flavors... My husband and I both got a four scoop sampler. I tried the salted caramel truffle (my favorite!!), the cookie dough, the banana cream pie which really tastes like its name, and the chocolate marshmallow. My only suggestion would be to make the chocolate marshmallow more marshmallow-y, it's just the chocolate ice cream with marshmallows in it and I was expecting more throughout. My husband got plain chocolate and vanilla, cotton candy, and the watermelon ice. Usually, ice has no taste but this one was so tasty! I can't wait to go back and try more. They also gave my toddler a free baby cone of vanilla. The prices are really great, we spent $9 and change and I gave the girl a $10 and told her to keep it and she was super grateful just for that little tip. I highly recommend this place, it was perfect to sit outside at nice with my family and enjoy a treat.",positive,restaurant
164656,Anything you going to find is is superb. This is the only real French bakery I am aware of in the charlotte area. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that if you come in the evening they don't have much left to choose from.,positive,restaurant
164679,Have loved Amelies for a long long time and I absolutely love their new location for noda! Its bright and clean without a difference in the food quality. No complaints!!,positive,restaurant
164706,God save my gainzzzz! This place is phenomenal for sweet tooth folks! Their bakery is all hand made and presented in an exquisite way while being so fresh and so delicious that you will only come back for more! Fantastic spot to hang out or go on a date or just have a quick bite mid day! Their variety of options is amazing and it is always clean and tidy and most friendly.,positive,restaurant
164709,"I've been coming here for years, and I will never not love it. Today I got a chocolate mousse cup and a salted caramel brownie torte-- both are fantastic! A must-go every time I'm in Charlotte.",positive,restaurant
164724,"Beautiful place to have breakfast or afternoon tea. Stand line first, order and get the number, they deliver to your table. Cappuccino was the best! Sandwich also. I don't think we can't find this level of bakery easily in any other city. A must visit place when you are in Charlotte.",positive,restaurant
164747,"What a Gem we have in Amelie's! Sweet or Savory, its all here! I believe this is the closest I will come to sitting in a French Bistro in France, and I am 100% fine with that! The dÃ©cor, staff and all the goodies are consistently top notch! Definitely don't miss this place!",positive,restaurant
164995,"This was our second time visiting. It was absolutely delicious! The choices are a wide variety of french cuisine! We enjoyed the sandwiches, the croissants, and the macarons. It was a beautiful day to sit outside and enjoy the food and surroundings!",positive,restaurant
165036,"I've been to Amelie's countless times yet I've never written a review. Must be because I was too busy stuffing my face with French delicacies. This next statement is no exaggeration...EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD. You can't go wrong when the food is as fresh as it is here. All of the pastries and breads are made in house. For everything that they can't make in house they use only the freshest ingredients! One of my favorite things...IT'S ALWAYS OPEN...no literally, they never close so you can wake up in the middle of the night and get a pastry or pull an all nighter studying inside or stumble in for some fancy hangover food. Whatever you want!! My personal faves: Sandwiches: turkey and brie (wiring fresh seasonal compote, chicken salad and Spinach Asiago open faced sandwich Soups: All of them!! They rotate!!! Pastry: I'm not a fan of overly sweet so I prefer the cheese and strawberry and cream cheese croissants Drink: the best, creamiest chai in the world You're welcome...",positive,restaurant
165084,I love coming here and the fact that it's open 24 hours makes it the best late night snack stop! My husband and I come here at the end of most of our date nights. They have a great variety of French pastries. Great dessert spot and super awesome decor.,positive,restaurant
165110,"4.5 stars... Had to bump this rating up. The caramel brownie is DIVINE! I'm sitting here nibbling on it since its too good to eat all at once and wallow in misery after finishing it. Try at least once, seriously.",positive,restaurant
165129,"This place is one of the things I miss about Charlotte. Open 24 hours and always enjoy what I order, whether savory or sweet. (Usually come for dessert though!) The salted caramel square, macarons and croissants are my favorites. I also like that they have non-dairy options for coffee instead of just milk or cream. Great place to get a delicious dessert on holidays when other places are closed.",positive,restaurant
165191,"Definitely a dope spot. Just moved to Charlotte from Florida and I love little coffee shops. Well, this wasn't little and it's a bakery, but it's dope AF. It's in the shape of a snail shell. Lots of spots to sit and have a personal chat. But the best part ... it's open all night!! What a sweet nightmare! I had a latte that had mixed herbs ... LORDT!!! I didn't care that my mouth was burned for almost two weeks after ... and the pastry was amazing. Can't remember what it was called since I was in awe of how pretty it looked... and it tasted just as pretty. I also got lucky because I heard the lines are always very long, but nope. I was the 5th customer in line. Great experience!! I'm definitely coming back here again. By the way, the wall of locks is such a good touch to the spot!",positive,restaurant
165237,"Ever since my wife and I got back from Paris last year she can't get enough of this place. The macaroons are identical in taste and quality to what we had there. A definite must try if you've never had them before. The chocolate eclairs are also very good and aren't overly sweet and heavy like some can be. As many have commented already the Carmel brownie is excellent! The brownie consistency is a bit more dense than what in was expecting but it really worked well with the Carmel. Their drinks are pretty stellar as well. Try the lemonade, you won't be disappointed. It's also good to know that they are open 24 hours. This may come in handy if you have a wife that's pregnant or you are fat like me and wake up dreaming of delicious deserts! Mmmmmm brownies...",positive,restaurant
165242,"Fun funky decor, very tasty pastry's and a lot of room. We were in Charlotte for the summer and this place became my wife's Spirit Animal. Definitely check it out.",positive,restaurant
165254,"I can't say enough great things about this place! My aunt recommended this place since she said the ambiance was very cute and the food was great! She was SO RIGHT! As soon as you walk in, you're transported into a different world that is so unique and warm. They have so many different dessert and drink options. And the food was so fresh and delicious. I tried the turkey and brie and it was absolutely delicious. For dessert, I indulged in an apple pie which was the perfect ending to a great meal! There are plenty of places to sit and I noticed there were several group meetings going on. The place is also open 24 hours! Just perfect! I look forward to visiting again soon!",positive,restaurant
165342,"24-hour places are far and few between, especially in the Bible Belt they call ""The Dirty South"". You get Waffle House, McDonalds, a handful of gas stations and Amelie's French Bakery--not to be confused with the lowbrow 24-hour options of the past. Amelie's is heaven on earth. Despite the loooong (looooooooong) line to pick out your pastries, the whole bakery is a wonderful place to be. There are plenty of seats, bistro seating with tiny tables and tiny chairs as well as overstuffed furniture to settle into with your laptop (for the free wi-fi). Everyone will suggest to you that you get the salted caramel brownie. And you should, if you like your caramel poured on thick with a thin layer of brownie. But rest assured: whatever you choose, you will love it all.",positive,restaurant
165380,"What can I say that hasn't already been written about Amelie's? If you appreciate the occasional sweet treat, this place has the best in Charlotte. I am a fan of macaroons and theirs are simply delish. The macaroons I have tried here include pistachio, lemon, salted caramel, passion-fruit, and coconut. I particularly enjoyed the coconut and the lemon. Another favorite treat here is the salted caramel brownie - it has the perfect balance of sweet and just a hint of salt in the creamy caramel. There are so many goodies behind the counter that I have not tried yet, and I am always looking forward to my next visit. The hard part is choosing between the Ã©clairs, napoleons, tarts, and all of the other yummy-looking pastries! Thank goodness they aren't close to my work or home, or I'd be having to put in a lot of extra gym time to work off all those extra calories!",positive,restaurant
165410,"Okay so, everyone loves to come here and work. It is either quiet enough or has a low noise volume to the point where it is so pleasant to come in and work on your laptop. It is hard to find a space to work, but once you find it, you can at least get cozy with your coffee and food. There is something here for everyone. I love the mochas and the macaroons. My go to is the mixed berry tart or the pecan tart.",positive,restaurant
165470,"I just realized that I have not reviewed Amelie's - one of my favorite-est bakeries around. Let me just tell you about my love affair with this French bakery. 1) They have salted caramel brownies. Yup, you read it correctly. Absolutely delectable salty/sweet/chocolately goodness. It will certainly give you a toothache and you'll appreciate it. 2) This place is open 24 hours. Holla! 3) The croissants. Oh momma likes. My personal fave is the strawberry cream cheese, but the chocolate will do in a pinch, too. 4) Great coffee. The kind of coffee that you enjoy outside the states,. No Folgers, here, friends. 5) Free WiFi! Woot! 6) The all around lovely atmosphere. Amelie's is just a cozy, breath of fresh air for me. The perfect spot to park with a laptop or stuff my face with umpteen pastries. On a side note, I haven't tried Amelie's lunchy food yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Amelie's makes me (almost) love the French - it's THAT good.",positive,restaurant
165560,"I absolutely love AmÃ©lie's. & although the never have anymore cream cheese pastries when I visit, they still deserve all 5 stars. The NoDa location is the only one I frequent and the atmosphere in there is always completely different. I love it. If you're in school its a great study spot with plenty of nooks and corners to have some coffee and get work done. Great spot for meetings or even just to come alone and sit and read. The coffee and pastries are A1, but I've never tried anything off of the hot menu. Though I'm sure its delicious. Best part, they're open 24/7 (still can't figure out the best time for those cream cheese pasteries), and although the line is always super long - the staff is great, and always willing to explain the difference between each and every macaroon. Ha.",positive,restaurant
165588,"The food is unbelievable whether its a sandwich, a box full of desserts, or a cheese tray. My personal favorite are the mini crÃ¨me brulee's, they have seasonal flavors. I love visiting Amelie's in the middle of the night to people watch, there is such a huge range of people who visit you never know who you might see.",positive,restaurant
165602,"I love everything about this place, the locations in Noda & Rock Hill are my favorite.",positive,restaurant
165638,Wife loves this place. Our French foreign exchange student said the croissants were not like in France and needed more butter. The croque monsieur was not like in France because there was mustard and it is served on a croissant. The baguette was close to French standards but the Brie was not good. This was on my sandwich. Will come back.,positive,restaurant
165717,"After a long day, and a healthy fish and veggie dinner, I deserved a treat. We drove over to Amelie's, and words cannot express the fact that I will be back. What a quaint, unique, funky atmosphere. However, that was nothing! The coffee and desserts were amazing!! My favorite, the Carmel chocolate brownie, that salty sweet treat everyone craves! The macaroons were delist! I will be back to enjoy this unique place and their amazing treats!!!",positive,restaurant
165728,"I've been going for that past 4 years, I go so much they follow me on Instagram lol. Always a delight to stop by for some pie !",positive,restaurant
165793,"What's not to love about this place? I enjoyed some great coffee and some pretty good macarons really late on a weeknight. They are pretty mediocre as far as macarons are concerned, but they hit the spot. There was a bit of a wait, but it was worth it. Even at the off time, it was hard to find a seat. They definitely need more seating. This is a great place for people watching.",positive,restaurant
165807,"So... what can you say about the best place on Earth that a bunch of others haven't said? I'm not that good at making up niceties, so... Love this place! How's that?",positive,restaurant
165832,This is for the NoDa Amelies......I really like everything about the place...the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable...I have an incredible sweet tooth and this place never fails to satisfy....My personal favorites are the Eclairs and anything with salted caramel. Definitely worth the trip.,positive,restaurant
165835,There's really nothing you can say bad about Amelie's. I even brought my dad's gf who is a French citizen and she loved the place. Raved about their pastries and croque monsieur. We'll always come here.,positive,restaurant
165862,One of my favorite spots to go to in Charlotte. They are nestled in a historic building with lots of eclectic arts and extremely laid-back cozy vibe. The pastries are divine and they have something for everyone's dietary needs. The coffee is very good. The customer service is amazing considering the line is always wrapping through the building. At some point maybe I'll actually go in and have a meal instead of just dessert.,positive,restaurant
165896,"Well, it obviously a very famous place for their great pastries, sandwiches, soups, beverages. This place is very special for me and my wife and have had great memories here. It being 24x7 operational, adds more value to itself. My fav are the most familiar Salted Caramel Brownie, chocolate gateaux, chicken salad sandwich, almond cake (to die for), and Chai tea latte. This is the first place where we tried Chai tea latte with soy milk and that taste has become a standard. The ambience for sure gives you a French feel or at least you will learn the French taste. Friday and Saturday late nights are always pretty crowded as lot of people come here for their favorite bites after party. With wifi it's a great place to work/study as well. A must go in Charlotte if you like pastries :)",positive,restaurant
165935,"Yum yum n yum!!! My only suggestion is that the use more filling in the macaroons, they were a bit disappointing when it came to flavor!",positive,restaurant
166001,"Um, WOW. Charming French bakery heaven in the South! Whoa! Uh, lets see, what don't they have?!!! - Chocolates, pastries, sweets galore. Check! - Coffees, teas, and other pallet satisfying drinks. Check! - Awesome Impressionist pastel colors decor. Check! - Board games. Check! - Parking lot. Check! - Open 24 hours. Check! - Takes credit cards. Check! - Uber comfy chairs. Check! If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be at this place ALL THE TIME.",positive,restaurant
166004,"I want to love Amelie's. I'm a baker and lover of all things artsy and weird. But to me, that fifth star just isn't there. Let me explain my conundrum... The concept of a French bakery in Charlotte makes me swoon. Heck, the concept of any kind of bakery not inside a grocery store is a great. I have a long-standing affair with Parisian pastries and flaky breads. Caramel salted brownies? You guys go ahead...I'm going to hang around. The atmosphere is kitschy in a way that works. Incredibly odd light fixtures. Doorways in random places, a framed mirror that wraps around the corner, and a menagerie of random chairs and tables, like a home show for the Island of Misfit Toys. And, open 24 hours. In Charlotte. No further details needed. But, it is crowded. Very, crowded. With so few other options for the people still awake at 3am, the lines are always long. It's rare to find a table in the cafe-proper (better luck in the atrium common area behind their spot). And, (this is me being picky), there usually seem to be a few too many high schoolers who are just so cool and trendy it hurts (no, it really does hurt...my eyes can't take that much skinny jeans and awful plaid...but I digress). In my opinion, they are a bit pricey, too. Yes, they make great food. But $1.50 or $2 for something that is barely one bite? Amelie, I think we will have to continue our love-hate courtship. Let's just not assign a label and see where it goes.",positive,restaurant
166033,"I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for something sweet! They have a variety of goodies on display. I chose a chocolate cake, which was surprisingly light - not heavy or rich. It was covered with chocolate ganache. So good! I also got a cinnamon flavored macaroon with a chocolate ganache, it was a little crispy on the outside and chewy and moist on the inside. I also got a raspberry mousse, dark chocolate mini pot. A small sized yummy treat. To drink, a friend recommended the lavender lemonade. It was delicious, really light and sweet with the lavender flavor. A must try place!",positive,restaurant
166041,"I was so excited to finally go to the famed Amelie's (in NoDa) today with a few friends. When we first pulled up, I noticed that the parking lot was absolutely PACKED, which usually says good things. The decor of Amelie's is quite eclectic, just as the customers are. It marks itself as a French bakery and the art decorating the walls follows that theme. Honestly, it's a gorgeous place. It has a surprisingly large interior with different rooms that are all equipped with extensive seating and tables, as well as two free wi-fi networks. A lot of people were hanging around doing work on MacBooks and eating baked goods. All in all, it appears to be a really funky, awesome place to hang out if you can find a seat. For the food, I tried the vanilla Creme Brulee ($4.99) and purchased the ""award-winning"" Salted Caramel Brownie ($1.79) for later. First of all, I was amazed at the speed of the guy working the counter/register when there was literally 15 people in line being quite loud. Secondly, the Creme Brulee wasn't as great as I hoped it would be. Something about the taste of it wasn't what I was used to. Regardless, it was still pretty decent. I've yet to try to the brownie, but according to the people beside me in line, it is one of the best things available at Amelie's and well worth the two bucks. My friends both tried different large chocolate creations that tasted about the same, but were both quite delicious (this coming from somebody who isn't a chocolate fan). The prices at Amelie's are pretty high, but the environment is worth it. My friends and I all enjoyed what we ordered and agreed it was worth the price. Thanks Amelie's for a great experience!",positive,restaurant
166107,"Oh jesus, what a great place. Excellent pastries and the sandwiches are awesome. Just the plain croissant is a whole new experience",positive,restaurant
166113,"Ok, I stumbled upon this place at 4 am on a thursday night and the aroma of something warm and fresh filled with yumminess was about to come out of the over. The salted carmel brownie are HOLY F&$K MY MOUTH Delicious but if you can fancy yourself a croissant, then you my friend are in heaven!! The place is filled with charming, yet delightful and comfortable places to sit and the bakery is oddly large for that. The aroma is seemingly constant and I could not find myself in a happier place at 4 am and filled with alcoholic beverages. I think I even managed to order $45 worth of pastries just to bring into my ESPN crew the next day to indulge.",positive,restaurant
166126,What can I say? Amelie's is amazing. Their deserts and coffees are mouth watering. They are open 24 hours so you can get an Amelie's fix any time you want! The chocolate ganache is amazing and their tarts are the best in the city! Check them out and you will be hooked. The place has a very fun and quirky atmosphere that gives you that French cafe feeling. Beautiful fun place!,positive,restaurant
166129,"Love, love, love the pastries and atmosphere. The salted caramel brownies are orgasmic. I also recommend any of the layered tortes. My only complaint is that the counter is crammed up front which creates long lines. Otherwise, I think this is the best bakery I've ever been to... and I've been all over the world. It's sinfully good!",positive,restaurant
166130,I just moved here from North Jersey and this is the most delicious bakery I've tried yet. They have these fabulous bars with a brownie bottom and a salty caramel like topping..I couldnt put it down! I got a whole bunch chocolate treats to try out with my roommate and we are instant fans. The atmosphere is really relaxed and the workers so incredibly nice and helpful...not to mention it is 24 hours and all baking is done right on the premises :) Love it!,positive,restaurant
166303,Fun place. Open 24 hours. Good pastries and coffee. Quirky decorations.,positive,restaurant
166304,"Sweet, sweet Amelie's. This is a great place to go when you don't know what you want for dessert. The hours are awesome (11PM pastry run, anyone?) and the pastry case is beautiful. We really love their cream puffs and salted caramel brownies. So far, we haven't eaten anything that's sicky-sweet. Their little bite-sized tarts are delicious and they offer a variety. The macarons are pretty (around eight options) but I really haven't found a macaron I adore (here or anywhere). We've never done it, but this looks like a cozy spot to sit and read with a coffee and dessert...check out the back room - you'll be impressed with how big and colorful it is.",positive,restaurant

166411,"Love Amelies!! The Noda location is great!! The other locations are not a good. I always get the salted caramel brownie and lavender lemonade. Whenever I have guests in town, I always take them there. It is a perfect place to sip coffee and spend time with friends. Seriously love Amelies",positive,restaurant
166445,"Love Love Love this cute french pastry shop. We went for lunch and had delicious simple baguette/croissant sandwiches that were fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the turkey brie croissant. The thai soup with chunks of squash was delicious with just the right amount of seasoning. The salted caramel brownie was delicious, a complete sugar high! Overall, one of the better bakeries I have been to!",positive,restaurant
166562,My daughter takes me here every Mother's Day. Sort of like a tradition with us. It can be very busy on the weekends but it's worth the wait. The prices are reasonable n the salted caramel brownie is AWESOME!!! The decor is funky n cute I love the chandeliers made out of utensils n things I almost bought at shirt with the place on it to advertise for them lol. You won't be disappointed.,positive,restaurant
166679,"It took me a while to get over to Amelie's, which was recommended by a friend, but since my first visit a couple of weeks ago, I've taken five different people in to show them the awesome, and it's a difficult thing to keep myself from going back there every day. The fresh fruit and cheese danishes are possibly the best danish I've ever had in my life, whatever time of day I happen to eat one...in the morning, in the evening, whatever. I've tried a couple of the sandwiches -- the seeded roast beef is particularly good, but the pate with cornichons is also none too shabby. I bought some gluten-free baked treats for a friend of mine who suffers from that tragic non-bread-eating disability, and she loved them, which makes me really appreciate that Amelie's cares enough to provide some options for everyone. And the decor is awesome, and it's not too far a stretch to imagine just hanging out there all the time, although I wouldn't want to contribute to the scarcity of tables. Everything's a little spendy compared to some of the other bakeries around, but it is actually that much better, so there you go.",positive,restaurant
166690,Bouchon you stole my heart. Your Danishes were Delicious. Your Ham and Cheese Croissant was Perfection. You are out of the way at the Venetian but I was willing to walk 22 minutes to get to you.,positive,restaurant

166707,"I guess at this time or season that they don't serve breakfast/brunch meals. Unknown whether they will bring these options back just like before. Lines can be long, but the staff is fast in service. They are also very friendly and welcoming if you have any questions. Location: the one I visited is the bakery located close to the entrance of the Venetian theater and the Venetian Tower Suites guest entrance. There are no tables available. Price: It's decent for pastries. Range is from $2-5, depends what you get. Price for coffee is comparable to Starbucks and Coffee Bean Tea Leaf. Pastries and desserts: They are delicious. Some are very sweet. The cheese danish was very rich in flavor. The Macarons have the perfect texture but not overly sweet. The chocolate bouchon is definitely very sweet but it's worth a try for the first timer.",positive,restaurant
166781,"An outpost of the Yountville original, Bouchon Bakery actually has at least three outlets here on the Venetian/Palazzo campus, as far as I can remember. As such, there are multiple Bouchon Bakery entries here on Yelp and I hope I'm writing a review for the specific outlet I actually checked into. (Additionally, there is also a Bouchon *restaurant* here which is different from the Bouchon *bakery.* I see folks have erroneously posted photos here that are actually of the restaurant.) This particular outlet is a small stand in a busy area right outside the elevators to the Venetian guest rooms and, if I remember correctly, underneath a bank of escalators. It has a compact but decent selection of cookies, macarons, pastries, baked goods, desserts, and sandwiches, plus it also serves espresso and coffee drinks. Things can sell out pretty quickly early in the day, but pretty much anything is good here, whether the macarons, nutter butter cookies, or espresso drinks that I tried. Service is simple and straightforward; there's one person at a counter manning everything. Because this is located right outside the Venetian guest elevators, it's a perfect venue to grab a snack or a small breakfast to go.",positive,restaurant
166812,"Good place for early morning pastries. Even though it's a Thomas Keller venture, the pastries were good but not French Laundry level. Their Almond Croissant was flavorful and flaky without being too buttery. Price is reasonable. Their coffee was nothing spectacular and something that will get you through the morning. Their macaroon was slightly bigger (about double the size) and their vanilla macaroon was good and light but the filling could've use a hint more vanilla extract.",positive,restaurant
166840,"Simple and quick stop to Bouchon bakery is a great way to start your day in Vegas. Tips: - Quality coffee. Dark roasted and rich! - Pastries are reasonably good. If I were not in the area, I wouldn't travel for it. - Single purchase macarons are larger than usual but we didn't try them. The boxed ones look like normal sized. - They do not accept casino credits. If you are staying at The Palazzo or The Venetian, check it out!",positive,restaurant
166862,"Ok this is just a regular bakery at the Venetian right? Ummm this is one of the best bakeries I have ever been to in my life! The taste of all of their pastries is just mouth watering! - croissant: it is the flakiest buttery croissant I ever had! It's huge but will be gone in 3 seconds. There is a few different kinds of croissants and can't go wrong with any of them. But the best to me is the original one - macaroons: all huge! Usually macaroons are a bit chewy or dry. Their center filling is super creamy and light! Which was a shock for me. Can't go wrong with any of the flavors but my favorite is pistachio and earl grey! - muffins: honestly their muffin is great. It's super moist and chewy. Maybe I'm not a muffin fan. Wasn't that impressed - cookies: there is a few variations of cookies. All great but I still think I had better. All in all, great stop if your at the Venetian. They have sandwiches and coffee which I have yet to try. But if I wanted that then I would go to grand Lux next door and I feel like it would be a lot better. No you come here for bakeries. All are amazing and can't go wrong at all in any choice you make. The only down side is that the service is a bit slow, they aren't as organized, and under staffed where it is only one or two people working. Also, the price! It is Vegas after all but usually each baked goods will be about 5 bucks each. But the size does make up for it, still kind of pricey since I usually leave with a good box full. -",positive,restaurant
166870,"This is the outside location, not the internal one. Once my friend got me hooked on the macarons, I had to have some more. The shop wasn't very busy and the folks on the inside were more than happy to help. I bought one box of six small macarons, one of each flavour and I bought 8 of the larger ones. When They brought out a tray of the pistachio, after they'd filled my box and I'd already paid for it, I have to admit I was disappointed. Seeing that, the gentleman helping me gave me one gratis. :) That's what I call customer Service. WAY TO GO! You'll have my business from now on!",positive,restaurant
166880,"The restaurant and the bakery are a must stop for me when I'm in town. There was a conference at the Venetian and the bakery that's inside had a line through the casino. I remembered this location and quickly ducked out of the conference to stop by to grab a coffee and breakfast pastry. I was so glad because this location was basically empty when I stopped in. Food: You cannot go wrong with anything you order from their bakeries. I've tried a number of things from them and my favorites are the oh-oh, chocolate croissant, mini brownie and toffee candy. I usually order an iced vanilla latte for my coffee choice too; it's better than the coffee chains nearby. Staff: Everyone is usually friendly and efficient with your order. I never have to wait too long even if the line is long. Location: this one is tucked away outside of the Venetian. It's upstairs from the Walgreens. Because it's kind of tucked away the line never gets that long.",positive,restaurant
166885,"Bouchon Bakery is located right at the corner of the Venetian, next to Walgreens. It is a little piece of heaven! Macaroons are about $3, but so worth it and they are also bigger than most. I decided on the salted caramel and pistachio ones and they just melt in your mouth. I got there right after they opened so it was fresh and new for me to try. It was light, chewy and not overly sweet. I also ordered the bacon and caramelized onion croissant and it was delicious!! The caramelized onions were my favorite, I could have ate just a cup of that but the croissant made it taste even better. They had alot of other delicious options that I had to say no to since I knew I was running the half marathon later that day. But they had cupcakes, cookies, cakes, croissants and other breakfast items along with drinks. Everything looked delicious and I will be sure to come back here when I come back to Vegas. It's definitely not cheap, but worth it! They are quite addicting too...dangerously delicious!",positive,restaurant
166949,"TIP: They have an upstairs and downstairs location! Had to say that first because I waited in line downstairs for like 15 minutes. I was heading to Treasure Island so I took the elevator next to Bouchon and found they had another bakery counter upstairs with no line. Anyways, I love love love their macarons. So far it's a tie between the pistachio and salted caramel. They are a little pricey ($5 each) but they're about 2.5x the size of a normal macaron and they're just amazing. My second favorite thing to get here is a vanilla chai latte, goes perfect with a macaron :D. Coffee prices are comparable to starbucks. Sad to say I actually haven't tried anything else here. I really have only been able to come here while taking a long walk on the strip. Again, sad to say I don't ever stay the Venetian hotel where it would be much more convenient.",positive,restaurant
167015,It was my first time trying this bakery! I heard good things from my brother and sister-in-law. There is a special on the macarons if you buy 5 then one is free. Each cost $3.25. They are so delicious. The salted caramel flavor has real caramel. They are a good size too so you can share with others if you want to get a variety to try. I also got a Kouign Amann which was really good! The only downfall is that we asked for one vanilla macaron and instead the worker gave us a raspberry. I guess I'll just have to go back and try it! ;D,positive,restaurant
167046,We love the Bouchon! We don't go anywhere else for breakfast when in Vegas. Yum!!!! Every single thing is on point. See my photos.,positive,restaurant
167069,You need to try either the chocolate crescent or the traditional crescent. It's AMAZINGLY hot and flaky. We have only been for breakfast/bunch and are always happy with our meals,positive,restaurant
167127,"Highly recommended! Best macaron. Vanilla is personal favorite, it is not overwhelming sweet. We came to this place by accident. Now this place has become a must-go for each Vegas trip.",positive,restaurant
167187,Stopped in twice during recent visit. Line moved fairly quick. Staff was friendly both times through. First visit ordered peanut butter cookie butter nutter and peanut butter macaroon. Second visit I attempted to order three of the macaroons and another butter nutter cookie. There was some confusion between the person assembling and ringing. After a few shots I ended up with a peanut butter cookie and two macaroons. The butter nutters were so creamy and butter and dreamy. Best peanut butter cookie I have ever had. The macaroons are best fresh but hold well for a day or two. Soft flaky crust filled with rich sweet creamy ingredients. Best cookies and macaroons. So rich fresh flavors. Service was good.,positive,restaurant

167198,Macarons to die for here! I had to return more than once for them:) The beignets were equally as good but they didn't have any wow to them for me. I think the prices are quite reasonable here for what they serve.,positive,restaurant

167280,"They do not make this location easy for you to find! It's tucked around and underneath a set of escalators. I asked 3 different workers of the Venetian and it was the security guard that finally pointed me to the right direction. The first person I asked was from Guest Services too! We were disappointed to find that they did not have the lemon macaron here. My fiancee absolutely loves Bouchon's lemon macaron from Napa. We ended up settling for chocolate and salted caramel. Both were delicious, as expected.",positive,restaurant
167285,"BOUCHON BAKERY BOUCHON BAKERY BOUCHON BAKERY!!!! Is where I have to go before leaving vegas. MACAROONS.... AMAZING! They're HUGE and so fresh and delicious. The cookie has a nice shell on the outside and is soft on the inside. All the macaroons have a buttercream filling which is delicious!!! I like more than the clear gel fillings I've tried. BEWARE, there are two pastries stands on the casino floor of the Venetian. BOUCHON BAKERY is hidden BEHIND the elevator. Also important to note, they dont have a specific closing time... so go early in the evening just in case. Try it Try itt!!!",positive,restaurant
167306,"Kind of an obscure location, it's hiding under the escalator! My friends and I had to go and ask three workers to tell us where it was. After being mislead a few times and wandering around aimlessly on the casino floor, we finally found it. I guess it didn't help that I was smashed from my Fat Tuesday's drink, but that's another story... The traditional croissant met all my expectations for everything I love about these buttery little bastards: flaky crust on the outside, soft and airy on the inside. Well done. One bite of my friend's strawberry croissant and I was hooked. Incredibly moist, sweet without feeling like you'll develop a cavity. I also had a taste of the chocolate macaron, which was very rich and decadent. It felt so sinful! So-so with the s'more cheesecake. The textures were off, in my opinion. The chocolate was chunky and hard, would've been much better smooth like the cream filling. The marshmallow was difficult to eat. And the butter in the graham cracker crust overpowered the other flavors. The next day I returned and got some bread that resembled foccacia. It was so soft like a pillow. The only awkward thing that happened was that I forgot my green tea at the barista counter. Realizing this 10 minutes later, I returned and it was still there. I wanted to make sure that it was mine, so I asked the workers. They just gave me blank stares.",positive,restaurant
167327,"We got their croissant, focaccia bread with feta cheese and tomatoes, and vanilla bean macaron and pistachio maracons. Their croissant was OK, not great, it didn't taste really fresh and the inside wasn't as buttery as I prefer. Their focaccia bread was good, they warmed it for us and there was a nice pesto soaked into the bread. Their vanilla bean macaron was delicious!!! Much better than the pistachio one.",positive,restaurant
167331,Their chocolate cupcake was AMAZING. So rich and decadent. Their macarons were pretty good for the price of $3.50 each. And I have to say the fillings for the macarons definitely had a lot of flavor to it! It's certainly is a hidden gem!,positive,restaurant
167352,"On our last morning in Vegas, my friend, my boyfriend and I just wanted to relax and have a good warm breakfast...nothing wild so that we could calmly take in the beauty of the place. We walked to the Venetian and right on the corner toward T.I., there was this adorable little bakery (which I now know is part of the Bouchon Cuisine) that smelled of fresh roast coffee. We ordered the Turkey Sandwich and this really amazing wrap with Chicken, apples, nuts (i think) and coffee. We sat outside and had a nice view of the strip and the front of the Venetian. This place was great, and I highly recommend coming here to try...even just a small pastry!",positive,restaurant
167355,This place is amazing. The chocolate almond croissant and TLC cookies are my favorite. The shortbread cookies are heavenly. Every time I visit Vegas I go out of my way to visit this sugar jewel.,positive,restaurant
167358,"Bouchon Bakery, right off the bat, is a tough place to find! It's not located directly in the Grand Canal Shops of Venetian. Rather, it is located off the grid of the Grand Canal Shops at the end of a long line of other shops and high-end restaurants. It's a very small bakery. When I was there, there were only a few people there, so the line went fast. I got four macarons -- red velvet, chocolate, salted caramel, and pistachio. The red velvet and chocolate were my favorites. The salted caramel and pistachio were okay, but they were too chewy and might have been chilled for a long time. Other than that, the bakery itself was very quaint and cute. It offers other pastries as well, like cakes, croissants, danishes, and cupcakes. I would definitely come back here to try different goods!",positive,restaurant
167366,"Once I saw ""By Thomas Keller"" I knew that I had to try this bakery! The Bouchon Bakery is somewhat hidden from public view. It's located next to The Phantom of the Opera Theater, next to The Grand Lux Cafe, inside The Venetian. The day I decided to try the Bouchon Bakery it was the morning I was in search of a good latte and pastry/cookie. When I went down the elevators from my hotel room, I spotted this little spot packed and busy. I came closer and saw what all the buzz was about. Delicious looking pastries, breads, desserts, and more delicacies! I figured it was a go! I really did not want to spend more than $6 like I did the night before on a small cappuccino at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf that was mediocre. WOW! Everything looked so amazingly fresh! I really wanted to try their foccacia that had feta, onion, and oven dried tomatoes and their chocolate croissant or their sensational looking fruit tarts or Bavarian Creams that had the golden chocolate transfer patterns...but I had to resist! I was going to have lunch with friends and so I decided to buy a vanilla soy latte and a cranberry biscotti. That combo was a winner! The latte was not too sweet and it went very well with the sweetness of the biscotti. The next morning, before I left Vegas, I figured that I had to buy some macaroons! I purchased the chocolate and raspberry macaroons and they were very good. Their macaroons had the texture of a cross between a cake and a cookie but it fit it will! They were soft, chewy and the flavor swirled in my palate and it was not too sweet! The filling inside of them was just right and they did not look sloppy. Excellent! $3.50 each....little pricey but it's Vegas! You can also purchase their coffee beans! Customer services is very friendly!",positive,restaurant
167420,"We were getting ready to leave for the airport and wanted to get a bite to eat in the hotel before we left. It was close, on the way out to the airport and we assumed it would probably kick the crap out of any airport food you could get. Here's what we sampled: Turkey Brie Sandwich: Brie, lettuce, roast turkey, and mustard. Warmed and pressed, the bread had a texture of a ciabatta which was good, the creaminess of the brie got a little sticky and runny in the sandwich after heating it, and I liked the aroma and texture of melted brie in any way shape or form. Still, I have to admit, this didn't outstanding, it was good, but the taste wasn't any different from a sandwich that I could have made myself. Vegetable jardiniere Sandwich: With Portabello mushroom, eggplant, fennel, caramelized onions, picquillo pepper, fontina cheese and pesto. My g/f ordered this. Oh my goodness. This is the sandwich I SHOULD have ordered from the start. It is a vegetarian sandwich, but the meatiness of the mushrooms, the texture of the eggplant, with the aromatics and crisp bite from the fennel. Each bite was almost a unique cathartic experience, you had a mixture of caramelized onions, the mellow heat and body from the pepper and the melted fontina cheese was able the sit carefully on the knife edge on being flavorful and robust but also remained delicate enough it didn't overpower the sandwich. Seriously, my g/f loved this sandwich so much, it was almost impossible for me to get additional bites, I even offered her a trade on our sandwiches, where she simply smiled at me and continued eating. This was a fantastic sandwich that even me; a devote carnivore, feel as though this was a sandwich that I would be happy to eat on a regular basis. Chocolate bouchons: Their name was given due to the fact that they are shaped like the corks from bottle of wine. Without a doubt they certainly taste better then the real corks, these little morsels were rich and super moist, with little chocolate bits inside. It reminds me of a brownie, a damn good one at that. Chocolate Eclair: This was my dessert, me being the chocoholic after first glance when I saw it in the glass enclosure, I didn't stand a chance. The choux pastry dough, was light and airy, carried a light and subtle sweetness, additionally the chocolate creme patissiere was decadent and smooth, and there was a rich slathering of more chocolate right on top, creating a lovely balance with each intoxicating mouthful. Lemon Tart: My g/f's choice, and quite honestly she has bested me once again, in terms of picking the item I would get again, the lemon filling almost reminded me of a lemon curd; with all the zest that they put in you could really taste the fresh lemons, the wonderful level of acidity balanced with a creamy richness. Most notably, is the crust, here rather then to just do a pie crust or a simple graham cracker crust, they went with a fresh pine nut crust, the pine nuts created a great aroma, nutty texture with a crisp crunch. With each bite of the two elements, with their contrasting flavors, and textures melded together creating a absolutely amazing dish. It's a must try for those that have yet to experience this, and one I'll be getting next time. Parisian Macaroons Appearance wise these were stunning, I bought a couple of boxes to take back home as gifts, and even though up front they ran out, the staff were kind enough to go into the back room and make the rest to complete our order. Wonderful presentation and colors, I was told that they each had different flavors, (which included lemon, orange, strawberry, vanilla, mocha and chocolate.) Basically, we had a delay and ultimately a cancelled flight so me and my g/f may have dug into one of the boxes, you know we had to sample the gift we were giving and we did want to make sure the gift we were about to give was fresh since our next flight would be the next day. So we sampled a box. Rich, chewy and super dense, with a wonderful flavor sandwiched with a very thin layer of creme. If I had to rate it in the order of preference, it went vanilla, coffee, lemon, chocolate, strawberry and orange. Goes really well with a nice cup of plain coffee as well! The next day on our way back for attempt #2 to the airport, we stopped by one more time here and replenished the macaroons gift box that we consumed while taste testing it. So make sure next time your here go ahead and give into whatever pastries and sweets you desire just make sure don't leave without trying the lemon tart and the Vegetable jardiniere!",positive,restaurant

But if you do happen to stumble upon it, do yourself a favor and get a boxed set of macarons! I brought some home and even after 4 days, they still held up nicely and were soft and chewy without sticking to your teeth.",positive,restaurant

167543,"Stopped here on the way out after seeing the Blue Man Group, as I wanted to get my husband some pastries for breakfast tomorrow. I bought 2 chocolate croissants and 2 cheese danishes. My husband thought the chocolate croissants at the M resort (Babycakes) were better, but admittedly I liked these better from Bouchon. But as I'm not really a huge sugar eater and spend more time tasting and buying for my husband, his opinion counts more than mine! The cheese danishes were odd, but not in a bad way. It was almost like they were baked like the croissants, and flaky in the same way. I personally liked these better than the croissants. If I'm at the Venetian again, since I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, I'll try the macaroons.",positive,restaurant
167563,"Hello Macaroons. I came here specifically for their desserts because my visit at the one in Yountville was soo good. I wanted to get a sandwich too, but they ran out of them, so I got some Focaccia bread, which was somewhat oily but really tasty. I decided to get two macaroons - chocolate and mint chocolate. Tasty. There's no seating nearby so I wandered near the casino and found seating at a food court. This place was somewhat hidden. I had to ask someone who worked at the hotel to tell me where it is.",positive,restaurant

167667,"Tucked right underneath the escalator at the Venetian, Bouchon Bakery is easy to miss. They have a good variety of breakfast pastries, macarons, and cupcakes. I liked my almond croissant alot. It was filled with almost paste, just the way I like it. My husband had the chocolate croissant although he said he expected it to wow him more. You know, Bouchon Bakery is part of the Thomas Keller empire after all. My husband did like their coffee alot. As everyone else has said, the macarons are huge. I wasn't even that hungry for breakfast but had to get one to eat with my croissant. I ordered the coffee macaron but only later realized that I was given the chocolate macaron :/ The texture of the macaron was very good. Slightly crisp shell and soft in the inside. Bouchon Bakery is a stand and does not have a seating area. So unless you are planning to bring your coffee and pastries back to your hotel room, I recommend taking them to the Grand Canal Shoppes area and sitting on one of the benches to enjoy your pastries and coffee while enjoying the canal views inside the Venetian.",positive,restaurant
167720,"Bouchon, I finally found you. I've been to Vegas how many times and I always seem to miss your macarons. I made it a point to find you this past trip. You offer expensive baked goods but the macaron variety pack is well worth the trip to the Venetian. I paid $17.50 for 6 macarons (lemon, orange, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, and vanilla). My favorite was the lemon one - very refreshing. These macarons are huge - bigger than most macarons I've seen from other places. Unfortunately they didn't travel well. These are delicate cookies that almost didn't survive the heat and the flight. But I got them home and the edges were crumbly and the creamy filling had partially melted. But still, they tasted good. The case with the baked goods looked tempting - I would have gotten one of each if I had the space in my suitcase.",positive,restaurant
167772,"I'm probably one of the few people (if any) who don't like their macarons (I think their macarons are the worst in town). What I came here in search for was kouign amann. I was dying to try this and I was so excited that they had it. So, I bought two. Who wouldn't love a crusty, doughy cake containing layers of butter and sugar folded in? Also had them throw in a couple beignets, raspberry filled. Delicious! Yes this place is overpriced, but it's a strip venue, the name Thomas Keller attached. What do you expect? I didn't complain, it was worth the 10,000 calories.",positive,restaurant
167780,"i'm a fan of the restaurant, so of course i had to try the bakery...which is kind of hard to find...it's behind the escalators. almost everything i tried has been good...especially the mini brownies and the financiers. i thought the french macarons were just okay...they tasted good, but the flavors were hard to discern unless you already knew what they were...and they were too big...as i've mentioned before in another review, think macaroons taste best when they are bite size =) they have a pretty good selection of other bakery/pastry items...and also sandwiches that are perfect for togo.",positive,restaurant

Bouchon Bakery got really great reviews and hubby loves all sorts of pastries so we decided to stop by. Thanks Yelp for helping me find Bouchon because the croissants here are to die for. ! At first we each got 1 croissant... but after finishing our croissants we went back to stock up on more for the rest of the day. I'm not someone who enjoys eating any sort of bread, muffin, or pastry...but I seriously can eat 3+ Bouchon croissants in one sitting. Some advice, come here early as the croissants seem to sell out pretty fast. And don't try to buy croissants for the next day. They are edible but just not as good.",positive,restaurant

They are larger and flatter than macaroons from other places. I had to resist myself and only get two, raspberry and pistachio. The raspberry was delicious, but a little on the sweet end. The pistachio was nutty and more true to a real pistachio flavor than most macaroons. The apple croissant was flaky on the outside and full of apples and crumbs on the inside. Bouchon: These were a lot smaller than I had expected and more like a brownie than a fluffy cake that I expected. The ""brownie"" was very rich and delicious! This is definitely a stop on my next visit to Vegas!",positive,restaurant
167969,"Great breakfast! Got a butter croissant and a chocolate croissant for my boyfriend. Both were flaky and soft. The beignets were AMAZING. We split a chocolate and a berry, and both were great. Fluffy, fresh, taaaasty. The chocolate was quite heavy, so maybe better as an afternoon snack than a breakfast, but great with a cup of coffee.

I got the ice cream (bourbon toffee iirc) in a donut. It was good. But I think any store bought ice cream inside of any store bought glazed donut would taste exactly the same. Yummy, sweet, ice cream and donut. Nothing special or unique flavor or texture wise. The donut gets a little soggy. I think they may have heated the donut but I couldn't tell for sure. It was lukewarm. (Not sure how it is supposed to be.. not a criticism just an observation.) I'd get it again if in the area and having a craving for ice cream,",positive,restaurant
168111,"Whether you live in Phoenix or just visiting like us we highly recommend stopping by Novel Ice Cream! This cute little red cottage on Grand Avenue has figured out the way to our hearts - through delicious artisanal ice cream and super friendly service! I had an ice cream stuffed donut and it was incredible. They formulate their donuts to deliberately not detract from the ice cream in any way and it works perfectly. It is a tender, yummy donut, and then it's crammed full of such delicious ice cream! I chose the Honey Lavender, a personal weakness of mine that I like to try wherever I see it. Novel's version is amazing. It has just the right amount of lavender (there is a fine line) and honey. Thom got the butter pecan and loved it. I really love the texture of their ice cream. This is going to be a must stop for us every time we are in town now!!!",positive,restaurant

Cookie Monster with fruity pebbles, 1 with caramel with Cookie Crisp and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles and fruity pebbles. They are all soon good!! I love that the donuts were warm and didn't get hard. We have gone other places that once the ice cream touches it. It's hard as a rock well not here. Ice cream is handmade there and so delicious!!

They have 5 parking spots, or the street, well we went around 7pm and the closest open spot we found was about 10 miles away...ok about 6 blocks away. Not very convenient to walk in a questionable dark neighborhood with little kids. Ice cream was very good, interesting concept on having the ice cream in a hot donut. I had the banana bread pudding in a cup and it was delicious. My daughter tried the honey lavender, she liked it I didn't, but I don't like lavender anything, except for lavender soap . The donut itself was very good, perfect texture and sweetness. I'd definitely go here again but maybe in the day light.",positive,restaurant

168176,"My oh my this place has my heart! Between their homemade ice cream options and their donuts, this place has everything dessert lovers crave. They only offer a few ice cream options and they do the flavors so well they don't need to add any more! We got the sangria sorbet with raspberry drizzle, the honey lavender ice cream, and the Cookie Monster dough melt and all were loved and devoured in less than 5 minutes. The dough melt was the perfect blend of warm and cold and the cookie crumbles on top of the vibrant blue ice cream made it fun to look at as well as eat. Get yourself one and you won't be sorry!",positive,restaurant
168257,"The people who work here are so kind and friendly. I think that's what keeps people coming back for ice cream in the middle of nowhere, where parking sucks and the sun beats down on your back when waiting in line. (It get so hot that they have a cover for the handle and a pad to push the door!) They're known for the dough melt, which is an ice cream scoop in a warm donut bun. This comes with a free topping all for $5.25. They also have the ""Leslie Knope"" (which I wanted to try because Parks & Rec was such a fun show), but I picked the dough melt over it. The dough melt was delicious. I didn't think the donut was too sweet by itself. It was fluffy and chewy at the same time. They let you sample flavors. Vanilla and chocolate were their award winning flavors. I ended up sharing a $5 root beer float with the vanilla ice cream. Other flavors I thought tasted pretty good were caramel toffee crunch, lemon raspberry sorbet, and Cookie Monster. My experience with Cookie Monster is from Afters in Orange County, CA; the ice cream is uber sweet and doesn't really stain your mouth blue. The Cookie Monster ice cream here is not sweet (it's actually a bit thick), but it has multiple toppings in it, like Oreo and brownies. It will stain your tongue blue. When I asked for Oreo topping, the server said it was the ""rightest"" choice! You can come here knowing there is a bit of a wait, but the service here is unlike that of any other business.",positive,restaurant

168349,Visited on a Saturday night. They were very busy. It's a small shop so you might have to wait outside if there's a line inside. I now know what the hype is all about because damn this place is good! I got the chocolate ice cream and it was so good! They won awards for some of their ice cream flavors. The two guys who were working (I think maybe their do-owners?) were so friendly and very personable.,positive,restaurant
168350,"Wow! I can honestly say this is one of my top 2 favorite ice cream places here in Phoenix. You can probably tell since I have so many pictures from my many trips there, HA! They have a few flavors that are always there and the rest are always rotating, so you can always count on trying out something new! The workers are extremely knowledgeable about how each ice cream is made and what ingredients are put into it. The place is pretty small so be prepared to wait outside if there is a line. However, they are relatively quick at getting the ice cream and all the samples out so the line doesn't take that long. The vibe around the stores on the outside is super chill and cute! I've brought a couple friends from out of state here a couple times and they loved it! I highly recommend everyone to try novel ice cream at least once because once you do.... you'll be addicted!",positive,restaurant
168367,"In the past I've always been hesitant to ask for even one sample when I go out for ice cream (I'm not referring to Novel). Sometimes you can just tell that you're annoying the staff for asking for one or multiple samples, but when you walk into Novel Ice Cream that's the first thing you're asked, it's ""what would you like to sample today?"". Although I have my go-to flavor, from talking to the owners and staff I know that a lot of thought goes into the creation of all their crazy delicious and one of a kind flavors and I like having the opportunity to try bits of it. This business not only has great ice cream, they have great service, passion, and the genuine desire to make the experience unique and enjoyable for all.",positive,restaurant
168401,"Just discovered this place on yelp and saw the five stars. It deserves it. I got the dough melt with sweet cream and oreo topping, my wife got the dough melt with chocolate and cocoa pebbles as a topping, her siblings got a cookie monster on a waffle cone, chocolate and Madagascar vanilla in a cup, and strawberry and lemon blueberry sorbet in a cup. We loved everything. So creamy and delicious. That dough melt is just fantastic. Super friendly staff that take pride in their craft. We will be back to try the Leslie Knope! Parks and Rec reference is always a win!",positive,restaurant
168451,"I am a huge ice cream fan and it's my go to when I want to splurge. This place has amazing ice cream with very unique flavors. The gentleman working told us that the creator of the flavors was one of the most decorated in the southwest. I didn't get their signature donut ice cream sandwich, but instead the classic waffle cone and two flavors. I got the honey lavender and fat Elvis, so good. You're in for a real treat.",positive,restaurant
168525,This is the best little spot. The owners are super nice and seems like they care about their business and their customers. My kids absolutely love this ice cream spot and it's location is very cute and easy to find. I'm always looking forward to coming here.,positive,restaurant

168552,"Novel has the best name because that is exactly what it is. It unique and special and like nothing else. The ice cream is really to die for, or kill for if necessary. Then of all things they take the deliciousness and place it between two halves of a warm decadent donut. right? It's a cute tiny shop with a lot to offer. Super customer service the peeps running this show are very cool, and not just cause there is ice cream in there. Don't be a dumb and miss your chance for a mouth pleaser!",positive,restaurant

The chocolate ice cream was very rich and the Cookie Monster ice cream was so blue and yummy. The donut ice cream was so good that we had to order another. Definitely recommend!,positive,restaurant
168740,"We heard about Novel from reviews of the grand avenue festival and decided to give it a try. Wow! I don't ever think I've tasted chocolate ice cream that was as smoooth and rich and creamy as that ever. I really want to try the doughnut ""cone"".",positive,restaurant
168825,"Such a cute little establishment in the Grand Avenue Arts District, downtown! They always rotate their ice cream flavors so you'll always have a new flavor to try. Never thought I'd have lavender flavored ice cream til I stopped here. It's amazing! Add a warm donut to the mix and it's a great way to make anyone's day! The staff are always so friendly and make you feel as if you've known them forever with the way they engage so effortlessly. Definitely a must have if you're ever in the area!",positive,restaurant
168835,"Get the warm donut with your choice of ice cream. It's an amazing combination, they deliver with the donut and the ice cream on so many levels. Super friendly staff as well. Hoping to revisit this place soon. It's a messy but orgasmic ride. Have a lot of napkins ready.",positive,restaurant
168844,"This place is worth all the hype! Brandon was so sweet and let my husband and I try as many flavors as we needed before making our choice, which is hard because all the flavors are delicious! We both ended up going with a donut sandwich and were not disappointed! We will definitely be back!",positive,restaurant
168854,"I would give this shop 5 stars based on the ice cream alone. I'd give it 5 more stars, if I could, for the ice cream donut sandwiches. I'd give it 100 stars for the staff. The dudes that run it are always friendly & seem like they really love what they are doing. There are a lot of places out there that sell good ice cream, but there are so few that do it so well AND with great, unpretentious, customer service. Love 'em. Just absolutely love 'em.",positive,restaurant

168909,"I'm a big supporter of local businesses and this place has all the quirks and charisma of a local dessert shop. It's located in an unsuspecting and hidden corner of town, but finding it is part of the fun! The ice cream filled donuts are ""ahh-mazing!"" And they have gluten free cones! The owners are super nice and genuine and took the time to ensure I found the right dessert to fix my craving. Make sure to check them out if you're in the area!",positive,restaurant
168941,"Novel was a really awesome spot. Was in the downtown area and luckily found this place on Yelp and I am so glad I did. Owners were very well informed and nice. The ice cream was incredible, I had the butter pecan and highly recommend it. 5/5",positive,restaurant

169056,Best ice cream in Phoenix with unique and constantly changing flavors...and two of the sweetest people that own the shop! I feel like family every time I go in. They have only been open for a little over 3 months and I have been here about 5 times! I love bringing out of town visitors here and my boyfriend asks every single week if we can take a walk over to Novel. Highly recommend!,positive,restaurant
169064,"Wanted to treat myself after a half marathon, and this place was perfect for it! It is in such a cool area near downtown... we loved the outdoor seating area under the trees.

169132,"Went here for ice cream. Pretty good ice cream. A bit pricey. But good quality. The salted Carmel ice cream was good, and the little almond pieces of goodness they put on the toffee banofi are out of this world!",positive,restaurant
169247,"Ok...I have no idea what could be said other than ice cream made from real, wholesome ingredients wins over the opposite. Try samples..there weren't too many weird/crazy combinations but I was surprised when I asked what top 2 flavors are (salted caramel & almond butter crunch) Awesome that you can get your icecream scoop in between cookies for a icecream sandwich. Both in our party that chose that option thought the cookie should be warmed a bit. And...toasted home made marshmallow option pretty interesting and tasty too! Will be back!",positive,restaurant
169260,"My daughter and I went to sweet creations after work to get a treat. They had many options to choose from, and my young one was thrilled. We got a 3 scooper (inside secret instead of doing a 2 scoop and 1 scoop). The ice cream was delicious, creamy, and just what we needed. Thanks for letting us try so many flavors!",positive,restaurant
169327,"***Sweet Republic features a wide variety of good ice cream flavors (both traditional flavors and unique ones); this gourmet ice cream parlor also delivers their ice cream into all kinds of desserts including sundaes and shakes; housemade goodies like marshmallows and almond toffee brittle are also available*** Sweet Republic is a gourmet ice cream shop in Scottsdale. This store has a wide variety of ice cream flavors and there are more traditional flavors like chocolate and mint, but there are several unique flavors too like sweet corn and honey blue cheese. Sweet Republic is not simply ice cream in a cup or cone though. This shop also features their ice cream in many different types of desserts like sundaes, shakes and ice cream sandwiches. Other items are available too like nostalgic candy and several housemade goodies that make for nice gifts--like packaged bags of bacon brittle, almond toffee brittle and marshmallows. I tried several of their ice cream flavors. I felt their traditional flavors were decent like Belgian chocolate and salted butter caramel. My favorite flavor I had was their sweet corn. It had a great and very noticeable corn flavor. The consistency of the ice cream was very good. The ice cream was thick and dense as well as very smooth and creamy (with no trace of iciness). The sweet corn did have a few corn kernels mixed into the ice cream, which I thought was unnecessary; it kind of distracted from the very even smoothness of the ice cream. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sweet-republic-scottsdale-2?select=C6qJQ4XVXg3oLRDG38a1ww#I9lsd_IyLbyYzhAlDh0MEg"">yelp.com/biz_photos/swee¦</a> I also tried one of their sundaes, Toffee Banofi, which was featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate. The sundae consisted of two scoops of their Madagascar vanilla ice cream, which was topped with fresh banana, almond toffee brittle, whipped cream, and salted butter caramel sauce. Everything went together very well and all of the toppings were good. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sweet-republic-scottsdale-2?select=C6qJQ4XVXg3oLRDG38a1ww#RreFW96E2_qZMqBPo0rglw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/swee¦</a> The only topping to really stand out though was the almond toffee brittle. It had a great crunch and crispness from both the whole almonds and the brittle. The flavor was very good too--a very nice burnt caramel flavor that was definitely robust and strong without being too bitter. Service was good--pleasant, polite and quick. The store has a very nice interior. It is a pretty big space with a decent amount of seating. The store has a few nice decor touches throughout the room. The decor is not as charming as some of the upscale artisan ice cream shops I have been to, but it is still good and nicer than most ice cream parlors. Prices on the sundaes are pretty expensive. Ice cream by the scoop here is not too pricey though Sweet Republic's prices are similar to other gourmet ice cream shops in big cities. I enjoyed both the ice cream and sundae at Sweet Republic. The flavors were good and the consistency had the thickness, firmness, density, and smoothness that you just do not get at a lot of the major mass market ice cream parlors. I think the flavors are more distinct at ice cream shops like Sweet Rose Creamery (in Brentwood), Carmela (in Pasadena) and Jeni's (in Ohio), but Sweet Republic is definitely worth visiting if you are an ice cream fan and find yourself in the Phoenix or Scottsdale area. Sweet Republic is located in a retail plaza that has its own free parking lot. It is easy finding an open space.",positive,restaurant

When it was time for dessert, we pulled them out and it was as if we had just ordered them. Yummy!",positive,restaurant
169428,"Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy! Needless to say I love Sweet Republic. Needless to say, so do many others judging by the number of positive reviews that came before mine and I couldn't agree more. Nestled in a small strip mall at a corner about less than a mile east of Shea Blvd, you first enter Sweet Republic with their numerous accolades and recognition displayed to your left as well as on a small monitor on your right; so you know many others have discovered and loved Sweet Republic as well. The interior is not huge. I'm guessing they have a capacity to seat about 20 to 25 people, but who cares, you come there for the goodies. My faves are the chocolate sorbet and the coconut sorbet. The chocolate sorbet tastes deeply rich. I haven't tried all the flavors, but why even stop at the ice cream. They have plenty of other treats to try. Please do try the marshmallows and the almond toffee brittle. They have got to be among the best things I have ever eaten. They taste sweet and flavorful and taste fresh. The marshmallows are like no other. These are what marshmallows are supposed to taste like. The almond toffee brittle is easy to bite through and break. If you crave something sweet, Sweet Republic is absolutely a must-visit. I might mention, I've seen supplies of their pint-sized desserts stocked at Whole Foods in Scottsdale as well.",positive,restaurant
169431,"Is ice cream for lunch a bad thing? I don't think so either, especially when it comes from Sweet Republic. What a cool place - how have I survived all this time without coming here? Everything is made in-house from natural ingredients - no crazy things with multiple syllables you can't pronounce. So, I can tell myself it is actually *healthy* kind of like salad but much better tasting. :) The sweet woman behind the counter gave me a couple of samples, and seeing that I really liked them, kept suggesting others to try - ""If you like that, you will love THIS!"" I wanted to leap over the counter and hug her, but somehow managed to restrain myself. I settled on a scoop of vanilla bean and one of sugar n spice, and started a list in my head of the flavors I want to try next (Belgian Chocolate! Real Mint Chip!!). Walking out with my cup clutched in my greedy hands, I was happier than a little kid at recess.",positive,restaurant
169435,"Great service and as always, amazing ice cream. Everything they seem to churn out is amazing. The 16th St location is much closer to me which is great but not so close that I eat there every day.",positive,restaurant
169490,Amazing and unusual flavours are always so mouth-watering. The shop introduces new flavours all the time and it's always fun and exciting to come try new tastes. The staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing. Highly recommended!,positive,restaurant
169494,"They could have come up with a better name, but I am not gonna fault them for that. We were in Scottsdale for a get-away week and I had brought my most recent Sunset Magazine with me to read and lo n behold, they had a little blurb on this joint. We got there about 10 minutes before their 2200 quittin' time. I had the Basil Lime sorbet as well as the fig and bleu cheese ice cream pairing. Wow! These women are brilliant- great job of executing their concept. Now, if they could/would only distribute to San Diego! MMMMMM, Cowboy Ciao for dinner and this place for dessert and Cash Inn Country for a little nightlife. Perfect combination.",positive,restaurant
169549,"My wife and I love Sweet Republic. It's a must try for our out of town guests. I stop by frequently and get pints on my way home from work. So many flavors, such variety. I also work in food service and am picky about health codes (can't help it) and I've never had any problems with SR! Side note: Too many people on here complaining about the prices. If you're willing to spend $5 on coffee, but not on the best ice cream in town, there is something wrong with you.",positive,restaurant
169715,"Sweet Republic lives up to (and surpasses) its hype. I love ice cream. And I really love this ice cream. In the mood for something sweet, my girlfriend and I decided to finally check the place out. We arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday night. It was pretty empty at the time, which actually made the trip even better. The girl at the counter was really nice, and not only did she encourage us to try some samples, but she actually made recommendations of just things to give a quick try. Everything (even the flavor I didn't like) tastes incredibly fresh. She also brought the bowls out to us. A nice little touch of service. We went with a pair of Sundaes; The toffee banofe (if it's the best ice cream Alton Brown has ever ate, then I had to give it a try) and the turtle. The toffee banofe deserves the title of best thing I've ever ate. Vanilla bean ice cream, fresh bananas, toffee whipped cream and caramel. It's salty-bitter-sweet goodness. If I could eat this everyday, I would. The turtle was also amazing. The chocolate, caramel, and nuts all mixed together perfectly. While not as good as the banofe, it was still phenomenal. Sweet Republic's prices aren't exactly cheap, but your sweet tooth will thank you. If you're going to indulge, it might as well be this good. Worth every penny, and then some!",positive,restaurant
169736,"Ever had that moment that left you wanting to keep coming back for more...thats what I get every time I go to this place!! I love it here!! The flavors are unique and well though..the ingredients are organic and taste great. The only thing I dont like is when the owner comes out she hardly smiles...you own the best ice cream shop in the world I expect a smile from ear to ear :) My wife loves the blue cheese ice cream, I'm simple and go for the belgium chocolate in a waffle cone but I've tried almost every flavor except bacon hehe",positive,restaurant

After reading some interesting articles on Sweet Republic, we finally decided to drive on down to Scottsdale and check it out. It''s in a strip mall (of course), and the interior is pretty cute. Modern and clean. Plenty of tables to enjoy your ice cream, and a few scattered outside. Their ice creams are made in house, in small batches, with local, all natural ingredients.

169894,"OhhhhhEmmmmGeeee!!! I totally heart this place!!!! My friends and I came here for the very first time and...it's just...so...heavenly! I just had to try a scoop of the pineapple sorbet and coconut sorbet. It was pleasant. After my friends and I ate our 2 scoops we discovered that this place was actually featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate. First off, vanilla ice cream just sounds so plain and simple. Second, I am so-not into salted sweet stuff (salted butter caramel just doesn't sound pleasing to my taste buds). But we went ahead and ordered the Toffee Banofi Sundae which is consisted of double scoop vanilla bean with fresh bananas, toffee butter crunch, salted butter caramel and whipped cream (Alton Brown's recommendation - Food Network). You've got to put each little pieces of heaven in each spoon and savor the flavor! The combination of all these goodness is so perfectly put together. It's going to be hard to imagine eating ice cream else where. This place totally rocks! I have to also admit that sometime it may seem that Yelpers might bring too much of a hype on some places, but you really never know unless you try. Even though some recommendations don't necessarily sound pleasing to your senses, you should have an open taste bud to try new things because you can discover something quite heavenly (it may shock you). Try this place if you haven't...it's seriously delicious!!!",positive,restaurant

I've passed down Shea so many times on my visits to Scottsdale.. however would have never even seen this place had I not been bored one evening and doing a search for ice cream in the area. Lo and Behold.. Sweet Republic. Granted I think some flavors are more tasty than others.. but that's pretty much ice cream for you, It's really just personal preference and your taste that day. I thought for sure the Salted Caramel would do it.. but not today. I had the Banana Foster in a cup. However on my drive back to Tucson, I was thinking hhmmm maybe would have been good with some hot fudge too! I guess it'll have to wait until my next trip. Definitely will be back.",positive,restaurant
169949,"ummmmmmm, I mean yummmmmmmmm. Look out Ben & Jerry's! I just finished dinner at Jade Palace and saw a sign in the window above the restaurant. Ice Cream!!!! Who am I to pass this up? When I walked into Sweet Republic I felt partly like I was in a hands on exhibit at a local child's museum. The walls were fun to touch and the design was very trendy. And according to Helen one of the co-owners, every detail was looked at for the best product they could use from low emission paints to recycled plants to make the table tops. It looks like a cool place to hang out. NOW the most important part of the store. The Home Made Ice Cream!!!! The creamiest ice cream I've had in a long time. Very flavorful, the pumpkin spice was to die for. It tasted like pumpkin pie. And the praline was decadent. Then I bought a chocolate chip, walnut oatmeal cookie for $1.00. And she even heated it up for me. All I can say is don't walk over there, RUN!!!! IT'S THAT GOOD!",positive,restaurant
169974,"This place is preeeetty neat. I got the Almond Buttercrunch and it was so good; packed with almonds, creamy. My husband was adventurous and got the famout cheese course duo which is blue cheese and dates. Sounds funny, but my husband (who loves blue cheese), loved it and got it after sampling it. I got mine in a waffle cone which was perfectly buttery and not too crunchy..yum! It is such an interesting concept of ""artisan style ice cream,"" they ripen their own fruit on the counter, they use all fresh ingredients, no wonder it's good. I really want to try their fruity flavors next time, like cantaloupe. They also had delicious looking ice cream cookie sandwiches if you are fan. The people are so sweet, and they also have classic board games to entertain oneself, including ""Connect 4!""",positive,restaurant

Got to rub elbows with the rich n famous ;) no....more like gawk at their beautiful bougie vehicles rolling down the street. Anywaysssss...... I'm not much of a sweets kinda girl but I do love my Sprinkles. THIS is something that I'm willing to sacrifice my calories on. My favorites are: red velvet (of course) and strawberry. I've tried the Cuban coffee and it was just too sweet. Also, on St Patrick's Day, they turn their red velvet cupcakes to......GREEN velvet cupcake!!! It tastes exactly the same as your normal red velvet but being that green is one of my fav colors....this was freakin awesome!!! They have monthly specials too.

Missing its chance to trademark ""The Happiest Place on Earth,"" a sentiment seemingly shared by girls behind the counter and two youngsters with whom I waited in a line of just one before us, it was after a short bit of deliberation that a sizable order was crafted, the boxed and bagged sweets taken home for later indulgence while a delicious Apple Pie Sundae was upgraded to a cupcake sandwiched special, the first bites a tad too sweet with frosting while further mixing uncovered a beautiful sort of balance, the spicecake and graham cracker crumbles melding nicely with whipped cream and butterscotch amidst some of the creamiest fruit-focused ice cream around. Waiting until around 3pm for the rest, four cupcakes along with a brownie and six pints of ice cream given to me as a gift obviously far too much for one man to enjoy, it was with alternating bites that various items were sampled and with the oddly artificial tasting banana ice cream lone exception to items crafted from superior ingredients the results of everything else were decidedly quite excellent, the bruleed marshmallow fluff of a S'mores cupcake mellowing the bittersweet chocolate center atop a crunchy graham cracker base while Black & White riffed successfully on the deli cookie classic, the best bites of ice cream a tough decision between milk chocolate punched up with malt balls and aforementioned apple pie. ***** Rare to support an outsider over locals, and equally skeptical of high prices based on branding and swanky design, it remains difficult to find fault in a company that has continued to improve its standards despite mass expansion, a rare case where a once trendy choice has aged well with the times.",positive,restaurant
170230,"I think the ""Brand"" makes them taste better than they really are. Don't get me wrong, they're good, but the price doesn't justify the taste. We came in tonight (a Tuesday) 10minutes before they closed. We grabbed our cupcakes 1st. The girl (Might be named Patricia, because that's what our receipt said (asian/Filipino)) at the counter seemed miserable. She slouched, didn't smile and was just such a downer. That was a bummer, because I was really excited that we made it in before they closed. I had promised my toddler a cupcake after dinner, but he ended up falling asleep before we got to Sprinkles. Anywho she kind of killed our excitement, but luckily the girls (Z Cupcak) over on the Ice Cream side were SOOOO nice, and got us back into an excited mood. They were so friendly like the Sprinkles staff we're used to. Our local shop is in Newport Beach and they are always great! We ordered the Capt'n Crunch flavored Ice Cream. The 1st bite was amazing, but unfortunately the Cap'n Crunch flavor didn't last through out the whole cone. I dont know if it was just me, but it ended up just tasting like vanilla after a couple bites. All in all it was a good visit because my son was happy with his after dinner late night treat. ............ Thank you to the girls on the Ice Cream side for being so ""sweet"", and making us feel like valued customers.",positive,restaurant

I am not a sweet tooth kind of person but when it comes to these I am all about it. They are perfectly moist inside and the frosting is so eloquently placed on top with the perfect amount. Personally, I prefer the cupcakes that have a cream cheese frosting but I've had both.

I tried the carrot, lemon, red velvet, and strawberry cupcakes and I loved every one of them. I find that most cupcakes either have a great cake or a great icing but THESE CUPCAKES...they have the perfect creamy/buttery icing and moist cake with just the right icing to cake ratio.

I had a Red Velvet waffle cone with Red Velvet ice cream and my husband had an Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich with one chocolate chip and one Snickerdoodle cookie with vanilla ice cream in between. Seriously, heaven.",positive,restaurant
170777,"The service was friendly and my gluten free red velvet cupcake was delicious! My husband also enjoyed his regular carrot cake cup cake. They even had milk which was the perfect compliment! We would go back. Their prices were comparable to any other gourmet cupcake place I have been to in New York City, Nebraska, and Colorado.",positive,restaurant
170790,"Although I don't visit cupcake shops as often as I did before I still consider myself to be a cupcake connoisseur. Finally the infamous Sprinkles opens in Vegas. I have been here 3 times already and I can say the best thing I got from here is the Sprinkles Sundae, which consisted of carrot cupcake and salted caramel ice cream. Absolutely amazing! The best carrot cupcake I've had and that certainly means a lot considering I've tried carrot cupcakes from multiple cupcake places (Cupcake Station from Michigan and Kara's Cupcakes in San Francisco). The thing that makes Sprinkles' carrot cake so unique is the long strands of carrot, om nom nom. The salted caramel ice cream is divine as well, if you are a caramel fan. The consistency of the ice cream is really smooth, almost like gelato, but not quite there. I've ordered the salted caramel ice cream on it's own and yes it is a bit salty, but if you have it with a cupcake it is delicious. The people working at ice cream section even warn you that it's salty by itself so I highly recommend having it with something else. My first visit I had lemon meringue cupcake with vanilla ice cream which was just a okay, but nothing to run home about. I am certainly a fan now, however when I first tried Sprinkles at their original Beverly Hills location I didn't enjoy it as much. The location is really pretty since it is located at the Linq. The staff members are all nice and helpful. There is a cupcake ATM present, however I would just prefer to go inside since the cupcakes should be more fresh from there.",positive,restaurant
170802,Had a ice cream sandwich. Snicker doodle with cap'n crunch. I liked the overall feel of the place they had a cupcake ATM which I thought was adorable. I heard the cupcakes were good going to have to try them on my next time round. Overall pretty impressed with the quality of the ice cream and the flavor variety definitely a spot I would check out again.,positive,restaurant
170906,Love love love that this place is available to feed my sugar addiction. Yes I know that it's on the strip. But sometimes those urges drive me to make the journey from henderson. I tried the coffee fudge almond ice cream with the red velvet cone. It was the perfect size to share with my man who only eats a few bites and leaves the rest to me to finish. If you're ever in the mood for yummy ice cream and don't mind driving to the strip then this is the place to go. I will be back to try the cupcakes... YUMM!!!,positive,restaurant
170926,"I love this place, I used to watch cupcakes wars on the food network channel so I know a little about the founder. When I found out they were opening one in vegas I was so exited !!! I have came in a couple times and every time I go I love the employees they're so helpful and friendly. I always get the red velvet ice cream, with red velvet cupcake pieces inside. I recently tried the oatmeal salted cookie. Omg I love it. It's worth the try.",positive,restaurant
170953,Delicious! I especially enjoyed the toaster marshmallows. Such a yummy treat :) And the bubbly tea was refreshing.,positive,restaurant
171090,"Had to give this place a try after seeing it noted on multiple ""must try"" boards on Pinterest. You know, do it for the instagram photo. Ha. Ha. The shop is tucked away, simple exterior and interior. I think I was expecting something a little more decorated but there wasn't anything wrong with this shop. The gal who made my dessert was on the phone at the same time - something about their internet being down/not working. Opted to try their special - scoop of dulce di leche ice cream, in a waffle bowl, with a caramel macaron and a toasted mallow on top!! The ice cream was so creamy and flavorful. The macaron wasn't dry and brittle, just enough crunch and chew. The toasted mallow on top was gooey and yummy. Was a nice little detour for the instagram photo and sweet tooth craving, but - it will set you back about $8.",positive,restaurant
171151,"After a giant meal at a KBBQ, my little group of friends wanted to grab some dessert. It was pretty difficult since it's New Years and lots of places we wanted to go to were closed. However, my cousin suggested this place and i'm so glad she did! The combination of ice cream, macaroon, and toasted marshmallow is absolutely amazing. I decided on coffee and chocolate ice cream with a vanilla macaroon (a giant one too!); I felt heaven in that cookie cup. Would definitely go again(:",positive,restaurant
171212,"Super fun place - location is just in a small strip mall but the staff is friendly and let you try various ice creams before buying. Get the cup with ice cream, macaroon and marshmallow. Pretty cool when they are making it and toast it. Awesome experience for young kids especially and super tasty ice cream. Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream and cherry swirl were so good!!! I don't think you can go wrong here.",positive,restaurant
171227,What a great place!! Such delicious ice cream and who doesn't love Pinguins! Huge shame the location is so utterly hidden. Cool artwork as well. Definitely will be back!,positive,restaurant
171295,"Quick service, clean, and amazing ice cream and macarons. The cookie cup is a must have when visiting here. The ice cream, macaron, and toasted marshmallow is really a combination like no other. Each ingredient complimented the other. Already wanting to go back.",positive,restaurant
171341,Love!! We ordered 2 Mini Daddy's and it was perfect!! Everything was fresh and delicious. Will definitely be a repeat customer.,positive,restaurant
171528,I love fatty daddy's! They have several gluten free options too!! The cookie cup is really flavorful. There are plenty of options to change it up each time. My one problem is there's only one person working at a time so if you come at a time when it's busy be prepared to wait.,positive,restaurant
171543,"85C is a mandatory stop at Shanghai Plaza. My family, friends and colleagues love the pastries. We would have a box of 85°C at my work's break room and conference room at least twice a month lol. Selection: Assorted pastries are freshly baked and more affordable than other bakeries. It seems like there are always new goodies every time we visit. The beverage menu was just decent, we enjoyed the iced coffee and sea salt jasmine iced tea. We really just come here for the pastries lol Service: Staff is friendly, also hardworking! They would come in and out to restock the pastries as some of the goodies get sold within minutes of after the previous restock lol! Parking: FREE. Shanghai Plaza parking lot just outside the bakery. We prefer parking in the back at W Pioneer Ave. & Arville St. then just stroll around the plaza since it gets really packed in the front. Highly recommend!",positive,restaurant
171554,"Love this bakery! This is one of my stop every time we go to California I'm glad they are here! First let me tell you how nice and friendly the People are! I want to mention the guy who helped me about my drink the tea I wanted was not Available so he recommended something to go with my tea and came out really good and refreshing! So whoever you are that helped me and my friend and make sure that our drink tasted good thank you! I also got some pastries which all of then are good from the green tea bread, blueberry, sausage cheese bread etc! All of them are good!",positive,restaurant
171626,Absolutely perfect. I could eat the toro alll day. The texture is irresistible. Can't wait to tell all my friends about this unique dessert. Not too sweet either.,positive,restaurant
171661,"Welcome to Las Vegas 85C Bakery Cafe, we've been waiting for our Brioche Loaf, Berry Tale, Iced Sea Salt Coffee and all your delicious bread, cakes and pastries for a long time in the greater Las Vegas metropolitan area for years! For those who are not aware what the Hype is about. This particular brand of Bakery has been setting up shop throughout the United States in the past years and have been a huge success because of its price point and delicious items which combines the flavors of Europe and Asia. There is so much to choose from and the shelves are replenish throughout the day. From flavored bread/loaf to pastries like buns filled with berries or mango to ham and cheese croissant. They also sale cake slices and round cakes of various flavors from Tiramisu, Red Velvet, Strawberries and Mango. I've been a fan since visiting their locations throughout the Southern California region for years. How does it work? Upon entering you get a tray and add a paper liner and set of tongs to picked your items that are enclosed in cubicles of plastics stack against the wall and windows. Then you stand in land to get them package with plastic or in a paper box depending your preference. FYI, they have an automatic machine where you can place drink(s) or cake orders for pick up so you don't need to wait in line. Is something I recommend. However, your able to place your drink order when your at the cashier. For the many one star reviews listed, many of the posted reviews deals with the frustrations from the recent soft opening and crazy grand opening weekend. Those folks choose to visit and vent their frustrations which I completely understand but I would advise others that they have been super duper busy these past weeks and according to the staff that I've spoken too, it's been non-stop. So do plan ahead and be patient with the staff. This is the very first location in Las Vegas and the state of Nevada. They have a lot to improve on but honestly they've been doing a good job. FYI: -85C Bakery started in Taiwan and entered the United States market in 2008 with their very first location in Irvine, CA. and it continues to grow with more locations. -Affordable, it's one of the main draw as to why this Bakery have gained a huge following from the public and its common to see customers hoarde or haul like my FamBam, LoL. -It's Known as the, ""Starbucks of Taiwan!"" 2019 Yelp Review #16",positive,restaurant
171723,So happy to have ran into this location while visiting Vegas. We have this bakery back home in San Diego so I was so glad to have found one . I called my order ahead of time and picked it up the same day .,positive,restaurant
171747,"FINALLY went & checked out 85's Las Vegas location! And I am so glad I went. We went on a Sunday, right around 5:30pm and it was PACKED! But they have a simple system in place to keep the lines moving in an organized fashion. One of the items I specifically went in for (the Marble Taro) was out on the shelves & I was soooo bummed. Then I spotted it at the front, FRESH, straight outta the oven goodness & asked one of the workers if I could snag a couple and she was quick to help me out. They are managed so well with such orchestrated precision to make your experience well worth your time. The quality of products, the excellent customer service & the affordability is just fire !!",positive,restaurant
171750,"This place is amazing. I have never been disappointed in any aspect, from products to service. The marble taro loaf is incredible! So many different items to choose from that are absolute delicious. Love, love, love the egg tarts! And the prices are incredibly reasonable. I usually stuff a box full of different breads and never spend more than $23. I really wish this franchise came further east than the CA/NV area. At certain times of day, be prepared for a line out the door. It's best to get there early before 9am. Otherwise the place gets so packed it's hard to move around inside with your tray and tongs. Enjoy the ""FRESH BREAD!"" and get out of their way when you hear it, because they're comin' in hot!",positive,restaurant
171807,Got the coffee cake and it has good coffee flavor. Tried my friend's mango cake and it's very refreshing. We didn't get any bread bc that line was too long. But I'm excited that we have one now. Don't have to stop by the ones in SoCal anymore.,positive,restaurant
171838,Sea salt caramel iced coffee paired with their egg tart! What else can you ask for? I highly recommend their mango tale and berry tale as well!,positive,restaurant
171914,Love it. Glad one finally opened out here. Love the garlic cheese bread and the cheese bites. I went during the grand opening and it was a bit crowded. I plan to visit again to try the teas.,positive,restaurant
171921,The place is great . The pastries are amazing . It's so good there's lines out the door . Tired of all the complainers on here whining about long lines and bad service. It's called busy you entitled fart faces. This is a great addition to the neighborhood!,positive,restaurant
172110,"Very cute little spot just off of Roosevelt. I love the presentation of the ice cream in Chinese take out boxes, complete with fortune cookies. Love the flights, a sampling of five flavors plus fortune cookies presented in a muffin pan ($7.50). Love the dog friendly outdoor seating. And, most importantly, love the ice cream. My favorite ice cream flavor this visit? Peanut butter & jelly. Not the most juvenile flavor we ordered believe it or not. Those were Captain Crunch-berry and Lucky Charm based flavors ordered by the kids. Fear not. There are numerous choices for the adult palate as well.",positive,restaurant
172150,Best icecream ever! Would definitely recommend this to everyone. They got tons of unique ice cream flavors. My favorite is their grasshopper mint!,positive,restaurant
172158,melt is my favorite ice cream spot ever. the people whom work here are very friendly. the flavors are very unique. if you use your credit/debit card you get points toward a free ice cream. the presentation of the ice cream is very unique the serve it to you in a chinese food togo box it's very different and fun if your in phoenix and want something different try melt.,positive,restaurant
172164,"Quaint little ice cream place on Roosevelt. Line was a little long, but it went by fast. We went late at night, so some things (like the waffle bowl) weren't available, but none the less still a lot of unique flavors to choose from. Good presentation, excellent taste, and great pricing for the amount they serve. The two guys working that night also had excellent customer service. Will return soon!",positive,restaurant
172220,"I wish there was a 4.5 star option. Took my family here based in reviews I've seen on Yelp. Neat atmosphere, I like the Chinese food boxes and the fortune cookies, and the staff. Only (minor) complaints I would have are that it needs a little bit if upkeep and there needs to be a better balance of weird flavors to traditional flavors. Too many of the flavors sound just to scary for me. My favorite ice cream flavor is strawberry. Unfortunately the only strawberry flavor they had was strawberry-jalapeno...I'll pass. Wound up getting good old fashioned vanilla which was yummy. Be creative with your flavors, but don't be too crazy!",positive,restaurant

172348,"This is the cutest little ice cream shop! I stopped in one night at around 11pm stemming from an intense need to get out of the house, and have something sweet. My boyfriend and I get there, after not finding it so easily and missing the turn about three times, and wait in the short line. I was disappointed that they didn't have any frozen yogurt at the time, but I chalked it up to it being so late. I get the lavender ice cream and my boyfriend gets his favorite- pistachio. It's the creamiest ice cream served in a little Chinese food takeaway container topped with a fortune cookie. It was delicious and cute as heck. On top of that, we got lucky as the three neighborhood cats came and stopped by and hung out with us as we sat outside on the cute little patio. Not to mention the cute free stickers! I wish I would've taken 10 of them! Not to mention the gentleman working let us take an extra ""bowl"" so we could have the little memento at home. 10/10 experience! Love this place!",positive,restaurant
172354,"I heard about this place in an article for the top 10 ice-cream places to cool down in the U.S. and was surprised I hadn't heard of it before. I biked down there on Monday night because they're open late and saw the shoppe in an old house in the Roosevelt district. There were two cute cats by the front door to greet us as we walked in. I had the Superfarm and my co-conspirator had the coffee. Both were delicious, served in a chinese-take out container and with a fortune cookie! Can't wait to go back.",positive,restaurant
172368,Fruity Pebbles ice cream changed my life. You can literally smell the waffle cones being made as you approach the street this little gem is located on. Can't wait to go back!,positive,restaurant
172426,Delicious. This is the best donut store I have found since moving. The store has so many unique flavors and designs that anyone should be satisfied. On top of all of this the prices is great. One suggestion I would make is that if you want to get donuts from here be prepared to get up early. The donuts sell out quickly.,positive,restaurant
172460,"Absolutely Love Jack Frost! I stop here a few Sundays a month to take a dozen to my Mom, she lives in Medina and Loves them too! Not only are their donuts fresh, but the staff is Super friendly! Get here early because there is always a line!!",positive,restaurant
172476,The best donuts ever made!!!! I drive to Cleveland just to get them !!! They taste as good as the look. Friendly staff and great prices,positive,restaurant
172499,"I love how much effort they put into their creations. Their doughnuts are works of art! Even just looking at them is a treat, let alone eating them. My thought for improvement is to label the doughnuts. It takes too much time having to wait for every one in front of you to ask questions. Then it's your turn and you have to ask. They would definitely increase sales with simple labels. Nevertheless, I will be returning!",positive,restaurant
172551,"Best donuts on the earth! Fresh daily, amazing combinations and award winning! LOVE, LOVE!!!!",positive,restaurant
172617,"Donuts were amazing!! The filling and the icing were so tasty. If you're looking for a place that has cake donuts, this is the one for you!",positive,restaurant
172749,"Wish I could give 6 stars! Amazing donuts. We got there around 10 am- rookie move as selection picked over and they apparently don't replenish- what they have is what they sell. Still had enough interesting varieties to make it worth the drive. Don't overlook the glazed- simple but better than any we'd ever had. The kinds with lots of frosting were, as expected, a big hit. Good service, great donuts- what else do you need??",positive,restaurant

172861,Best Ice cream in the city! Gooey butter cake is amazing and the handmade waffle cones put it all together.,positive,restaurant
172870,"So many options! I can't even stand it. I asked how many I could try and the lovely girl behind the counter told me ""1,000"". Perfect. She was so nice, and let me try as many flavors as I wanted so I could narrow down my choices. I settled on the gooey butter cake and OMG, I'm in love. It was so delicious. I really like everything I tried, but this was magnificent. The waffle cone was good, but a little rich for me, so next time I may get a different type. The staff was awesome! I will definitely be back! Great experience.",positive,restaurant
172930,"So glad we waited in line for this place! The line kind of took us for surprise. However, we are nearing the end of summer & school will soon resume. This the fleet of teens, babies, & your daddy. Upon getting to the top of the line, the employees were so excited even after getting through the lines. They were encouraging that we taste all the flavors we were interested about. Again: keep in mind the lines were long. They were not pushy at all. My roommates & I opted for the waffle cones you can smell from outside the establishment. It's very sweet. I love sweet but it's definitely sweet. I got a standard ooey gooey butter. I'm still on cloud nine you guys. Then my bf couldn't finish...so I devoured his strawberry buttermilk. Living my best life. All in all, go to Jeni's. No doubt you will find something for you & the family. Enjoy you guys...",positive,restaurant

172975,"Jeni's is just what Charlotte needed. It's in South End of Charlotte which is such a great location as there are many locals and is a popular area of Charlotte. The ice cream is absolutely creamy and smooth, refreshing, flavorful and truly splendid. There are soo many to choose from and the flavors are unique as well. Very much different from other ice cream places in Charlotte. Jeni's is pricey, but you pay for the quality and I think it's definitely worth the price. The waffle cones are amazing and they're freshly made. My favorite flavor is the Brambleberry Crisp- you have to try this, especially if you love berries. Definitely try Jeni's if you're in the area and looking for a cold/sweet treat.",positive,restaurant
172991,Great ice cream as usual! They even had someone in the line taking orders if you knew what you wanted ahead of time (which we didn't) but it is still great to see an express option because of how long the lines usually get. Jeni's is also VERY allergy friendly. My wife had a lot of food allergies but every time we go by they are still always able to accommodate and make her feel important. Check out Jeni's if you are coming through Charlotte! Awesome location and great place to visit in the summertime.,positive,restaurant
173019,Great selection of ice cream. The wait was a bit too long to get the the front of the line. The price is on the high side.,positive,restaurant
173060,"The ice cream is the best. There are lots of unusual flavors to choose from. My last trip I had goat cheese and cherry. The creaminess is well balanced. The smell of the fresh made waffle cone brings back memories of childhood ice cream cones at the lake. I have recommended this shop to friends and they always thank me. My one friend now has it delivered to her home. Oh my goodness, I hadn't thought of that!",positive,restaurant

173261,"SO into Mitchell's I immediately had to write about it. First and most important--this ice cream is THE BOMB. I know this probably going to sound like a bold statement but it might be the best ice cream I've ever had. At least the best Rocky Road and the best Banana Pie ice cream I've ever had. I did a taster's cup of the two flavors and they paired perfectly together and did my mouth very well. Creamy, the right amount of flavor and mixins, natural banana (the artificial stuff is the worst) and a good, deep chocolate base for the Rocky Road. Yes yes yes. The staff here is real nice and the gal was very patient as I struggled to pick a flavor (it's pleasantly overwhelming). Tried the two I went with and was sold. The space is so cute--the marquee out from repurposed from the old theatre that I think they've converted to the shop (locals, don't hold it against me if I'm wrong on that). The space is really huge with tons of lovely natural light plus communal tables for seating. There's even a row of lower counters and small chairs for kids. Behind the counters are huge windows where you can see the ice cream in production. Which is pretty neat if you're into that sort of thing (which I am). Take a pint to go (I wish it would last for my 3 hour drive back home) and get some of their peanuts/chocolate sauce/etc to go to make your own sundaes at home. They also have cakes and cones to take home as well. Or just eat in and go to town on their myriad of awesome flavors.",positive,restaurant
173279,"I have lived in another city where I did not eat my favorite dessert, Icecream, because there was just not good selection. I have to say the first time I built my bravery to try Mitchell's I was pleasantly surprised. Now it is my second favorite Icecream company! Simply delicious!",positive,restaurant
173311,"We did a Google search to find the best ice cream in Cleveland, and it directed us to Mitchell's. What a fantastic recommendation. We had cotton candy ice cream, which took me right back to my childhood, and strawberry cheesecake ice cream. The girls that worked there were so friendly and allowed us to sample different flavors. Overall a wonderful experience!",positive,restaurant
173312,childhood memories.....................................................................................................................................................................................................,positive,restaurant
173339,"By far the best place I've ever had ice cream. All fresh, and homemade. At this location you can see the production facility where the ice cream is all made. They do an outstanding job of always having different, seasonal options available. My personal favorites have been the strawberry rhubarb crisp and the key lime pie, both summer seasonals. My fiance is a big fan of the campfire s'more, another summer seasonal. I always get the waffle cone, because the servings here are pretty large, and seem to fit in the waffle cone a little better. Be prepared to wait a little to get your ice cream because there is almost always a line here, but it keeps moving. It is a little more than you plan to pay for ice cream, but definitely worth the price. You can buy ice cream to go, where they will give you dry ice and a small cooler to travel, we have used this to send a gift to family in Buffalo, NY. Best ice cream I've had anywhere. Always an option to stop in while we're visiting West 25th.",positive,restaurant
173364,"It's rare to find ice cream better than Mitchell's! The location is adorable-an old theater. The marquee on the outside announces the seasonal flavors. Mitchell's always allows you to sample any and all ice creams that you're interested in. My favorites are key lime pie, coconut chocolate chunk and porter chocolate chunk. If you take a pint or a quart to go, complimentary ice cream cones are included. You can enjoy your treat on the second floor overlooking the kitchen where cooks are constantly working to make ice cream. Their hours are also great. They're open late so you can stop in after dinner, the bar or a concert. Mitchell's is a stop everyone must make when they're in Cleveland!",positive,restaurant
173449,"We had to go to this ice cream place while in Cleveland. We like to go to homemade ice cream places all over the country. It was neat that it was in an old theater. It was also cool to see them making the ice cream behind the glass, if you go upstairs you can get a better view of it. I forget all the flavors I had but I had 3 different flavors in a waffle cone. I think I got some type of chocolate chunk, and a coffee chocolate. It was very creamy and delicious. The waffle cone was fresh as well. Wanted to make a 2nd trip back but didn't get to it, but we got a couple cups of Mitchell's ice cream at our hotel.",positive,restaurant
173464,So delicious. Many great flavors. High quality ice cream. Mitchell's might be the best place to get ice cream.,positive,restaurant
173498,"Mitchell's is the place to be whether it is the winter or summer! This ice cream chain in Cleveland is so special. It's homemade batches are filled with flavors you'll cherish long after they melt in your mouth. The cost is a little high, but not terrible considering all the ingredients are fresh and most local! Support this gem and enjoy some ice cream :)",positive,restaurant
173502,"Really delicious. They let you taste different ones. Rhubarb crumble was good but too sweet. The caramelized chocolate seemed ordinary to me. But the vegan butter pecan, made with coconut milk, was amazing. And I also liked the peanut butter chocolate chunk.",positive,restaurant
173528,"As far as ice cream goes, this is where it's at! This review is brought to you buy someone who isn't even that into ice cream. If you gave me the option of desserts, ice cream would be at the bottom of my list. BUT, not this ice cream, its more than just ice cream, its magic! My favorite flavor is the Banana Cream Pie! It has homemade marshmallows, organic bananas, and homemade shortbread cookies layered throughout a delicious banana flavored ice cream. Sometimes i like to pair it with the chocolate peanut butter cup ice cream. This location is where they make their ice cream, and you get the joy of watching them make it if you see fit. You can walk around on the main floor, or take the stairs, or elevator up to a loft area and watch them do their magic! Worth the short walk from the Westside Market, or really from anywhere. Go check it out!!!",positive,restaurant
173571,"Came here a few weeks ago on a weeknight, loved it. I tried the salted caramel (very smoky, but good) and peanut butter cup (even better). They have plenty of options and offer free samples to taste before selecting your flavor, which is helpful. Love the space inside. Definitely recommend.",positive,restaurant
173575,"Advice: A single scoop is big enough to share. See if you can ask for a half scoop of one flavour and a half scoop of another if you originally wanted to try two different flavours. We got a scoop of caramelized chocolate and a scoop of the wild berry crumble and one scoop each was too much for the both of us. The ice cream shop is an old theatre converted to an ice cream manufacturing facility and store front that's got a great facade, drawing in a steady stream of customers on a warm summer's day.",positive,restaurant

173765,"pleasure of ice cream a treasure on the two five respite of flavor A new feather in the Ohio City neighborhood's cap. Mitchell's Ice Cream opened yesterday in the creepy old Moda space that, previous to that debacle, was a movie theater. The ice cream parlor area in the front starts with a cafeteria style line of ice creams, followed by a freezer full of ice cream cakes and pies, half gallons, and pints. Pints being ""convenient single serve containers"" in my book. There is a cute train that runs the perimeter of the ceiling. You can get a view of the production area through the glass partition walls. The old building's ceilings and rafters are exposed. And the re-hab of the space was done in a green and environmentally conscious way. With all of the designer ice creams out there, each ostensibly richer and sometimes weirder than the last, this stuff is not that at all. Yes, they focus on using local dairy and fruit products, but the ice cream itself is not soooo rich and fatty that your cholesterol spikes. It does not leave your mouth all slimy with butterfat. It. Is. Perfect. I had the ""trio of tastes"" in a cup. Banana Cream Pie, GLBC Stout with chocolate, and Rum Bobka, that was made to coincide with the shops Dyngus Day opening. Lord have mercy. I've eaten Mitchell's before, but the Rum Bobka was out of this world. The stout/chocolate had a rich coffee like flavor, and the banana cream pie had some salty bits of shortbread crust through it. Oh man... ...no words... And take note of this. After obviously throwing down hard to revamp the space, and having a live 3 piece trio playing to boot, ALL sales from the opening day are donated to two Ohio City charities, Providence House, and Malachi's. Mitchell's is a class act, and a tremendous addition to the area. Oh yeah. WAFFLE CONES!!! Carry on...",positive,restaurant
173797,"Their baked goods and pastries are to die for!!! The cake with strawberries is my go to and their lattes are refreshing as well. Don't really enjoy the food to be honest,but I frequent this bakery for its breads, cakes, and cookies!! Such a pleasant cafe in Little Italy to go with friends, for a date, and even by yourself to get some work done.",positive,restaurant
173822,"I love their date and nut bars... But something in the process of making these former favorited delights must've changed, as I experienced biting into hard bits of shell on two different occasions. I sent them a message on FB but perhaps the didn't read it, as I didn't get a reply. Oh what to do. I still recommend the chocolate dipped cannolis, but as November is upon us, I have to remind everyone that Presti's personal sized pumpkin pies are precisely the splurge for the self-loving needed to DEAL with the upset of seasonal climate change. Winter is coming, but so are these limited-time-only pies. If you're lucky to have one (all for yourself), buy an extra one to-go. Take one now, and another in the evening, before bed... With every bite, pause to think about what you love about being you. Once the last morsel is gone, think about what you love about living in Cleveland. Remember these things when you're shoveling snow. If you come in a day too late, all that will be left is some pouting about, waiting for a whole 'nother year until it's time for November pie again. Come get this pie. Sadly, I am in Oklahoma and Florida for all of November. You are not me. You are better than me. I am (hopefully) receiving mine in the mail. Presti's pumpkin pie, AKA November pie.. Not to be confused with Patterson's Fruit Farm pies.. which are also wonderful pies, available year round... read about it on Yelp ;)",positive,restaurant
173924,"Sweets were pricey but didn't try. I didn't expect anything out of their savory food because I just wanted a quick bite for dinner but my dad and I got a pizza which was ok/solid, pasta which was good, and the stromboli was amazing!!! It was just presented on the side of the place and we said screw it just microwave it for us but it ended up tasting super good? Meat strombolis are good but for some reason I reallllly liked the veggie one. Highly recommend.",positive,restaurant
174010,"Presti's never ever disappoints. Cheap food ($1.50 for a piece of pizza), and fantastic quality. Casual dining, great atmosphere. Stromboli, cannoli, EVERYTHING is yummy. Cons? None, but always take a number when you come in for fast service!",positive,restaurant

174051,"We took a number from a number dispenser not unlike one that you'd find in your local license bureau and neatly shuffled behind the hungry Saturday night crowd that flocked to this bakery. It took maybe 10-15 minutes total, which is not bad for THAT kind of crowd. We went home with our precious Tiramisu and other baked goods. As far as Tiramisus go, this one was among the airiest, fluffiest and most delicate ones I've tried. I'd say it's up there with the best I had. Easy to inhale. This is a great place for dessert and perhaps, paradise if you have a sweet tooth.",positive,restaurant
174075,"The service can be slow if they're busy so this is not a place to stop for something quick. They have a huge selection of Italian pastries, cakes, breads, slices of pizza, and prepared foods. Their cappuccino is fabulous and topped with cinnamon. We loved the chocolate cannoli cake, what I would consider a chocolate version of cassata cake. Their anise cookies were also great. Down fall, was that the cannoli were filled and sitting in the case not filled to order for ideal texture and flavor.",positive,restaurant
174101,Large italian bakery cleveland little italy Went on a Sunday 1130 am..busy as you would expect... but within 5 minutes got my coffee and tiramisu... great choice for brunch!

Recommend!,positive,restaurant
174242,"Presit's has an excellent feel and ambiance to it...I love the wall-to-wall window scape of Mayfield road and the options from Cold Pizza to taste bud infused Gelato. The lines can be long, but it's worth the wait and also the chocolate chip cannoli is great for a take home to mom. One little thing they do...they have free water in a lemonade machine for hot summer days and those who need to flush down their sweet tooth. A must go to if your in Little Italy.",positive,restaurant
174246,Love this place but it can get busy. We go here for the DONUTS. They are so delish! Took a star off because your staff needs to learn how to make a proper cappuccino. Foam peaks and foam spilling onto the side of cup is not good...,positive,restaurant
174354,"Long before visiting this bakery I had heard great things about the their Italian cream cake and a few months later I experienced a slice during a work event, and many months later I was able to visit the bakery. I must first say that the Italian cream cake is amazing with 3 layers and a creamy icing. The location is small but completely filled with all types of desserts and as much as I wanted to try a little of everything, it was just too much. I have such a crazy schedule during the week I love that they stay open late unlike some bakeries. On this trip I was able to try the fudge brownies, pound cake and the amazing oatmeal raisin cookies with walnuts, and everything was really good and there is still so much more to try but I would like to try the red velvet cake on my trip.",positive,restaurant
174373,"YUM , Let me start off by reminding reviewers I'm gluten free soooo the delicious cakes, cookies, bagels , and other assorted pastries here I couldn't indulge in, but my family could and we all agree finger licking desserts . My flourless lemon cake was such a treat, it's so hard finding a good gluten free dessert, especially a moist, flavorful cake , and I was thrilled that my favorite lemon was available. This will definitely be my go to bakery when the need for a treat arises. The cake slices for the red velvet and chocolate cakes were HUGE, more than enough for two people to enjoy together, but if you have a serious sweet tooth I can see you devouring the entire slice because they both were perfectly moist and delicious . The service was friendly, fast, and both attendants were smiling . There wasn't any seating inside and only two tables outside so this appears to be more of a pop in and go shop. I loved the simplicity , made the desserts the main focus. If you're a coffee drinker there was coffee available as well, not sure on taste factor, did seem a bit pricey for regular black drip. I wanted to try the macaroons but I will save that for the next visit ... we will definitely come back . My kids want to try the strawberry turnovers and chocolate chip cookies as well.",positive,restaurant
174441,"I'm glad Villani's seems to be here for the long haul. It's located in a bit of an odd lot with Rico's Acai and a barbershop, but is convenient for Elizabeth and Plaza Midwood folks, especially being that there's plenty of parking and it's one of the only bakeries in the area. Each time I've gone in the staff is incredibly helpful and kind. I usually go to pick up some breakfast sweets, but can never decide on what to get. It's a small place, but they certainly make use of the space provided and pack it with all different kinds of fun or classic cheesecake flavors, biscuits, scones, macarons, semi-sweet italian breads and cookies you can't really find anywhere else close by. You name it, they've probably got it! Not to mention everything they make is GORGEOUS. I couldn't help but to take photos last time I was there and even pulled out my professional camera to add some shots of their treats to my portfolio. My only critiques are that the orangeade is a bit watery and one of the pastries I got once had an amaretto flavor a bit strong for my liking, but the service here is unbeatable and I'm definitely coming back this weekend.",positive,restaurant
174514,"There's just not enough stars to rate these two! From the carrot cake, carbomb cupcakes, to pimento cheese filled croissants....if you have a special occasion, birthday, a holiday gathering, or just want a great treat-- put this one your list! Amanda and Paul are always helpful and such a pleasure to work with. You'll definitely want to go back again and again. And again!",positive,restaurant
174519,"This is the best bakery in Charlotte. We love the Chocolate Croissants, biscotti, Napoleons. Everything we've had is delicious. Not to mention, their coffee is some of the best I've had in the city. So happy to have Villani's in the neighborhood.",positive,restaurant

174547,"My coworker has been raving about Batch Bakehouse for years, but I never take him too seriously because his recommendations are often hit or miss. Well, I finally stopped by 2 months ago and have been a fan ever since! I can tell Batch is well loved by the Madison community because there's been a long line out the door every time I've visited. They have a large assortment of baked goods, but you'll be left with limited pickings if you show up by noon. My personal favorite is the ham and gruyere cheese croissant. The first time I saw it, I was put off by the price and told myself ""this better be the best croissant I've ever tasted"". It was! One of the flakiest croissants I've ever had, filled with delicious warm goodies inside. I'm salivating just writing this. They've also got a delicious pumpkin cookie; it's honestly more like a mini cake but you can reallytaste the pumpkin, and it's one of my partner's favorite things to order. Overall, I love Batch Bakehouse! They're on the pricier side, but they've got some delicious treasures that makeme keep going back!",positive,restaurant
174566,"I'm anxious to try more from Batch. I have a feeling my rating will be 5 stars once I do. Their stuffed brioche rolls are quite good if you're into savory things. They also make the best apple cake in the world, which you can purchase at the Willy Streep Co-op (West, not sure if they have them at the East location). If anything, you must try that. Excited to try more.",positive,restaurant
174574,"Bakery heaven. After hearing so many raving reviews about this place I decided on a Sunday afternoon that I had to make the trek to Willy St. to try it out. And whoa, yeah it's that good. I only tried the Ham and Gruyere Croissant and the Cranberry Walnut Scone with Orange Glaze but holy crap. There was so much filling in that croissant! Probably the biggest and most tasty one I've ever had. The ham was so yummy (saw it was from Jordandal - yay!). The perfect amount of ham and cheese made for a delicious snack. I ate the scone the next morning for breakfast and it was still moist and delicious. I may just have to make this a new weekend routine.",positive,restaurant
174592,"It was my first time visiting Batch Bakehouse. As every business strives to make efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Batch Bakehouse is particularly well organized and feels like they have taken the appropriate safety measures. The staff was patient and friendly and took time to explain the pastry selection and speak to what some of the local favorites were. I ended up getting a chocolate chip croissant. It was incredibly savory with an excellent combination of the buttery, flaky roll with the sweetness of the chocolate chips. I grabbed a cup of iced coffee from a nearby shop. Anyone who knows me would say that I'm a donut fanatic, but I would choose batch Bakehouse pastries over most donuts. One note: Because of quality the prices of the pastries are a bit higher than your average donut shop, but I personally think they make an excellent splurge-worthy treat.",positive,restaurant

174686,"10/5/13 My wife and I stopped at Batch Bakehouse. It's been in business for 4 years. Why oh why was my first visit the day we were moving to Waukesha?!?! They have good coffee, nice bread, and delicious baked sweets. I highly recommend something I think they call the chocolate corkscrew.",positive,restaurant
174715,"GO HERE NOW. I'm sad that I wasn't able to justify getting a baguette, or any of the other bread. It looked delicious--crispy on the outside and perfectly brown. I was able to justify splitting a lemon currant scone with my boyfriend. This was in addition to a ham Gruyere croissant for him and an almond cherry coffeecake for me. The coffeecake was a little sweeter than I hoped for, but that's just because it was the first thing I ate that day. It would have been fantastic for fika or afternoon coffee.",positive,restaurant
174722,"They have a pastry called the crostada and it is delicious. It's like a breakfast casserole in a pie shell and probably very caloric but also very delicious. They have a huge spread of breakfast pastries and are famous for their croissants. They also have coffee. Great place to start your morning, especially in the summer where you can take advantage of their sidewalk tables.",positive,restaurant

174785,"Idiotically went to the Daniels Street location, thinking that it would be nice to fill up before we volunteered at Second Harvest. Turns out... it's the production plant and so they only sell 8 pints or 3 gallons at a time. We walked away with 3 gallons of Oreo mint. Totally worth my significantly lighter wallet. I love the State Street location, and they were just as helpful and patient at the production plant. Oops.",positive,restaurant

They have a bunch I options and mixed in flavors. I love the everything. Just like my bagels, I got a little flavor of it all. Fortunately tey don't over do it and force 100 toppings in one bite. It's fairly consistently one piece per spoon.",positive,restaurant

174996,"I felt a little embarrassed that I was a San Franciscan visiting a Ghirardelli Shop in Las Vegas, but since the sundaes are great, I didn't feel too bad. I had the Mint Bliss and was satisfied with a great minty and chocolatey dessert. The rich fudge sauce they use (the dark chocolate is my favorite) is really what makes their sundaes great. I visited this spot on a very hot (107!) summer day in Las Vegas and it was a perfect way to cool off with ice cream in an air conditioned shop.",positive,restaurant
175021,"Love chocolate? This is a the place to be! The left of the store is the sundae shop where most run $10 but you get $1 for checking in on Yelp or get 10% off if you purchase chocolate first. We didn't have a chance to try one, but they looked delicious and we were told good for sharing. They even have a family sundae for $38! When you walk in, they gave us a free peppermint sample. The right of the shop is the chocolate. You can buy in bulk for just under $10 for half a pound, so pricey. But you can pick and choose what types you want, and so many good ones to choose from. There are also small bags of one kind of chocolates and if you buy 4 bags, you get a deal but still more expensive than buying the mini chocolate bags at Walgreens. I couldn't resist the hot chocolate pouches for 3/$12, I hope it tastes as good as the packaging looks. If you are looking for gifts, there are tins with assorted chocolates. Since we couldn't decide from all the different types, we got the big bag of 80 chocolates (more than 2lbs worth) for $27. There was a deal if you buy 2 bags, you get $5 off. These big bags come in a variety of bags, including mixed and Christmas chocolates. The staff were very helpful to tell us about the differing bags, and various products. The location is the between LINQ and Flamingo heading towards the High Roller. Even if you don't buy anything, come for the free chocolate square if you are in the area!",positive,restaurant
175134,"Came in to wait for my friends who were arriving late for a concert(like always.) I ordered a Sea Salt hot chocolate which was freaking amazing sweet and just right for the cold weather. The staff here was very nice and helping, they offer you a free sample as you walk in and even come by to make sure your ok as you sit inside. Thanks for making a good night even sweeter Ghirardelli.",positive,restaurant
175166,I go here whenever I see one because it's simply the best! The chocolate is perfect. The venue is perfect! I love reading the history about how it got started. The experience I had with my Sunday was as intimate as any of my relationships have ever been. Worth the money but make sure to share!,positive,restaurant
175217,Came back to Milk Bar with a few coworkers & LOVED the soft serve cereal milk along with the milk bar (aka crack) pie slice! I was disappointed with the cake balls & the cookie - simply because they were prepackaged & didn't taste fresh AT ALL! Only go for their fresh baked / crafted goods! Get their pre-made at a grocer back home!,positive,restaurant
175245,mmmmm Yummy in my tummy!! This was a late night snack at like 12 am so we walked down from our hotel room and walked to this place. The cereal milk soft serve is featured here and it tasted like what milk would taste like in your cereal bowl LOL! It was tasty(but a really light taste) and just something to satisfy the cravings. Yea the price is a little high so hopefully there's a price reduction?,positive,restaurant
175256,Excellent! The birthday cake is the best cake ever! Also yummy is the crack pie. It's open till 11am so it's the perfect place to get your dessert after that fancy meal.,positive,restaurant
175265,"I love this place. Christina Tossi is a genius. I have not been here in a while and they have made a few changes. Still the same quality and flavors. The newest one I tried is chi late birthday cake. Yum. Today I asked them if I could have the cup in the 3 flavors. Chocolate birthday cake, crack pie, and cereal milk. Mixed in a few sprinkles and you have a winner. Definitely stop in and try some of their cookies. The compost and the chocolate cornflake marshmallow are the best!",positive,restaurant
175306,"Man alive, that cereal milk soft serve is incredible. Plus, did you know that you can get a swirl of cereal milk and fruity pebbles? It's the perfect combination. I had heard so much about Milk bar, first through momofuku and then learning more about Christina Tosi. The cereal milk was for sure the item I most wanted to try from milk bar, since I had already tried the compost cookie (albeit onboard Jetblue). I wanted to try the crack pie, but since we had not quite had dinner yet, we decided against it. We will probably try it the next time we are in NYC.",positive,restaurant
175382,"A great spot to grab something sweet and unique. The cookies are fantastic, the soft serve is orgasmic. However the thing that I crave on a weekly basis and fills my dreams is the ""Milk Bar Pie"" (Although I discovered it when it was originally called ""Crack Pie"" & so it will hold this title forever and always in my heart.) This pie is addictive, fair warning, once you try it there is no turning back and you will compare all other desserts against it. If you're really in need of a major sugar rush and feeling frisky.... order the pie with a side of the cereal milk soft serve... you are most welcome.",positive,restaurant
175444,"So I went to the Milk Bar after accidentally stumbling upon it on my way to Secret Pizza after the club but Milk Bar was already closed. Thankfully about a year ago I had seen their episode on Netflix that the baker got so I knew I had to make the trek back! I walked 30mins round trip for some pastries TWICE and they didn't disappoint! The team was so accommodating! They allowed me to make edits to my greatest hit box (I can't do ice cream because of my gastric bypass surgery.) The cornflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow was warmed for me by them and it was exquisite! It also came with the B'd cake truffle and it was life changing! The staff also helped answer a ton of my questions in regards to the cakes, sizes, & prices and even got me a frozen cake to far better on the flight home. The staff at Milk Bar LV are extremely kind and welcoming and the food is everything your middle school heart imagined adulthood would taste like. Do yourself a favor and don't go to Sprinkles or any of the other pasty dessert bars. Go to Milk Bar and order EVERYTHING!",positive,restaurant
175629,"So the idea behind this place is that the soft serve is supposed to taste like the milk that is left in your bowl after eating cereal. You can get the cereal milk, fruity cereal milk or red velvet. Fruity cereal milk meaning the taste of milk plus fruity pebbles vs non fruity cereal. Got the cereal milk soft serve topped with fruity pebbles! Very refreshing and tasted just like the last bit of milk and cereal in a bowl after a hearty brekkie",positive,restaurant
175665,"Milk bar isn't for everyone, but it is definitely for me. I love their milk soft serve with the corn flake. It is a bit salty, but I really enjoy it. I can see how some people wouldn't like it though... but I don't really like very sweet desserts, so it's perfect for me! I also really love their corn and cornflake marshmellow chocolate chip cookie. If you love all things corn, get the corn cookie! It's my favorite. The cornflake one is sweeter, but still very good. I love the texture that the cornflakes add to the cookie. I went to Vegas two weeks ago for a bachelorette party and got three cookies. They have a deal 3 cookies for $11. It's regularly $4 a cookie. After finishing my cookies, I asked my boyfriend to get me more cookies since he was going to Vegas the weekend after for the bachelor party. He ended up getting them and I'm soooooo happy! I will definitely stop by if I'm in Vegas again. I wish he could have also brought back the soft serve, but oh well. Can't have everything.",positive,restaurant
175857,An awesome place to go find a sweet treat while in Las Vegas. Everything on the menu looks great. If I would go back again I would get the cookies and/or cake instead of the ice cream products. It seems like there is always a line but it goes pretty quickly and the product is served pretty quickly too. Its a fun place to get a treat in Las Vegas on the strip.,positive,restaurant
176056,"Cereal milk ice cream with cornflakes- yes! It was great! The birthday truffles not really a texture or taste I enjoyed. The compost cookie was out of this world, it has potato chips in it - wow! The crack pie was good, sorry Milk Bar my Mom has a better recipe. All said, we will be back and definitely worth a stop or two!",positive,restaurant
176090,"Cereal milk soft serve topped with cornflakes FOREVA!! So let me preface my review with 'The Before'. I practically rolled myself out of Momofoku looking like Violet Beauregarde after indulging in an unbelievably incredible and massive dinner. I was SO full you guys and that is genuinely an understatement! I overestimated the allotment of stomach space I thought I saved to try Milk Bar's soft serve afterwards - when judgement time arrived I failed myself and my taste buds and sadly commenced my foodie walk of shame... past Milk Bar. *tear* FFW a couple of hours and viola - I found myself back at Milk Bar, feeling like a champ!, around 1am to claim my prize! Mind you, I was still full so I decided to split an order with my friend. As soon as it hit my lips, my god, the heavens spoke to me! That serving, even if just half, was everything in a dessert I never knew I wanted until then. I know it's a bold statement, but I think I experienced nirvana you guys, who knows? I just know that it was me, that cup of soft serve and those cornflakes for a good 10 minutes and nothing. else. mattered. Anyway, we ate at Wicked Spoon for lunch the next day and you best belie' I beelined it back to Milk Bar afterwards and ordered my OWN cereal milk soft serve w/ cornflakes... yuuum! It was just as heavenly as the first time. Bummed their only locations are NYC, DC, Toronto, Las Vegas. Here's to hoping they open one in L.A. sooner rather than later, until then, I'll just be over here daydreaming of that magical encounter.",positive,restaurant
176105,"I saw a review earlier calling out the affrogato here specifically, and I want to second that: in no way should the 5 stars I'm leaving be considered a general recommendation for everything here, as I haven't tried most of the menu, so I can't really comment. But, on recommendation of several previous yelp reviews, I just tried the affrogato, and it was seriously legit. It's a decent amount of soft serve, a decent amount of coffee, and they go *so* well together. The ""cereal milk"" flavor is very unique - it's not particularly sweet, which isn't necessarily a good thing in ice cream eaten by itself, but is just the perfect sweetness to accompany coffee. I especially like it because it's really two desserts in one: it's both perfectly-creamy high quality iced coffee (the coffee is served hot, but after melting a bit of ice cream around it, becomes refreshing iced coffee almost immediately), *and* tasty soft serve that's made better by dunking it in coffee before eating it. Highly recommended, and totally reasonably priced at $5, even if it weren't in the heart of the strip. I did try a couple sips of my my wife's cereal milk milkshake, and it was... fine. I wouldn't go out of my way to get that, and felt like $7.50 was a bit overpriced for it (that said, I personally think a rice-based cereal milk milkshake would likely be much tastier than the corn-based one they make currently. I'd come back to try that if they made one, which, to my knowledge, they don't currently.) I *would* absolutely get the affrogato again for $5, though (in fact, I just might get another one tomorrow, before we leave Las Vegas!) Edit: I did, sort of - I decided I had to try the ""crack pie"" affrogato, too. I told the cashier I was there yesterday and had to try the other one, she said I made a good choice, the crack pie's her favorite. It's good, but personally, I think the cereal milk is a much better affrogato (though the crack pie would probably better by itself - it's like 10 times sweeter.)",positive,restaurant
176133,Cereal Milk soft serve with extra crunch topping is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Everyone who I've turned on to this place has become hooked. The long line and wait time would bey only critique.,positive,restaurant

176226,"I was so happy to read about this being in Las Vegas as well... I always loved the one in New York City and everything is pretty much the same here, except some awesome shakes that are only in Vegas! The famous pie slice and the corn meal cookies are always a must!",positive,restaurant
176311,"Was soo soo excited to try the anticipated Milk Bar with the opening of Momofuku! After dinner at Momofuku we decided to take some Milk Bar treats back to our house for dessert. Ordered two compost cookies, a blueberry & cream cookie, a cornflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow cookie, a crack shake, two MilkBar totes (so cute!) & a full crack pie for my work office. Ate the conrnflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow cookie & compost cookie right away. Both sooo delicious, unique, not too sweet & cooked perfectly. They had a great deal for buying three cookies vs. one and was informed they stay fresh room temp 3-5 days & in the fridge for a whole week. The crack shake was soo sweet but sinfully delicious, and the crack pie was a huge huge hit at my work. I forgot to order the famous cereal milk & crunchy cereal shake! The sweet potato pie soft serve looks so fun! We will be back soon to try more goodies. The cakes looked so good online but none were left (limited availability). Will order one online next event! Would definitely recommend for unique, delicious desserts.",positive,restaurant
176317,"Got the funfetti cookie and the crack pie. The cookie was so amazing. I had it warmed up so it was extra delicious. The crack pie was just ok. Honestly, a little on the small side especially for $6.50 a slice. I tried a small taste of the corn cookie and crack pie soft serve. The corn cookie was the better of the two.",positive,restaurant
176380,"The compost cookie flavor is great (note it has coffee) whether you get the warmed up cookie or ice cream - the difference in texture can help you decide.

I am from California so I never thought I would ever be able to visit. While We were at eggslut, I serendipitously stumbled upon this place and we got the basic order which was the vanilla ice cream with corn flakes (there's an actual name for that but i think it's soft serve) and it was just like eating clouds or air in the best way.",positive,restaurant
176497,I had high hopes for Milk Bar because I have watched and rewatched the Milk Bar/Christina Tosi episode of Chef's Table -- and the cereal milk soft serve and crack pie still totally exceeded my expectations.

Everyone working here seems to have that Christina Tosi brand of joyful energy. Can't wait to come back in the future!,positive,restaurant

176538,"The Milk Bar is an absolute must whenever you're in Vegas I've never seen a place like it my experience was so unique from any other dessert bar that I've been to. All the ladies looked so cute in their bandanas and there was something that just felt so organic about this place like everyone was genuinely happy I got the fruity milkshake and a crack pie, two of the best desserts I've tasted in a very long time I was served very attentively by Katie she did an amazing job her smile was awesome she was very informative of all the recipies and ingredients on the menu i wish i could give this place 6 stars please go and enjoy the sweet treats and even sweeter poeple.",positive,restaurant
176591,"You are a delicious custardy fiesta. I ignored the hype, and went in wary, and came out full of dairy goodness and joy. Jarling's is an unpretentious establishment, basically a small structure with some picnic tables--and a crapload of delicious frozen custard. I went with the pumpkin pie snowstorm, and the regular size was enough for a small meal (think of it as a dinner shake, if slimfast decided to kill you). Tasty time. I'm gonna go again before the snowstorm becomes a real thing and not just an item on the Jarlings menu.",positive,restaurant
176671,"I live closer to Champaign, and have been enjoying the Jarling's Custard Cup there for a few years now. I recently also visited their Danville location. I understand that there is some kind of ""rivalry"" between fans of each of the two locations, kinda like fans of the Cubs and Cardinals. But, I'm sure it's all good fun, because as far as I can tell, both locations have excellent frozen custard deserts. Jarling's is the first place I ran into the idea of ""cold fudge"". It's just like ""hot fudge"", except that it doesn't melt the custard. Brilliant! Several flavors of frozen custard are always available, in just about any conceivable configuration. I've always found the service to be friendly at both locations, and the treat to be just the thing for either a hot summer day or warm summer evening. Bring friends. There's really nothing like sharing an experience like this with friends. That's how I first learned of this place, when friends from work invited me along for a Friday afternoon ""meeting"".",positive,restaurant
176769,"I love this place.... it is five stars. Their cold fudge is the best. Yes, it may not be real custard --- Culver's is closer to custard than Jarlings, but still Jarling's is AMAZING. My only gripe ---- since changing owners..... it was the Friday before Labor Day --- September 4, 2015..... the local pools are celebrating their last weekend of the season. It's 94 degrees out....it's going to be mid 90's all weekend long..... wow, Jarling's would really hit the spot on this super hot sunny weekend..... oh wait.... the parking lot is empty....the barricades are up. Sign in the window says, CLOSED FOR THE SEASON. Hello?!?! It's still summer!!! It's not even Labor Day..... you closed four days ago on August 31st?!?! What the hell?!??!!!!",positive,restaurant
176822,"A unique treat in the CU area. The setting is quaint, the custard wonderfully creamy, and the toppings decadent...a perfect place to go with friends or on a date. I only wish it were closer to campus. I highly recommend the lemon custard.",positive,restaurant
176932,It it amazing !! Best soft serve ice cream in town.My kid love the ice creams. Ube is my favorite flavor It is so creamy and not too sweet. Love this place. Thanks for open in Henderson Las Vegas,positive,restaurant
176933,"This location is just as good as the other, which a much much shorter line. They pretty much have the same flavors and concept. Employees are really nice, flavors are good, and same menu as the other location. Good seating inside and out too. Great for kids and families.",positive,restaurant
176947,It was my first time trying Somisomi and I am in love!! I've been meaning to try for years and Somisomi didn't disappoint. The hype is realll! I got the matcha swirl with custard filling! So goood. Can't wait to try their other flavors. Will be back here very very soon!,positive,restaurant
176962,Awesome place--super Halo Halo. Even came with a color changing spoon! So delightful. Will be coming back often. Thank you guys!!,positive,restaurant
177041,Love this place. Their taro ice cream is amazing! My boyfriend loves their halo halo. Definitely recommend this spot for a sweet treat.,positive,restaurant
177097,"I got halo halo and it was so good! Definitely recommend, tasted exactly like how it does back home. It's also Filipino-owned and the owners are super sweet!",positive,restaurant
177108,"This is such a cute little ice cream shop! They're known for their Halo Halo's, so we had to give it a try! Upon walking in, you're greeted by Ms. Dianne, the owner, who gives you a little background about their shop and what flavors they have coming out soon. I had their special of the day which was Sagu. It was a grass jelly drink with tapioca and white jelly. My friends got their Halo Halo, which was 5$ for a giant cup! Everything tasted wonderfully-- not too sweet, not too bland. This shop was absolutely the cutest! It was bright, clean and very well maintained. Their ice creams all have cute little names such as unicorn poop, abuelita, play dough and more! My friends and I will definitely be back to try all of their other items on the menu!",positive,restaurant
177170,"LOVE THIS PLACE !! The staff is always so friendly and helpful! They have unique flavors and ideas for making some pretty cool dessert creations. There are some cute walls to take photos in front of, plus a patio area in the back. Windsor and Churn connect to each other so they share a back patio. The patio isn't super large though and can fill up, especially around the time after dinner ! I always come here and can't wait to return :)",positive,restaurant
177199,"We had a great time visiting this place and enjoying the fresh ice cream and cookies. There's cute little seating area outside. Perfect place to sit and enjoy when there's beautiful weather outside. My kids enjoyed looking at all the decor and goodies they had on display as well as the ice cream they chose. They switch out cookie options, so not all of the types of cookies are available every time, but the ones we tried were delicious.",positive,restaurant
177229,"10/10 would recommend! The staff was very nice and the ice cream choices are endless! So many different flavors, and signature flavors! Will be coming back again!",positive,restaurant
177257,The ice cream is good but there is no real seating unless you're a car . I wouldn't go again,positive,restaurant
177285,Churn is definitely my go-to dessert stop in Uptown. I love their peanut butter ice cream! They have amazing sundaes and shakes too!,positive,restaurant
177318,"Cute shop, I loved their candy options that you can buy. Some of the flavors on their menu were unique, I've never seen a Vietnamese coffee ice cream flavor before. I ordered the lemon sorbet and it was very refreshing. There's a cute outdoor patio in the back that has plenty of shade.",positive,restaurant
177321,"Ok, how adorable is this place? Parking is limited up front but there is a parking lot on the side with plenty of room. Walking in is like hopping back in time. It is a really cute little ice cream parlor. They have a bunch of fun nostalgic candy for sale too. My mom and I shared one of their seasonal freezes and it was so good. I am really glad we split it, they were nice enough to put it into two cups for us too. It was really good but also really sweet and I definitely would not have been able to finish one myself.",positive,restaurant
177335,"My absolute go-to for ice cream and sundaes when I'm in the area! My personal preference is the ""Fat Elvis"" which I recommend ordering with one scoop of chocolate and one scoop of peanut butter ice cream. If you're not into sundaes, don't worry! Churn also rotates out some flavors seasonally, and there's always the staples (chocolate, vanilla, peanut butter, etc.) and you can always get a cone with toppings. One thing to note is that there is very little indoor seating (maybe one table), but there are tables out back, and there's usually at least a small line unless you come at an odd time. Worth it though!",positive,restaurant
177361,"Upward projects did it again!! The ice cream is creamy and rich, and they offer mostly classic flavors with a few unique options. What sets this ice cream shop apart from the others is all of the ways you can eat ice cream... so many combinations for floats, shakes, freezies and more! I had the Carmel apple pie float with a scoop of vanilla and a scoop of pumpkin ... absolutely fabulous fall treat! The staff are friendly, helpful and patien! The shop is also incredibly clean. Highly recommend you stop by after dinner or just because in the afternoon!",positive,restaurant
177435,"There is something so pure about Churn. I love this place, so do many other people because almost every time I come there's a line out the door. I originally found Churn on Yelp and decided to make the drive from East Arcadia based on the reviews. I'm glad I did because this is now my go to spot for good ice cream. I do really enjoy all the little tchotchkes they have that take me back to my childhood, I usually pick up a couple of them along with my ice cream. Come to Churn!",positive,restaurant
177436,"Churn is my all time favorite ice cream place. I have been coming here for about 2 years now, and recommend it to all visiting the area! Each flavor is rich, creamy, and accompanied by a mountain of toppings (my favorite part). Not only can you expect quality ice cream, but the workers go above and beyond to ensure a positive experience. The line does have a tendency to be long, but I promise, the treat is well worth the wait. Like I said, the workers are working as hard and as fast as they can, it's just a valley hot spot! You'll see why when you go. If it's your first time going, get the ""Fat Elvis"" or ""S'mores"" sundae... Trust me! Churn AZ put a modern flair on the classic, old-fashioned ice cream parlor- and they absolutely nailed it!",positive,restaurant
177450,"OH MY GLOB! I went here for my first time on a Saturday night and there was a long line to get in and order! Hm, must mean this place is good. At least I hope so! I ordered a s'mores sundae (chocolate ice cream, hot fudge, butter graham's, and toasted marshmallow fluff) but I switched out the chocolate ice cream for Madagascar vanilla. It was AMAZING! And huge! They give you so much! I'm glad I traded out for vanilla ice cream because the chocolate would make it even more sweet and rich. My dad ordered a strawberry shortcake sundae but I didn't try it. I love Churn and would definitely love to return!",positive,restaurant
177454,Definitely one of the best place to enjoy some mouth/watering boutique ice-creams! Love the music ! Hip & trendy! Nice patio (front and back) with mister-water system & chic outdoor decors. Open late on week nights...for summer in Phoenix. Great spot to hang out after the other 90% of ice-cream places close after 9 pm. Let's ice-cream after hour!,positive,restaurant
177616,"I don't eat sweets very often, but when I do, Churn hits the bill!! I love the chocolate cherry crunch with a side of their upbeat, friendly service! Our most recent visit was at 10:50 pm, just before closing time. We sat outside to enjoy our sweet treats, and then realized we needed water and some extra napkins. With it being past closing at that point, we had to knock on the door to let us back in. They rushed over to unlock the door, were super friendly about us needing a bit more service, and we left just a few moments later with everything we needed. Great service!",positive,restaurant
177618,"If you like PB & chocolate ice cream w/ salted caramel, nuts all in one place try the ""kitchen sink"" omg ! Great atmosphere on the shady back patio !",positive,restaurant
177667,"It was fantasic, I'll come back here with my wife for sure. The cookie was amazing! But keep in mind it's huge. My wife and I split the cookie and they even put the sandwich in different cups. Super helpful",positive,restaurant
177681,"Being in walking distance from Churn is a dangerous thing. Between my boyfriend and I, we go through 4-5 punchcards a month. My ice cream usually doesn't survive the walk home...because I practically inhale it. We might have a problem. But the ice cream is so good! My favorites are the butter pecan, coffee, and plain old vanilla (with the addition of peanut butter cups). There is also always a few rotating flavors, so make sure you get them when you can because they tend to go away quickly. If you're not an ice cream person, there are also baked goods, candies, and fun little toys to bring you back to childhood (slap bracelets anyone?) I have to agree with others though...the parking situation is awful. Even if you find a spot, you usually end up getting stuck at the valet station while they are helping other people. You might be better off parking in the neighborhood and walking. Your thighs and sanity will thank you.",positive,restaurant
177696,"This place has delicious ice cream!! Have been here twice, once around lunch/early dinner time and the second late in the evening after dinner about 9pm'ish? Not very busy early in the evening, long lines at night on the weekend, but worth it! LOVE LOVE LOVE the mint & the Vietnamese coffee!! Also the first time i went there they had a Stout flavor.. but sadly was not there the second time I went! Price is fair and their selection of cones is good as well! Will be back again to try other flavors and milkshakes, etc!",positive,restaurant
177716,"Dear Churn, I love you. Peanut butter ice cream. Seriously? You had me at pretzel cone but peanut butter ice cream? How can a girl say no to that? Super cute shop, friendly staff, and a speedy service line makes getting your ice cream craving cured pain free and fun. Love all the knick knacks although the toys right at kid level were pretty devious of you. But...peanut butter ice cream. Yeah. That makes it all better.",positive,restaurant
177730,"I'd have no problem driving across town for one of their 'freezies'. Interested in knowing how I maintain my status as the ""most favored uncle""? Frequent visits with the kiddos to this place that's how.",positive,restaurant
177736,"The sweetest, most charming, little indulgent shop I know. If you're in downtown Phoenix and are craving something sweet, then you must, and I mean must, head on over to Churn. It's located on Central ave right next to Windsor (another must try btw). It features freshly made churned ice cream with simple ingredients and no added preservatives or stabilizers! This is the real, good, old school way to eat ice cream ya'll. They offer so many fun flavors and with their choices of sundaes, ice cream cookie sandwiches, milkshakes, and floats, the possibilities are endless. If ice cream isn't your thing, or you just want something sweet, their selection of candies are sure to satisfy and take you back a few years into your childhood. They also make fresh baked goods, have delicious coffee, and sell fun throwback toys like army men and yo yo's! Churn brought an instant smile to my face the moment I walked in. I couldn't help but want to try it all and the service was incredible too. What a great place to spend a beautiful spring day in Phoenix. Definitely check it out and bring the whole family for a treat they'll never forget.",positive,restaurant
177751,"There's nothing like good old fashioned ice cream! Churn has it DOWN! They had me at ""toasted marshmallow topping."" Be still my heart. I ordered a scoop of PB ice cream with salted caramel & the marshmallow topping. So rich & delicious. They actually torch the homemade marshmallow right there! Awesome! You can tell their ice cream & toppings are made from quality ingredients. The only downfall is parking, it SUCKS! I will stick to coming here at random times & def not during lunch or dinner when the Windsor is packed.",positive,restaurant
177821,"They have yummy ice cream, with tons of flavors to choose from. Decorations are hip, with a childish motif. Nice place to sit outside, enjoy your yummy ice cream.",positive,restaurant
177822,"At 930 pm we had a 20 min wait to get in our order, so we were really curious as to finding out what was so special about these ice creams. Don't plan your order beforehand as they do not have all the flavors from their menu. So I ended up taking the toasted coconut ice cream with toasted marshmallow fluff and Reese's. It was delicious. The toasted coconut ice cream was very coconutty and I could taste the shredded coconut through the ice cream. The ambience and outdoor seating reminds me of a college hangout area. It's a simple social setting. Overall a great place minus one because toasted coconut wasn't my first preference and the place did not have all the flavors mentioned in the menu! But a place everyone should visit at least once.",positive,restaurant
177827,"Very tasty ice cream, hip decor and nice staff! I will skip the brewed coffee next time I am there though... lol",positive,restaurant
177855,Went to Churn for the first time with my baby for her birthday and we were so glad we went!! The employees were super friendly and helpful especially after we told them it was our first time there. We each ordered an ice cream sandwich with two different cookies and two types of ice cream! The cookies were AWESOME and huge! The ice cream was so yummy and you get two big scoops for the middle of the sandwich!,positive,restaurant
177902,"It's dangerous that I live so close to this place! I can walk there. Which I should, since it's ice cream and I need to work some of it off. Get the peanut butter with a scoop of chocolate. They have candy, too. I came home with stuff I haven't had since I was a kid. (it's no Smeeks, but they have about a dozen different candies to choose from.) Don't think it's on par with Sweet Republic, but it is good, especially with Mary Coyle's closing. The outside seating is nice and the misters work *really* well.",positive,restaurant
177937,"We live in the neighborhood right behind Churn and walk here often. My absolute FAVORITE is a scoop of Coconut ice cream with toffee syrup (made in house). My kids always ask to take a walk to get ice cream. The shop has an old ice cream shop feel and the staff are always friendly and cheerful. There may be a long line, but believe me, its WORTH IT!",positive,restaurant
177964,DELISH! This place is great! Atmosphere - 10 Ice Cream - 9 Price - 4 My husband and I split a peanut butter/chocolate lover dream sundae there and it was so so good! The place is setup as a old fashion soda fountain/candy/ice cream shop and it is done up perfectly. My only complaint is that it is bit pricey for what you get - so it is a bit of a splurge.,positive,restaurant
178044,"Was at a conference in Phoenix and chose this ice cream place because of other Yelp reviews. It was definitely a great choice. Incredible ice cream and toppings, mostly made right there on site. Also, the staff were some of the friendliest people we met in the entire city! Will definitely be back on my next trip!",positive,restaurant
178051,"This is my first review, one which after visiting Churn, I felt very compelled to write! I chose this place randomly, as it was equidistant between myself and a friend I was meeting up with. It had 4 stars on Yelp, and I myself holding Yelp to a very high regard, I thought I could trust it. And I'm so very glad that I did! Churn was charming, delicious, and an overall delightful experience. The staff was enthusiastic and incredibly helpful, and while they didn't have lots and lots of options, there were many choices as far as alterations on what they did provide. It was very reasonably priced, and the portions were huge. I chose to make a custom cookie sandwich with their mint cookie ice cream and chocolate chip cookies. I would recommend this particular flavor any time, and can't wait to get back to try the rest of what they have!",positive,restaurant
178070,"After you finish a tasty meal at Windsor, you absolutely have to treat yourself to some ice cream at Churn. My fave is chocolate fudge with pecans and caramel! Score!",positive,restaurant
178080,Great peanut butter cookie and I am not even a peanut butter fan! Also loved the strawberry and butter pecan ice creams.,positive,restaurant
178081,"While the ice cream is very good, I found the flavors to be uninspiring. Churn is good if your'e a classic-flavors kind of person, but I like to try new things and they didn't offer many beyond the traditional.",positive,restaurant
178102,Amazing and friendly service! Great desert place and tegu finally have parking near by.,positive,restaurant
178119,"There's a certain amazingness that comes from fresh made ice cream. It's soft, creamy, and not filled with high fructose corn syrup and preservatives to keep it together for months in a freezer. Growing up in Arizona, we always made homemade ice cream in the summer and if you've never experienced homemade ice cream, just go to Churn. I had the banana ice cream with caramel sauce on top. I can't say anything bad about it at all. If someone doesn't like their ice cream, it's because they've been subject to all the fakeness added to ice cream in the stores and national ice cream shop chains. The shop has lots of toys and candy and knickknacks that will give you a sense of nostalgia. I'll tell you what sounds like the best day ever: riding my bike down Central on a beautiful Phoenix day... stopping in to Churn for an ice cream break (and then popping into one of the restaurants nearby for a cocktail).",positive,restaurant
178192,Get yourself some yummy icecream and plunk it down outside on the patio! Really nice space out there. Thumbs up!!,positive,restaurant
178205,A little over hyped but indulgent nonetheless. The grilled cheese was sinfully delicious and the other goodies were definitely full of sugar. Everything you'd expect from a donut shop. The kid freebies were a nice Elmo-y touch which I appreciate since the tab can get up there. Enjoyed the visit and worth a stop if your driving by.,positive,restaurant
178209,"I liked this place but I think it comes down to what you were raised on. I think Krispy Kreme is trash because I grew up on Shipleys. Shipleys has the best yeast donut to Me. This place the yeast is gigantic and a lil heavier but there glazes are really good hear. They are at a premium price but I will say the donuts are large. Lots of cool flavors to try, I wish the Pop tart one had actual pop tart filling but that's asking a lot. A lovely young lady in line with me suggested the French toast joint so consider it if you come. Nice way to stretch your legs in the morning if your staying on Fremont and wake your crew up with donuts.",positive,restaurant
178212,"Warning! If you are a tourist and it's June 2022, you're going to have a tough time navigating in this area. There is a lot of construction that starts at the freeway and continues down into the neighborhood where this place is. It's in the downtown area. I'm sure they have great donuts but we couldn't find a way to get there. Literally, every route our very good routing system told us to take, we ran into another ""construction obstruction."" If you want to go, I'd call them for directions.",positive,restaurant
178231,"Donut Bar is one of the best places for breakfast. It has to be breakfast. They're only open until the donuts sell out. Most days they're out of them early. They also have coffee and vegan versions. It doesn't have official hours. It usually opens about 8 in the morning. They're only open until they sell out, which depending on how busy they are can be soon after they open. It's not a big place, and there's usually a line waiting out the door. The best thing you can do is get there soon after they open. I like the apple fritter. It's about $2 each. This is massive. It's crispy and not excessively sweet, and it goes good with coffee. This donut is also vegan. It usually has several vegan options. They also have donuts with Oreos and Twix bars in them. It doesn't have that much room inside. It only has a few seats against the wall where you can use an outlet. There is a courtyard that's shared by Juice Stars.",positive,restaurant
178239,Part of me weekend. Love going and seeing what creation is there. Donuts are huge and tasty,positive,restaurant
178258,"High marks for the Donut Bar. Cool little donut shop away from the Fremont Street nonsense. Besides the wide variety of donuts, there are plenty of coffee options, a water station, and an outdoor seating area. Shop was clean, staff was friendly, and we got an incredible deal on a box of donuts as it was near closing time. Really enjoyed the smallish creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut. Pop tart donut was gimmicky, but had to try anyway. Fun place.",positive,restaurant
178263,"Donut Bar is your typical hip donut spot located in Downtown Las Vegas. They have mainly fancy donuts, not the og stuff. Street parking. Open until they sell out. Inside has limited seating. Prices are decent for the style of donuts they have. Came in at 11:30 am on a Saturday and they had happy hour, fill a box with anything for $10. Literally 10 donuts for 10 bucks. Normally 10 donuts here would be close to $40-50. Won't review each donut, All the donuts I got tasted like how they should. The dough was good and chewy. Sweet but nothing to bad where it hurts the teeth. Big Poppa Tart - $5 - Huge jelly filled donut shaped like a pop tart. Salted Caramel - $3 - Huge! Vanilla - $3 - Huge! Birthday Cake - $2 - Sprinkles! Boston Cream - $3 Peanut Butter & Jelly - $3 - My favorite! Creme Brulee - $3 Raspberry Cheesecake - $2 Nutella Overload - $4 Cinnamon Roll - $4 Sugar high!!!",positive,restaurant
178276,"A perfect place to stop in for an indulgent breakfast before we depart Las Vegas. We arrived at 9:30 on Sunday and they had plenty of selection. I am always fearful they will have sold out of the good stuff but we had lots of choice. And no line-ups when we were there. I ordered the French Toast Donut which is served warm and comes with small sides of whipped butter, jam (possibly raspberry?), and syrup. It was lovely and served me as a full breakfast meal. It had that lovely brioche taste that I enjoy in their donuts. My husband had the Brad's Fritter which is a bacon and apple fritter. Again, a full breakfast serving with no skimping on the salty, crunchy bacon chunks on top. Got a latte and Americano to go and we left to walk it off.",positive,restaurant
178277,Great donuts and cute atmosphere. Frequently service and such a selection. Go check it out.,positive,restaurant
178294,A must everytime I visit Vegas. Great service and donuts. We always end up buying extra to bring back home.,positive,restaurant
178338,"I wish I would have taken a picture of our delicious donuts! They were exquisite! They don't put ""#bestdonutsever"" on the box for nothing. Our family had a coffee, cream filled donut, old fashioned, and a maple bar donut. Everything was great!! I highly recommend this adorable donut shop.",positive,restaurant
178363,"I actually came here when they first opened and several times since. It lives up to the hype of that video and the creme brÃ»lÃ©e donuts. Damn that crackle on that creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut and French toast donut. Also don't just come for this donut, all their other donuts are beautiful, unique, and bloody delicious. Come hungry for donuts. Not a lot of places to sit and the outside patio is nice when it's not 100 degrees. I would also make sure or know your order and get your box of donuts all in one go to forgo the long lines. Parking is also freaking terrible and make sure to pay attention to the signs",positive,restaurant
178389,"Last morning before class, so I stopped in. I saw the Strawberry Split and had second thoughts! That's too big for this morning. If it ain't Krispy Kreme, let me get a cake donut! I ordered the Apple Crumb & Old Fashioned w/ Vanilla Bean glaze. The Apple crumb was delicious. I expected a heavily sweet taste, but it didn't have that. The old fashioned was a tad bit crisp, but it was good. Not a bad Yelp suggestion!",positive,restaurant
178439,"Donuts galore, people! Donuts galore! I have a major weakness for 3 things: fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies, chocolate fudge cake, and donuts. These donuts are not for the faint of heart! They are 3x the size of a normal donut packing in lots of sweetness and an explosion of flavor! They sold me on the sugar donut topped with homemade whipped cream and strawberries (which I split, rather reluctantly!) while my friend also took a vanilla donut to go. Their donuts are fresh and soft and perfect for the start of a Monday.",positive,restaurant
178492,Awesome fun place !! Music was playing the the staff was friendly!! Donuts were sooo yummy and full of flavor and the size was huge !!,positive,restaurant
178524,Most amazing shop in town for great donuts and stellar coffee - I go there weekly with my kid in Saturday's and he loves it talks about it all week. He's addicted and I'm addicted to his happiness there. Amazing confections on top of amazing fluffy donuts. Get there. Get some before they sell out daily. Sell out is by noon on weekends 2pm other days. 5 star superior choice.,positive,restaurant
178568,"Had a work trip to Vegas, but had to figure out my own accommodations off-strip for one night. I mostly buckled down and did work, but after getting up early the next morning, I checked out Yelp to find out this place was right down the street. My cold brew was stellar but my whipped cream strawberry donut extravaganza was the real star. Started to walk out the door. Went back for some cream brulee bites. Was not disappointed. I was in and out in a minute and had a delicious breakfast, so I had no complaints!",positive,restaurant
178579,"Good donuts, damn good donuts. What else is there to know? Ah... if you insist... So I guess this place is famous. I didn't know, I just came downtown to pay a ticket and saw a neat little sign for a donut shop. Inside I go and I'm just blown away by the different types of donuts on display! Homer's donut? Matcha donut? Nutella donut? What!? Which should I try? The answer is ALL OF THEM! Haha okay not really, but I did buy a dozen. The french toast donut was my favorite. I believe they make it on request because mine came out hot, and I did have to wait additional time for it. It comes with syrup on the side as well. My only regret is not buying two! It was that good. I loved Homer's donut as well. I believe that was strawberry flavored icing on top? It was simple, but great. The strawberry split was SO good! My partner loved how it wasn't too sweet, and loved having creme and strawberries in the donut. I didn't order the creme brulee donut this time, but I hear it's their signature donut. Heck, they all look and taste like signature donuts! Instead of cooking breakfast I think I'll just order a french toast donut from here instead. It was bigger than all the donuts and very filling. They close when they're out of donuts and trust me, they will run out. I recommend arriving early as there's usually no line. Definitely a must try when you're in Las Vegas! PROTIP: Their menu changes DAILY! You can also order in advance on their website only during THE DAY BEFORE! And it has to be a dozen donuts, minimum. I believe the deadline is 6pm, but I could be mistaken. This saves a lot of time during busy weeks if there's a festival going on in the city.",positive,restaurant
178620,Simply the best and it is not even close!!! If you are in Vegas this is a must stop. The earlier you can get there the better. The selection varies from day-to-day. They use all fresh ingredients and the doughnuts are huge!! They have a nice patio in the back with plenty of shade. Trust me you need Doughnut Bar in your life. It is on the to do list anytime I am in Las Vegas. Heads up they will sell out sometimes go early for best results,positive,restaurant
178629,So this place is within walking distance from my hotel and man it was delicious and the donuts all look so pretty. I got myself a Boston cream and an expresso. My 5 year old got the chocolate donut. We enjoyed it so much we decided to stop by again the next day after lunch and it was closed cause they were sold out. My son was literally in tears. He really wanted to have a donut again. I was taking a picture of the sold out sign when he looked up at the right time I got the cutest sad face from being donutless. I recommend to go there before 12 noon. I highly recommend this place.,positive,restaurant
178632,Hhtgh Gia}/11aqqqq-- The donut bar .. These are the BEST donuts in the entire world .,positive,restaurant
178638,Wow! Fantastic! I got the strawberry shortcake donut and Jim got the vanilla bean donut. Then we shared a creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut. By far the creme brÃ»lÃ©e was the best one! The cream center is made in house and the crunchy sugar top makes this donut turkey something special! The vanilla bean was good so was the strawberry shortcake. They are huge but nothing to special. Atmosphere is great and the staff are wonderful!,positive,restaurant
178649,Love this downtown hot spot! My kids like getting these as a treat and we've had them at parties and work gathering. Staff is always super nice and friendly. Easy location to walk to from Fremont st and container park. Close to life is beautiful and year round street art.,positive,restaurant
178671,"National Donut Day! Free Birthday Cake donut. I love the price on these awesome donuts. Crime BrÃ»lÃ©e never disappoints. Make sure to stop by here before the free donuts are all gone! All employees wore masks and gloves. Was greeted warmly and received decent and timely service this morning. Thank you all at Donut Bar LV, see you again soon!",positive,restaurant
178696,"So after the amazing opportunity to eat these donuts at an elite event, I wanted to come by and see the selection in person. Early on a weekday, I stopped off and picked up 6 donuts for the secretary and I to share. This donut shop is gourmet and heightened flavors. When I brought home the extra donuts for the hubby and kids, they generally ignored them. I was disappointed, but the hubby said that the flavors were outside of the kids wheelhouse. I know that the place has kid friendly options on the weekend and the chocolate milk on draft will draw my little one in. So, maybe, I need to bring them in and let them pick their own flavor options. Here's what we tried. The dipped old fashion was eh. The Pop Tart was amaze-balls. Coworker and I took turns with the plastic knife as we cut off sections. The jelly inside is tasty. The frosting is perfect and not too much. The bacon on top of the Brad fritter should just be served by itself. I wanted to eat it all. Coworker told me to, as she like the fritter, but the bacon was a bit off putting for her. She had the blueberry cheesecake; didn't share. Split the creme brulee. The cracked sugar top is interesting. The star of the show, in my opinion, is the creme filling. Looking for a weekend to go back. I hear the trick is to get there early, as they sell out of flavors.",positive,restaurant
178703,The whipped creme donut with strawberries is VEGAN! They have a lot of vegan options and they're all amazing! The coffee is delicious too. The pricing is fair due to the quality of the donuts. My complaint: The donuts are first come first serve and they seem to run out pretty quickly. I wish they would stay open longer and make more donuts.,positive,restaurant
178716,"I used yelp to place an order the night before, and the experience was great! I walked in, skipped the line, picked up my order, and walked out in less than 30 seconds. This place makes an exceptional apple fritter, and the creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut is a little piece of heaven with crystalized sugar on top. We come here on every visit to Las Vegas.",positive,restaurant
178806,"Other than the fact that is on the strip this donut shop is fantastic. Sugar junkie hit spot for sure. The grand kids love this place. Good coffee and Tea here also breakfast, but my for my family it is all about the donuts. Great variety and great tasting donuts! Sugary goodness! Worth a try if youve not been down.",positive,restaurant
178825,"Place is amazing. Let me say that donuts are my weakness!!!! So many people would be surprised to pay 3-6 bucks for a donut, but I honestly say... worth it! I had the French toast donut! Amazing. Served with butter and syrup, also with a side of blue berry jelly. I destroyed it. I've also tried the pop tart donut, the birthday cake, Creame BrÃ»lÃ©e, samoa, oreo, and red velvet. All ok. I would say try the pop tart one, but it's share it. It's super rich and filling.",positive,restaurant
178847,"Been to this place many times, while you're in downtown LV in the morning, check this place out! Nice staff, good prices for donuts and coffee, and there's vegan options. The menu rotates everyday so you can have different options. I hope to try their other donuts on their menu, my favorite is the birthday cake oreo, blueberry meyer, and raspberry.",positive,restaurant
178875,"This. Place. Is. Amazing. I have been to the Donut Bar in SD, and I think I like this one more! Chocolate and strawberry milk on tap... But beware, it can be loud. The staff here are all very helpful! It is a quick-service type place, with lines usually out the door (although TOTALLY worth the wait!). My recommendations are; blood orange, Creme brÃ»lÃ©e, birthday cake, caramelized pineapple, and Oreo. I haven't tried the French toast yet (but fully intend to), and I hear they now have Blue Moon as well, which is also on my donut list. Word of warning: Get there early! Because once they sell out, they close up. No matter the time!",positive,restaurant
178922,"What a great place! I have to visit a local donut joint in every city I visit; so glad I picked this one! The young lady that helped me was super cute (I love a girl who can rock blue hair) & friendly. I was bummed they were out of the salted caramel until I saw the size of their fritters! I got the one with bacon- check out the pic. And I finally got a creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut! So happy I did. Both were excellent. A bonus: the ""artwork"" in the bathroom!",positive,restaurant
178968,"You can definitely taste the QUALITY within these donuts. They are more than just good...they bring magic and sparkle to your life. The selection they have is just amazing. Yesterday was my 1st visit to the location. I tried the following donuts: blueberry cheesecake, Homer's donut, and Boston creme. Let me tell you...this place will over exceed your expectations! I WILL BE BACK...very soon!",positive,restaurant
178976,"If you're thinking of getting donuts at Krispy Kreme, don't bother, it will never be able to compete with the donuts here at donut bar. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e is a hit that's for sure, but the Oreo birthday cake, maple bacon, and red velvet donuts are also bangin. Get there before 10am and you'll have more options as they do sell out as the day rolls by.",positive,restaurant
179005,Just came here again. Love this place. The owner and his staff are awesome!! Love the creme brÃ»lÃ©e. I wish I could try all the different donuts. They are all amazing!,positive,restaurant
179008,"Today was the first time my family and I have been to this great place. And we loved it!!! The kids for the free donuts which were Inside Out themed, I had the Butter Beer donut, and my other half had the French Toast Donut (made to order). To drink we had 2 small drips (self service), and the kids had strawberry milk. The staff was super helpful and friendly, Chef Jeff gave the kiddos balloons and interacted with them. We will definitely be coming back!!",positive,restaurant
179057,"A nice, small, quiet place not far from the craziness of Fremont Street. I like they way they do business: open at 7 am (8 on the weekends) and close when they sell out--which seems to happen before noon. That way the doughnuts are assuredly fresh. The service was genuinely friendly. The doughnuts were very good, but nothing too exciting.",positive,restaurant
179074,"Great service, beautiful donuts! Yummy, fun donuts! This menu is long and creative! Cake batter donut, Homer Simpson donut....",positive,restaurant
179101,"From a donut standpoint, Donut Bar is simply dope. They were one of my favorites while in San Diego, so for me, the fact that they took over where O-face used to be is a straight up upgrade. Every donut they do is gourmet and you can tell they make them with care and keep them at top quality. They are also very community oriented and are always doing things hat put them out there so that people can put a face to the names. They were absolute life savers at Life Is Beautiful. They are also super cool because they post their menu for the next day on all their social media, so you know if your favorite donut is gonna be there and you don't have to guess. My only gripe is that they open relatively late for a donut place at 7am and it's super cool that they are open until sold out. This works out well for me since I work downtown so it's easy for me to get to but if you're not as lucky as me then you better make sure to get in as early as possible. Also, another super cool thing I'll say is that you should heck out their bathroom. It lets you know exactly how dope these people are. Long story short, find a way down here. Eat some donuts. Walk out like a boss",positive,restaurant
179149,"Now I may have showed up at 11, so they had painted outside that they were sold out but when I came in to double check he did have some they didn't sell yet. Wasn't a huge variety because it was the leftovers some chocolate bars, coffee bar, and some massive sugar donuts. They were absolutely delicious! I got a good deal and more than I could eat for a great price. I got to make it on time tommorow .",positive,restaurant
179151,"Amazing giant donuts, excellent value and many interesting flavors to choose from. Friendly service. The nitro cold brew coffee was spot on. Highly recommend this place",positive,restaurant
179208,"I don't come to Vegas without stopping here first! After eating here I never eat donuts anywhere else. Great service, charming location (their back patio is lovely), and THE DONUTS ARE SIMPLY AMAZING! They live up to the hype! Creme brÃ»lÃ©e and peanut butter cup are probably my two favorites but any donut they have is soooo worth the calories! Also, if they still have donuts left later in the day sometimes you can get a box for $10 but those are rare occasions!",positive,restaurant
179232,Love love love this place. The Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e had a hard sugar top just like the real stuff. The Mud pie was the perfect amount of Peanut butter. Not supper sweet and well balanced. We got a box full for $10.00 around 1pm.,positive,restaurant
179280,"Donuts bring families together! This place is heaven. My family and I had just finished a 4 day vegas trip, and to say we were all sick of each other was an under statement. As we were leaving los vegas i decided to take my family here unannounced. They were not thrilled, donuts? Is what I heard from them.we had not had breakfast yet but we were in downtown and I decided to treat my self. Pleasing my family is never easy, but the Donut bar delivered. My sister is a vegan and a food snob, (guess what they make amazing vegan donuts, so amazing they don't even want to tell you so that you don't try them!) My parents are very set in their ways and we're not thrilled by donuts for breakfast......it's so good once it hits your lips!!!!!!!! My family were taken back by the creme Brule donuts, than the strawberry cream, and the lemon pistachio. But when I got the maple bacon donut (I've had dreams about this thing ) they looked at me like I was crazy. It was amazing! I had to force them to try it but they ended up loving it. Thank Donut Bar because of your donuts our family tension was gone we were able to bond and have a good drive home. Your donuts saved the day!",positive,restaurant
179286,"It must be a dream...don't wake me because I never want to leave! This place is a little slice of heaven is all I can say. My girlfriend and I were in Vegas visiting her family and I thought I'd try my luck at a local donut shop. I really enjoy cake donuts and specialty donuts, so let's see what Vegas has to offer. I came across the Donut Bar. The shop is pretty small but the donuts are enormous! I walked in and thought I died and went to heaven...this place is amazing! I was created by friendly and helpful staff to assist me with my order. Sooooo many choices and they all look delicious. I got a dozen because I didn't want to miss out on anything! I also shared with my girlfriend's family...to help educate them on the finer things in life! The apple fritter with bacon, I think it's called ""the Brad"" but it is fantastic! Apple and bacon together is a match made in heaven. I also tried the ""big daddy"" which was a donut with an entire s'more inside (there are other flavors)..genius! The pumpkin spice was also good. My girlfriend's mom had the creme brÃ»lÃ©e...she loved it. My girlfriend had the birthday cake Oreo donut and wouldn't share so I'll take that as she liked it. You can't go wrong here. I highly advise anyone to go here if you're in Vegas...these donuts are life changing! If I could give them 6 stars I would.",positive,restaurant
179302,"This is now one of my favorite donut shops. When I came in, I was excited to see a lot of fun options ranging from pistachio to strawberry cheese cake to the classic and delicious maple bacon. Most of the donuts were huge and still very well priced ($2-$4)! On top of it all, the staff was sooo friendly and that made my experience even better!",positive,restaurant
179358,"Hands down the best donut I've ever had!! The PB&J was INSANE! The staff is so nice and friendly, such a fun environment. Tried it while I was in town from Utah and this will now be a stop every time I'm in town.",positive,restaurant
179377,"HUGE donuts. Picked up a big poppa tart doughnut filled with a strawberry pop tart and jelly filling. It was big enough to split in half and share with another person. Also tried the creme brulee donut which was delicious, and got a free birthday cake doughnut because it was chef Jeff's birthday which was pretty good. Tried the cold brew which tasted just as good as Starbucks. I also enjoyed a chocolate milk from the tap, it was good but nothing too special as far as chocolate milk goes. I will cone back to try some more doughnuts from their long menu.",positive,restaurant
179395,My absolute favorite coffee donut spot in the valley. Always fresh and delicious. Fabulous variety.,positive,restaurant
179413,"Insanely yummy! Was able to sample three donuts (chocolate, maple and 'vanilla' with white icing) that appeared to merely-be oversized items that any supermarket store sells. The comparison ends there. Amazing!! Seriously... who uses real vanilla bean in their donut glazes anymore? These guys do! Whose donuts are like eating soft billow slices of cake? These are! More please!",positive,restaurant
179425,"Shop faces Carson not 6th. We walked from Fremont took a few extra steps, but well worth it.",positive,restaurant
179444,this is probably my favorite donut place ever. absolutely delicious. will definitely return. only wish is that there was one closer to home ;-)),positive,restaurant
179465,"I am not even all that much of a donut person, but this place is AMAZING!!!!! The donuts are light and fluffy, not greasy and the flavors are absolutely delicious!! Drip coffee is $1 which is a very welcome surprise! I would stop by even just for the coffee because it is delic. The staff is so welcoming and friendly. I cannot say enough good things about this place. I tell everyone I meet to go try it!",positive,restaurant
179488,"Great ice cream flavors and neat local ice cream place! If you are into ice cream, put this on your list",positive,restaurant
179532,"I really wanted to come here after I heard that there was an option to get your ice cream served on top of egg waffles! They did not disappoint. Since my family and I came here right after dinner and birthday cake, we were already pretty stuffed, so we all shared. We got marzipan (almond) and black sesame ice cream. The black sesame was really good, but wow, the marzipan blew me away. It had a rich almond flavor and wasn't too sweet. It went perfectly with the hot, fresh, egg waffles. I also loved the whipped cream on top. This is a small local business that makes its own ice cream in small batches. I hear that the flavors rotate every day, so there is a lot of variety. It is quality stuff and I will definitely be back here as much as possible!",positive,restaurant
179582,"Cute little place in Ohio City within a good walking distance of West Side Market. They have awesome flavors here. I got a churro sandwich Taro+Matcha-Oreo & my boyfriend got a churro sandwich of Thai Iced Tea+Cap'n Crunch. SO. GOOD. Even without the cereal, the ice cream STILL tasted like Cap'n Crunch!",positive,restaurant
179585,"Updating my review from four to five stars because I was back for another visit last night, and I was excited to see interesting, creative, and yummy flavors. I was also impressed with the improved texture of my ice cream this go around. I got the lavender ice cream which absolutely delighted my senses and my hard-to-please elderly friend enjoyed his oatmeal cream pie ice cream ""very much"". I can't wait to go back and try some other flavors (blueberry mint, lucky charms, frenvh toast, etc.), or a cookie ice cream sandwich, affogato, or a waffle cone.",positive,restaurant
179591,"An update of the review for Mason's Creamery in its new Winter Mode as a Ramen Shop. They have modified the stand so that the counter is set up for diners and they have enclosed the patio with some tables and chairs to provide a small dining room, overall casual, but just fine for some really good ramen. The menu is concise with 3 main options, a pork tonkotsu ramen, a chicken version and a veggie version. I of course had the vegetarian version. My ramen came out quickly, with a large bowl filled with a large portion of noodles, a thick mushroom broth, soft boiled egg, mushrooms, seaweed and corn. The broth is thicker then I was expecting, but rich and warm, it really livened up when I added some of the spice powder and spicy oil that was available. The noodles were excellent, with just the right texture to make for a great meal. The highlight of the other items were the mushrooms adding great flavor and texture to the meal. Overall a great well balanced meal; the flavors were very good and the portion was enough to fill you up. If you are looking for a great meal at a decent price, you should consider hitting the ramen shop at Mason's Creamery during this winter.",positive,restaurant
179602,I love everything about this ice cream spot. I love it's central neighborhood location which makes it great for walking or biking too. I love the vibe of its pretty large patio on a summer night. And I love the ice cream. The flavors change frequently and there certainly are unique ones on the list. There are vegan flavors as well and unlike other popular ice cream places they change frequently too and there are always a handful of options. I've had vegan ice cream at various places around town and I would rate the texture / consistency of the vegan ice cream here #2 in town. But because of the flavor variety and rotation this place is my #1 go to for ice cream.,positive,restaurant
179676,"I've only been here a couple times but each time was fantastic. They always have such interesting and dynamic flavors. Earl Grey is delicious for tea lovers, and the vegan options are reliably tasty.",positive,restaurant
179697,"I LOVE this place so much. The ice cream flavors are so unique and culturally diverse. For example, I just had a combination of Matcha Oreo and Halva ice creams! They also have other fun flavors like: Vietnamese Coffee, Hojicha, and Marzipan. Each ice cream definitely tastes like what they claim to be- definitely not something to take for granted. Each flavor has a unique consistency to is as well. The best part of this establishment is the service from the people who work there. They are so patient while customers try all the flavors and love input for what their new flavors should be. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for locally sourced quality ice cream in Cleveland!",positive,restaurant
179739,"I adore Mason's ice cream! Not only are they great people, but they make great ice cream too. They are always trying new and different flavors. From olive oil to earl gray. I was blown away by the Cleveland Whiskey ice cream. It packed every bit of whiskey flavor without any of the heat you get from drinking whiskey. What a great way for non-whiskey-drinkers to see why Cleveland Whiskey is flying off the shelves. They get creative with the toppings as well. You would not believe how good sriracha sauce can be on ice cream until you try it. It adds just a little kick and a lot of flavor to the vegan vanilla. That is another great thing - they make lots of different vegan flavors. There is always something fun for vegans to try like avocado or roasted banana. Flavor, flavor, flavor! There is nothing like small batch ice cream. With Mason's Creamery you get beautiful subtle flavors coming through in each bite like a complex wine. I'll take that over the over-sugared and over-processed stuff any day!",positive,restaurant
179754,"Small, local business with high-quality ice cream and a friendly staff! The flavors are constantly changing, so it's always fun to go and try new things. And they are generous with their free samples to ensure you pick one that is just right. Does it get any better? Actually, yes.... You can choose to smush your ice cream between warm, fresh cookies, waffles or churros. Last night I went for the butterfinger and brownie batter flavors between chocolate chip cookies, and as usual, I was not disappointed. Give it a go!",positive,restaurant
179802,"Ridiculously good ice cream. Quaint little shop in the heart of Ohio City. Unique flavor combinations, made on site, vegan options. Super friendly, down to earth staff - let's you try any flavor and they are dog friendly. Got the chance to chat with one of the owners on our visit - local guy totally invested in the city. I had caramelized pear which was absolutely amazing. You will get flavor combinations here that you won't get anywhere else. This may just be my new favorite ice cream shop. Can't wait to go back and see what new flavors they have come up with",positive,restaurant
179821,"What a cool way to bring back some of my favorite cartoons from the 90s plus milkshakes, A taste worth remembering.. Can't go wrong at all. Some extra deets... parking was pretty packed on the weekend but close. The cost wasn't bad at all and worth it. Paid around $20 for 3. Even though it's the 90s it was more of the cartoons and design but the place could use some upgrades. Didn't want to sit inside. Besides that I Highly recommend.",positive,restaurant
179828,I love Ninety's. The place looks great post renovations and they have a multitude of options. I always get the Bottom of the Cereal Bowl shake. It's very sweet and creamy while also having the best ice cream topping -- cereal. It's a little pricey but that doesn't stop this place from being a hit on the boardwalk every night.,positive,restaurant
179863,"Multiple ice cream flavors to choose from. I loveeee ""bottom of the cereal bowl"" with fruity pebbles. I only gave 4 stars bc the line is always long but definitely a place I love to visit! I would recommend Ninety's for sure!",positive,restaurant
179915,Finally got around to trying this place. I really thought the ice cream sandwich would have cookies not macaroons. I settled for the brownie sandwich with the strawberry shortcake ice cream topped with pecans. There was an iPad with photos of different combinations of sandwiches but there were so many I did not have time to look at them all. They were also pretty busy. Being my first time I was really confused about what to order and wanted more explanations and patience to help me but that area was a little lacking with the service. Thy offer a student discount as well. I felt really overloaded with sugar because I'm not a heavy sweets eater but I do recommend going here because it's different and great for people with a sweet tooth.,positive,restaurant
179950,Favorite things on the menu are the strawberry shortcake milkshake and the banana split! probably spend about $7 each on both. Always pretty busy but the wait isn't long at all.,positive,restaurant
179979,Good ice cream. Lots of cool varieties of toppings. Chill vibe at the boardwalk. They also have non-dessert items but I have never had any of them or ever really seen anyone order them so I cannot comment on those. The decor is minimalistic but cute.,positive,restaurant
180094,"Initially, when we walked in the door it was very crowded, but the line moved fast. My boyfriend and I both got macaroon ice cream sandwiches and edible cookie dough on a stick. The sandwich was perfect and he definitely agreed. I enjoyed the cookie dough, but my boyfriend did not want his. When I tasted his, it tasted like straight up salt. Maybe that batch wasn't stirred properly?",positive,restaurant
180097,Yummy!!! I love cookies and cream so of course I tried that flavor which was amazing. But since I also love coffee I just had to try the coffee cookies and cream. OMG!!!! The best coffee ice cream mix I've ever had. Surely recommend this place. They didn't receive 5 stars cause their service could be better and there wasn't any tissue in the restroom. But the ice cream is delish.,positive,restaurant
180141,"I've heard so many great things about this ice cream shop and I finally got a chance to check it out. This place is super popular, we ended up waiting in line for maybe 15-20 minutes but the ice cream is worth the wait. I got the butterscotch sundae and the ice cream was so incredibly creamy. Probably one of the best soft serves I've ever had in my life. The parking situation here is pretty bad though so be prepared if you make the drive over and try going earlier in the day to avoid a huge crowd. The ice cream here is so good though that it's worth the trip!",positive,restaurant
180152,"Even though it was freezing out when we came to get our ice cream, our second experience was better than the first. Music from loudspeakers kept us entertained while we waited, distanced, in the long line of masked customers. It moved relatively quickly for how labor intensive it is to make custom ice cream orders. This time the server rang us up immediately, and there is a separate area for waiting for your order. Hubby had a small raspberry sundae, and I had a small turtle sundae. It was just the right amount, and so good. We ate in our car with the heat on and plan to be back if we're in the neighborhood.",positive,restaurant
180163,"On our recent trip to Pittsburgh, we were finally able to stop at this gem. We tend to only come during the winter when it is closed, so it was very exciting to be there when this ice cream stand was open. Not being a Pittsburgh native, we had no idea of the backstory of this place or how amazing it would be. They have an amazing variety of ice cream treats and delicious soft serve. We went twice over the weekend. The line is definitely shorter during the day, and they are cash only. We tried soft serve,, waffle sundae, a dipped cone, an Arctic Blast and a cold brew shake, loved it all.",positive,restaurant
180186,THE BEST ICE CREAM IN THE BURGH! So many ice cream options... and let's not forget pup cups!,positive,restaurant
180235,"I don't know how I lived in Pittsburgh for five years without trying this place. But I finally did and my life has been CHANGED! I love ice cream and this place is just the best! I love that they have so many flavors of soft serve - I think that sets them apart from many other places. They also have so many unique sundaes and other ice cream treats that I can't wait to try! I do wish they had bicycle parking - my husband and I rode their bikes down there and it started raining once we were there. There was nowhere to lock up our bikes, otherwise we would have just taken an uber home and come back for them later.",positive,restaurant
180237,"This is always our go-to ice cream place. My kids and I have been coming for years! Lines can get a little hectic, but it's worth the chaos. They have everything from flavored soft serve, to tropical snow, to milkshakes, to sundaes, to Arctic swirls (blizzards). Not to mention their other hot food, such as their fries and burgers, plus straight-from-the-barrel root beer, all make for a pretty satisfying treat on a warm summer night.",positive,restaurant
180279,"This place is such a gem under an overpass. I drive past Page Dairy Mart every day after work and there is always a long line at 3:30 in the afternoon, even in a downpour of rain. I finally stopped one day and it was so good... it's now going to become a bad habit. I went simple - swirl soft serve ice cream on a cake coke. So yummy and nostalgic. They have tons of flavors and dips though, so I hope to try out more in the future. Maybe I'll even try one of the many sundaes they advertise! There is no inside- you order from a window. They don't accept cash but there is an ATM around the corner of the building. The menu is pretty extensive so make sure you're studying all the options while you're waiting in line! The parking situation is decent- there are a lot of spots that surround Page's.",positive,restaurant
180283,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, I know, I know, that was naughty. But it was oh sooooooooooooooooooo Good! We split a medium turtle sundae. It is just your average soft serve ice cream. What makes them truly fabulous is the whole package. The turtle had the most wonderful slightly warm toasted salted pecans and plenty of them. The sundae was perfectly put together such that I was able to have toppings in every bite. The medium size was plenty big enough for us to split and feel satisfied with our naughtiness. You can park under the overpass which is actually super cool looking and oddly urban romantic. Prices are exactly where you want them, family spending friendly. I love this place!",positive,restaurant
180368,100% Pittsburgh treasure! The Carmel sauce is the secret winner but also the burgers and rib eye sandwich! .......The soft serve is a totally different object! That's The Godfather! It tastes like 1955 all over!!,positive,restaurant
180386,"i love this place more than any other place ever before in the history of places and me eating at them. not only is the ice cream made from local heroes,turner dairy, but the man who operates this fine establishment, chuck page, is one of the friendliest people in pittsburgh. there are so many options, i hate to say i've gotten the same thing more than twice, a couple of faves: thin mint artic swirl coffee ice cream with chocolate sprinkles southside shake!!!(sundae on top of a milkshake) best ever!",positive,restaurant
180388,Love this place. The soft serve is so yummy! My mom always took us to get ice cream here in the summer when we came to visit. Just stopped here two days ago and it was just as delicious as I remembered! I just hate trying to pull out of this place because traffic is always so busy in every direction.,positive,restaurant
180390,"If you never drove down East Carson street, you are missing out on PageDM. Not far from the hopping SSide but in a strange looking spot next to a bridge and at a not so fun corner with a little parking lot. But the ice cream is to scream for! Flavored soft serve ice cream, a Yinzburg Sundae, a vanilla shake with some real vanilla flavoring. The Original Root Beer Barrel is still in the window! Delicious. Cash only.",positive,restaurant

180431,"I went to the Mary cole ice cream Parlor yesterday for the first time and let me tell you, it was the cutest little diner ever! The theme was set to around the 1950s! The service was incredible, the cashier felt (maddog) made you feel so welcomed and excited to be there! The Waiter alongside him was quick and really helpful. I highly recommend trying!",positive,restaurant

180515,"What a treat!!!! The young man who greeted us had amazing customer service skills. He had complete knowledge of all the varieties and choices, and was so delightful to talk to. My husband and I both got a single (2 scoops) sundae with all sorts of wonderful toppings ... we called this dinner. The flavors, texture, portions, and such were all perfection. The shop was clean, had a vintage vibe, and was a joy to visit. We will be back when we are in Phoenix.",positive,restaurant
180574,"I would fondly consider myself an undercover hot fudge snob. Bring me chocolate sauce... and I would rather eat the ice cream plain. In my humble snob opinion, THIS PLACE UNDERSTANDS THE ART OF A SUNDAE. The decor is just so inviting and sweet! Not to mention, the staff goes above and beyond to make your time special! The in house churned ice cream was perfect in flavor and consistency. While devouring each decadent spoonful, after one hot mess of a day, this sundae brought me back to simpler sweet days of my youth. This parlor will provide the type of retrospective emersion that cannot help but bring one to a state of pure ecstasy. All that to say: - bad days can be redeemed - good hot fudge exists - Mary Coyle has left one heaping spoonful of a legacy",positive,restaurant
180613,They have a really nice assortment of sweets. I got a birthday cake cupcake and a cinnamon roll cookie. The cupcake was very cute and had a nice flavor. The inside felt like it was slightly undercooked but still very yummy. Not too sweet. I didn't even eat the cookie because it was very doughy and just seemed like it wasn't cooked at all. The little cinnamon bun on the top was good. Again not too sweet.,positive,restaurant
180625,I HIGHLY recommend a red velvet milkshake with Oreos. And they have the big straws! Their chocolates are also delicious. Only downside is that they usually only have one employee working which can cause a slight wait depending on when you visit.,positive,restaurant
180669,I just don't know where to start: Shakes Cake Pops Truffles & More... This is one nifty little chocolate shoppe. One would be hard pressed to find much better. The textures and flavors are make such an incredible sensation in the mouth and stomach. Seriously I love the truffles made with Bulleit and the mint truffles make my head spin with delight. Convenient Cultural District location makes it a perfect stop for an after show treat.,positive,restaurant
180675,"I stopped in here late, right before closing. They were extremely nice and helpful! I work in a pastry kitchen and you'd think I'd get tired of sweets!

They held up the line to yell at the nice girl that helped me and her manager when they told her that the no return policy was on her receipt and she said she didn't read the receipt. Next time you wanna buy a kid a $40 toy, make sure it's the right one.

Not since Ferris Bueller's Day Off have I been this attracted to a Sloan ... with my vision focused downward staring at her perfectly round beautiful donuts. Yes, I like big donuts and I can not lie. You other Yelpers can't deny. That when you walk by Sloan's with an itty bitty diet and see those round things in your face you get young. Sorry, I'm hooked and I can't stop staring. Oh, baby, I wanna eat cha and take your picture. Other Yelp boys tried to warn me, but that donut you got makes me so hungry. We entered Sloan's. There was a line. People were getting candies and ice cream in fresh cones, but my focus never left those big ass donuts on display in the window. Oh my God ... Olivia, look at her donut. Its sooo big. She looks like one of those Yelp guys girlfriends. Who understands those Yelp guys. They only come here because of ice cream & donuts to boot. I mean her donut ... It's just so big, I can't believe it's so round ... It's just out there ... I mean, it's the most ... Look at Sloan's donut rack ...",positive,restaurant

180976,What delicious treats they have. This bakery is known for their s'mores brownies but their oatmeal cream pies and puddle cookies are truly to die for. I do wish the opening hours were still 7am so I could stop there before work but that will just make when I can get there that much more special. If you're lucky when you go you'll see the owner Cristina who is so sweet!,positive,restaurant
180980,"I had been absolutely DYING to try a bakery in West Charlotte, the Batchmaker Batch House, but the hours make it difficult for me to get here. They're only open while supplies last, between 8 AM and 3 PM, Tuesday-Saturday. When you work weekdays (like I do), the hours are not conducive to getting here! If they opened an hour earlier, I could get here more regularly. Until then, Saturdays are my only shot at making it in. It's a very limited menu, too, except on Saturdays when they showcase a wide array of goods. They WILL sell out though, so I highly recommend getting here as early as possible! This small little shop features a menu of rotating sweet treats throughout the week. There are a couple of tables outside the shop, and if it weren't for COVID, I'd love to sit in the super-cute, midcentury styled seating area inside -- complete with sofa, accent chair, a few tables, and a small bar you can work from (or simply sit and enjoy a snack). Alas, only two people are currently allowed in at a time. I love that the owner is 100% self-taught with no formal training. It makes the bakery feel more real and community-driven. I had no formal training when I worked as a chef, so I admire its owner. Heck, maybe I'll apply for a weekend job. Trade a few secrets as something to do. When I went, the service was extremely slow. It took a solid 10-15 minutes per customer, and when only two people are allowed in at a time due to COVID, the line moves at a snail's pace. I arrived at 9 AM, and it took about 40 minutes for me to get inside. The line only continued to build up behind me. I HIGHLY recommend you get there for opening, and just know that there is no ""running in"" for a quick treat here. Here's what I ordered: Tres Leches Draft Iced Latte. They partnered with Hex Coffee in Charlotte to offer this draft latte. It's on tap and tastes more like a dessert than a coffee. It's creamy, sweet, and delicious -- with just a hint of coffee. I TOTALLY recommend it! S'mores Cupcake. I have mixed feelings about this. Overall, it was one of my favorite things I tried. The chocolate cake was PERFECTION! It was fluffy, moist, and chocolatey... what's not to love? The marshmallow was great too. The one negative for me is that the frosting was too sweet -- like so sweet you think your teeth might fall out. If the frosting were a marshmallow frosting that was then garnished with a fancily designed graham cracker, this would be my go-to every time. I can't stop thinking about how good the chocolate cake portion was! Oatmeal Cream Pie. This is what the bakery is famous for. It's like a ""Little Debbie Oatmeal CrÃ¨me Pie"" but SOOOO MUCH BETTER. I find the Little Debbie one sickly sweet (like the frosting from the S'mores cupcake). The Oatmeal Cream Pie at Batchmaker is heavenly. It has insanely good vanilla and marshmallow filling that oozes out in the best way possible. This was my favorite thing I tried -- and quite frankly, if the line weren't so long, I would have gone back inside for another one. Pro tip: Sometimes, they offer a variation where they put the filling between two Oreo Truffle Cookies, which has to be INSANELY GOOD. Oreo Truffle Cookie. This is an excellent cookie. I love Oreos, and this was a whole new level of deliciousness. It's chewy with a slight Oreo/slight vanilla flavor. It's sweet but much more subdued than an Oreo is. I'd call this perfection. If you like Oreos, these are DEFINITELY worth a try. Cinnamon Coffee Cake. This was good, but a disappointment compared to everything else. Don't get me wrong; it's a knock-out for coffee cake -- it's soft, moist, and has just the right amount of cinnamon. Everything else was just so dang good; this felt a bit boring. Caramel Scone. Perhaps it was caramel apple? It tasted like a delicious apple pie, so I think there was apple in it -- but maybe my brain was playing tricks on me. I can't find it on their menu, and it didn't have a sign when I was there, so maybe I imagined it... Anyhow... it's terrific if they do have it available when you visit. Turtle Cookie. These are BRAND NEW to the menu. It's a chocolate cookie covered in caramel and topped with sea salt and a pecan. It was delicious! And definitely more chocolatey than the caramel and pecan flavor of a traditional turtle. If you're looking for something soft and chewy, this is your YUM! Strawberry Pop Tart. THANK GOD real pop tarts don't taste like this -- I'd quickly be on the way to ""my 500lb life."" This deliciously flakey pastry is almost a pie crust with a slight sweetness: it's a perfect pop tart. They make a few other flavors too, like blueberry, brown sugar, and PB+J (all of which I need to try). S'mores Brownie. I paid for this; however, they forgot to put it in my box. After I got home, I reached out to them when I realized it was missing, and they were super sweet and embarrassed about it. Next time I come in, they'll give me the one I paid for, plus another to make up for it!",positive,restaurant
181100,"Delicious as the last few times! I can't get enough of Honey Hut. Whenever I am in the area, I MUST stop by! Believe all the 5 star reviews. This place is so worth it!",positive,restaurant
181130,"The OG neighborhood ice cream joint providing satisfying (and cheap) scoops to be enjoyed outdoors. I finally got around to visiting this Cleveland staple after waiting all winter, since they're only open for the spring and summer months. A major selling point - and I suspect the cause of their Cleveland Scene Best Ice Cream 2016 Award - of Honey Hut is probably the nostalgia factor, and nothing screams old school like a whitewashed literal hut off the side of the road. Luckily, they at least anticipated their popularity with a sizable parking lot (enter off Buechner Ave). The awning over the hut only extends out a few feet or so, so in rain or extreme sunshine it might be wise to bring an umbrella to protect from the elements while waiting in line. There were two order windows in operation when I went, plus a few more staffers within the large space inside the stoop making the more effort-intensive orders like smoothies, shakes, and sundaes. When my turn came to order, I was shocked to realize that I had been agonizing so much over which flavors to choose that I didn't notice my two hefty scoops cost only $3. Jesting, I am not. I chose to treat myself under the semi-covered patio, but know that when bad weather hits the gaps in the cross-hatched roof won't provide much protection. The Honey Pecan seems to be the OG flavor here, so I tried and enjoyed, but was a bit disappointed that it was mostly pecan and barely there honey. I liked my Dark Chocolate Cayenne seasonal flavor more, with its subtle spicy buzz at the end. The consistency was thick but not the custard consistency I was expecting. It also wasn't as creamy as those served at Mitchell's and Piccadilly and there were some icy spots in my ice cream. Good old-fashioned flavors without too many frills, and I would happily spend another $3 for a dependable - if not first-rate - cone.",positive,restaurant
181212,"I lived in Chicago for 20 years, and now live in Chicago. I first went to the West Side Market when I saw Michael Simon talk about Chucrazj Meats on the Food Network. I started going to the West Side Market when in town to meet up with friends when we went fishing for walleye out of Lorain, or when I was driving through town on my way from Chicago to my hometown in Rochester NY. It was an absolute MUST! This is how I discovered Campbell's. They not only have a popcorn stand with some sweet treats like marshmallows painted like Minions, but also the buckeyes there are ridiculously tasty. They also have a cupcake and treats stand there in the market as well, which is where we discovered the wedding cake ""truffles"" or as I like to call them cake balls. We love all the different flavors, but this specific one hits different. Has an almond taste, the texture of the cake is so special, and you know it's just perfect when all of your friends start begging you to bring some back. We now have a system where we call the plant up a week or more in advance of someone being in the area to pick up our order. We went fishing in Port Clinton this past weekend, so someone driving in from the Western PA in our group ""volunteered"" (we demanded he do it) to make a special order for us. We ordered 4 dozen wedding cake truffles, and 2 dozen of ""you pick it"" variety. They have M&M, Red Velvet, Chocolate peanut butter (like buckeyes), so many! So- we basically ordered 72 cake balls and one dozen buckeyes for a weekend fishing trip. There are three of us who adore this place. I am proudly the person who found it, and so I am always happy when we get a chance to get here and eat some treats! I am a type 2 diabetic, and so I have to say that it's tough not to eat my entire share of goodies when I make an order. But this time, I am giving away some of the truffles to friends here in Atlanta so they can also enjoy the goodness. Quality is so good, the pricing is what it is (thanks inflation) but we know that spending extra money on something so delicious and special is a ""treat"" and we appreciate the time spent hand making and the craftsmanship involved. Please support small businesses like Campbells. Their flavored popcorn is also pretty addictive, so be forewarned! Thank you Campbell's. I will be back, hopefully in September when we try to come back in town for more Lake Erie Walleye fishing!",positive,restaurant

181284,"Campbell's Popcorn Shop is the latest food destination I'm recommending to people. Usually it goes ""OMG. I wish I had some Dichotomy Mix right now!"" It doesn't matter the time of day, or if I'm hungry. I just love the cheddar/caramel corn mix. People usually say ""Wutch you talkin' bout, Willis?"" and then I tell them all about Campbell's. I like that I can try any flavors from a neat little vending sample machine from the counter. There are also chocolate creations like turtles and peanut butter cups. You may purchase your popcorn by regular or large bags, or tins! I made a special trip on Saturday to Ohio City just to stop and get a couple of bags of the Dichotomy for double booked Saturday parties. I love it when you introduce people to a superior food product and you can literally see the moment while they're taking their first bites and they realize it is superior. I had several of those moments on Saturday night. So far, no matter how good the other flavors are, and they are all good, I have only bought dichotomy. When you've found the best, can you really deviate? Don't Deviate from Dichotomy is my slogan for 2012. Dig it?",positive,restaurant
181337,"This crepe stand is inside the West Side Market. There was a pretty short line, but the process took awhile because there are only 3 crepe machines for cooking. Can't really blame the worker though he kept moving the entire time. The menu offers good suggestions or you can make your own crepe. I got one with asparagus, ham and brie and really enjoyed it. With both sweet and savory options this is a good spot for lunch or a snack. There's a coffee stand right next to the crepe stand which is convenient as well.",positive,restaurant
181384,"This ice cream is incredible. The flavors, the creaminess, the texture. I could go on and on. I got the cappuccino macchiato and the cookie dough. And I loved them both equally.

181388,"BLUE MOON ICE CREAM!! I'm sorry. Let me rewind just a moment. We had spent the morning and early afternoon around State Street, campus and the Capitol area. After visiting two free art museums, eating some sushi, and walking up and down State Street in the hot, hot heat...we were easily talked in to stopping for some ice cream. The Daily Scoop is in the Union building, and prices are very reasonable. I got to try my friend's orange chocolate chip and it tasted JUST like the Christmas candy! But when I looked at the menu of the available flavors and I saw BLUE MOON....well, I was over the moon! My mouth watered and I was filled with a joyous rush of nostalgia! Blue Moon was my absolute favorite ice cream flavor growing up. I have not encountered it outside of Wisconsin (although, to be honest, I don't eat a great deal of ice cream any more....). I don't know what it is...apparently the flavor is actually vanilla and orange together, but colored blue. And I don't know how the color might affect the taste, but it doesn't just taste like a creamy orange....it just tastes wonderful! I was only going to to get a single scoop in a dish. But when it comes to Blue Moon ice cream....I am pretty proud of myself for stopping myself at two scoops. A little less willpower and I might have eaten the entire tub in their freezer! Once you get your sweet treat, you can take it outside to enjoy the view of and breeze from the lake. People watch and eat your ice cream as it melts. It was a great way to end the afternoon. Certainly worth a visit!",positive,restaurant

I went to the grand opening and had ""Unicorn Breathe"" which was fruity pebbles, lucky charms, whipped cream, cookies, and strawberry drizzle. I had it with whole milk but there are other milk options. There are two bars on the inside where you can dine in and a table for outside dining. I think it fits right in with the neighborhood and the surrounding businesses. I would definitely go here on a date, with friends, or when I just want a unique bowl of cereal or cool milkshake. This is also a black owned business so I will definitely be spreading the word as much as possible. There is street parking near and also a parking deck. It's right across the street from a park as well so you can enjoy your cereal or milkshake there!",positive,restaurant
181479,"Just visited a few minutes ago (on a Sunday around lunch) and ran to Yelp to write this review :) This is such a cute little shop right in the heart of uptown across from Bearden park. There was a line but we placed our orders after about 15 min of waiting. The cashier was very kind and was the only one working in the shop. Also the store was only making shakes today and no bowls which was a bummer. But the shakes were delicious ! We got Unicorn Breath and Mucha Lucha, price was reasonable about $8 per shake. Support local, black owned businesses and definitely stop by if you're in the area !",positive,restaurant
181550,"I highly enjoy the creativity that goes into the food and drink items, the decor of the shop, and the variety of things available to try on a regular basis. I also love supporting a local owner. Most of what my family has bought has ranged from very good to excellent. For example, the gluten-free options are outstanding, including the brown sugar oat cupcakes and the carrot cupcakes. The egg-free chocolate cookie is very rich with a distinct chocolate flavor and wonderful texture. I can also attest to the quiche and have tried at least two flavors. Her bread puddings are also terrific. There are some items that aren't a runaway success but am not opting to list those. Instead, here's a handful of reasons why it's not a 5-star review for me: 1) The espresso-based drinks are not always very hot. Temperature is crucial to a really good espresso drink, especially if you are going to spend $5 or more on it. 2) The attitudes of the employees are not always stellar. The last two times I have picked up items from Hopscotch to go, each young woman behind the counter who rang me up were coolly polite at best. There wasn't service with a smile or any kind of cheerfulness, even when I would try to engage about the items. I felt as if I was inconveniencing each of them being there. The first time it happened, I chalked it up to the person having a bad day. But the second time, with a different person, I had someone else with me who also thought it was a stiff transaction for being such a homey place. This might seem like a small thing but for me, this makes the difference of being a regular versus going only once every few months. 3) During peak times, it would be an improvement if there were more than one person behind the counter, e.g. one person making hot drinks and another person helping those in line who are picking out baked goods. Tip: don't go here in a hurry. All in all, a great place to go when you have time, and you want to try locally-made delicious treats or pick up a unique gift for a loved one. It's also conveniently located in the center of town.",positive,restaurant

162030,"I used to looove this place (hence my previous 5 star review), but the last few times it's been so beyond lacking in service. I don't know if it's what I've been ordering or what, but it takes forever! And I don't think a shake at an ice cream place is crazy. People will get served way before and I've had to ask if my stuff is going to come out. When you ask it's like a lightbulb comes on and they realize they forgot your items. I asked for two scoops of ice cream the first time and that took 25 minutes to get (after asking about it). This most recent time was a mint chocolate chip ""bowl"" (which came out timely but melted all over my jeans and car by the end of it because they couldn't give me a lid) and a strawberry shortcake shake (which took crazy long to produce). I love this place, but I have no idea what is happening.",negative,restaurant
162135,"All of the positive things I have to say about this place have to do with the branding and the service - the guy working was super nice and patient, waiting for us to make up our minds for what probably felt to him like forever. We were having so much trouble because the drink menu looked SO tempting. Eventually, we ordered: a cocoa puffs chocolate brownie ice cream monstrosity for him; a coconut milk/matcha drink for me, 20% sugar (yes, they allow you to choose your sugar percentage down to the percentage point. Awesome). So something really awful must have happened for me to give one star at this point, right? Yeah. The drink happened. The drink was just... terrible. Instead of using actual coconut milk, they used what tasted like an avalanche of artificial coconut flavor. Maybe there was actual coconut milk under there, but I honestly couldn't tell. It tasted like a Mounds bar. The matcha, layered on top, was visible, you know, visually, but taste-wise it may as well have been green water. Then, to top it off, the boba were like Aunt Jemima's ""maple"" corn syrup sweetness bombs. The combination was so repugnant that I failed to finish my drink even though it was 110 outside, I had just finished rock climbing, and I was parched. It just made me feel nauseous to sip it. We ended up going somewhere else to get cold drinks. The guy working did let me know that he would be willing to adjust my drink if I didn't like it - but there are no 'adjustments' that would have saved this drink beyond throwing it away and starting over.",negative,restaurant
162174,"Visiting from out of town, read the reviews so decided to try it out since it closed a little late. Got there just right before they closed, a little expensive for 3 drinks and ice cream in a cup. Drinks weren't all that great, even the ice cream didn't taste good. Waste of my money, I would say bcz didn't even drink half of my drink before I decided to toss it in the trash!",negative,restaurant

162207,"I probably would have given a 3 star, but my 2 visits left a bitter aftertaste. On my first visit it was really packed. So I couldn't ask about pricing or how ordering worked. My sister and I thought the ice cream was good, but really heavy and sweet. The service was fast, but not really friendly since it felt like they were in training mode and I felt really rushed. The cashier making my order also forgot I ordered a second ice cream. So I had to remind her. On top of that, I kept getting weird looks that I couldn't decipher... maybe annoyed. Plus, she also forgot my extra topping, which is 50 cents extra. I had to remind her yet again. It was a really meager amount too. She also got chocolate drizzle all over the sides of the cup, but she kind of quickly wiped it down when she was instructed to. But I still got chocolate all over my hands. The ice cream was also really expensive for how small the portion size was. I paid about $16 for the two ice creams and the extra topping on both. So it ended up being around $6ish for each. I had no idea what the pricing would be until after I ordered because the price wasn't listed for the signature items on their wall menu. The cashier also didn't give me a receipt until I asked, so I had no idea what I paid since I missed what the total was due to the choatic environment. On a side note, when paying, you swipe for debit and insert chip for credit. The cashier didn't explain this. So my card wouldn't go through when I chose debit and inserted my card.. She didn't bother explaining why my card wouldn't go through. So I just ended up guessing and tried swiping. My card finally went through. They really need to take the time to communicate no matter how busy it is. It left a bad impression. I decided to give it another try the next day since I was in the area. I didn't know what time they opened, so I ended up coming too early and waited close to 30 minutes. When I entered, I heard the cashier kind of groan or make some sound similiar to a groan. I felt unwelcomed, but I ignored it since I waited 30 minutes since my sister really wanted a drink. I ended up getting two drinks: the Matcha Coffee and the Strawberry Matcha Latte. The cashier for this second visit also did not tell me about the payment process. She chose credit for me, and I inserted my card since I remembered the other day that I chose debit and needed to swipe. This was annoying because if I had a card without a chip, and I tried swiping after she chose credit for me my card wouldn't have gone through. Anyway, the coffee drink for the price definitely wasn't worth it. They add plain cane sugar for the coffee. For the price, I was hoping for honey or a higher quality sweetener. But the strawberry latte was good. It just needed more strawberry syrup. Although how they make the drinks seem inconsistent. I was watching the drink making process, and the cashier was using two different brands of almond milk because it must have ran out. Anyway, my sister noticed that her almond milk was low quality and tasted bad before she mixed her latte. I didn't even tell her that it was low quality milk, until after she told me her observation. They used Great Value almond milk in her drink, while they used Simple Truth in mine. For the price, they should use a good brand of milk substitute. The cheap stuff tends to taste bad. She liked the matcha though. She thought it might have been a high quality matcha. I have to agree on that. I ended up googling them since I was curious about the reviews because my overall experience was pretty bad. When browsing the pictures, I noticed that our ice cream was definitely much smaller and it was more of a heavy concrete texture compared to the light swirls in the pictures. I took the ice creams togo. So I guess they cut the size down to get the lid on. They should have told me I would get more than 50% less ice cream if I got a lid. They need to get bigger lids or something. Although what angered me was that in the pictures, the Cookies and Cream ice cream had Cocoa Puffs and Cookie Crisps. However, my ice cream definitely did not have any of those toppings. When I ate it the day before, I just assumed they blended it into my ice cream. Lastly, the Minion's Treat was either missing the almonds or it was such a skimpy amount that I couldn't see it or taste it. The ice creams in the pictures had a decent amount of toppings for the exact ice creams we got. I don't know why we barely had any toppings and some of our toppings were missing. We are lactose intolerant. This was supposed to be a rare treat worth the stomach pains and other problems. The only nice thing about the experience was that the owner/manager/trainer or whatever her position is seemed nice. She told the girl making my order to wipe the chocolate drizzle off the sides of my cup because she was about to hand it to me without wiping it. She also got me a togo menu when I asked for one.",negative,restaurant

Unfortunately, all the treats we tried tasted like frying oil and nothing else. I couldn't even finish the lobster tail. I've had a few cannoli's from Modern Pasty and Mike's in Boston as well as Madonia's in NYC, so I have tried some amazing cannoli's and lobster tails. Unfortunately, I did not taste any good cannoli or lobster tails at Carlo's Bakery.",negative,restaurant
162380,We wanted to try it out on Sunday but the line was way too long. So the next time when we showed up and there was no line we bought a couple items.

162433,"I wanted to make custom cakes from them, but they have a HORRIBLE response time in replying to Email orders. I called and asked to make several custom cakes for friends of mine and they mentioned to email the request. I sent out an email request and received one reply out of the 4 emails I sent. The response time to that one email was a week later. Expect long waits throughout the day, with a shortage of staff. Workers are all still in training mode and incapable of dealing with large volume orders and dealing with crowds. Wait a few more weeks before going here, and hopefully they'll get their operation in order. Current management is poor, and don't bother emailing them Cake requests. PreMade cakes on the other hand turned out well. I picked up 2 of them for a friends birthday, and all thought the cake was delicious! one Star for that.",negative,restaurant

Overhyped. Not worth the wait. Or the money. Or the calories. A handful of mediocre cookies and pastries; $15.00. Two important life lessons taken away from this horrible place; priceless. Lesson 1. If you're ever feeling down, just remember that as long as you have a personality, everything else will be just fine. Lesson 2. Money really does buy nice things; including, but not limited to, one hell of a Marketing Director.",negative,restaurant
162451,"Disappointed. Just had a red velvet cupcake and I've actually had better from a grocery store bakery at home. The cake was very bland and the abundant icing was just saccharin sweet with no flavor aside from pure sugar.

I bout butter cookies to take to my kids and I threw them away as soon as I tasted them , bland with no butter taste. Its hard to accept criticism but I truly believe I am doing you a service.

162500,"Disappointed. I had visited Carlo's Bakery on a previous trip to Las Vegas and had a good experience. So good in fact, I knew it was a must stop on my recent trip there. However, I was not impressed and neither were my friends. We each got a cupcake though there weren't many flavors to choose from but you could never go wrong with chocolate or vanilla right?! Mind you, we went at 9:30 at night but Vegas is the city that never sleeps! Our cupcakes were dry and hard! If you're a Cakeboss fan and must stop here in Vegas, plan to stop early when the desserts are likely more fresh.",negative,restaurant
162503,"This place was HORRIBLE! We got the crumb cake, cheesecake, and nut bar thing. The nut bar thing almost broke my teeth! The crumb cake was SO DRY and so BLAND! The cheesecake was nothing special. Cheesecake Factory is 20 times better! Too pricey for NOT good quality. DO NOT GO HERE! Bouchon Bakery is THE BEST bakery in Vegas right now. Carlo's was the worst disappointment for this local.",negative,restaurant
162529,I was so happy to know that the bakery was in my hotel. What a disappointment!! I went there to get something for my birthday. I got the red velvet cupcake and the creampuff lobster tail. The red velvet cup cake was very salty and the lobster tail was stale was not even flaky at all. My husband had the vanilla cupcake and he said it was all right it was and all that. Very disappointed.,negative,restaurant
162540,"Was looking for a great cupcake in Vegas, unfortunately I didn't find it at Carlo's. The cake was dry and the frosting was thick, heavy and way too sweet. The brownie was okay, once I scraped off the frosting. Chocolate mousse cake was okay, again heavy, dense mousse. And to top it off we paid over 20 bucks for 2 cupcakes, a brownie and mini mousse cake, which would have been worth it, if it had all been delicious. Love the show, but not the cakes.",negative,restaurant
162592,I was very excited about this place as my daughter loves the show Cake Boss. We stood in a line that didn't move.

Needless to say.. we exited the line immediately.,negative,restaurant
162604,"First and last time coming here. The staff are very unhappy looking, rude, didn't even welcome us. A lot of people come here from watching the show Cake Boss, but we were very dissappointed.

We will not be coming here again.",negative,restaurant
162611,"I brought my children along with 2 nephews to Las Vegas for my sons birthday. They were excited to go to the bakery. On Saturday we got there and got #67 they were on 25 an hour later they were on number 33. The staff was extremely slow and seemed to be in no rush whatsoever. Sunday morning we went again at 830am thinking they wouldn't have such a long wait, and again we got number 67! This time they were on number 47... This is what I don't understand if they have two people helping the customers and they each take 10-15 minutes per customer then the cashier isn't doing anything for 10 minutes at a time. After 30 minutes we left they only moved up 4 numbers. My son was extremely disappointed and it was a sour end to his birthday. A person would think that they would put at least 4 people during peek times.",negative,restaurant
162655,"It's just a hype and I don't know why? The salespeople are moving very slow so it will built a longer line, I spent almost $100 just try a few of them but I was so disappointed, save your hard earned cash , not worth it.",negative,restaurant
162657,"I had the chocolate walnut meringue cookie, hazelnut lobster tail, and French cream lobster tail. I was disappointed with the cookie, it didn't have that fall apart on the outside, chewy on the inside type of texture. The fillings for the lobster tails were delicious but the crusts were meh. The pastries didn't seem to be freshly made. Oh pretty expensive. $5.50 per lobster tail.",negative,restaurant
162676,"Review is for taste of bakery items only. We are fans of the show so me and kids had to roll in and see the Cake Boss bakery. They didn't have any fabulous cakes displayed which was a disappointment. It was a Sunday in late July so no line to complain about. The quality of pastries wasn't all that. I actually let the kids have the cookies and we opted for Bouchon bakery instead. We tried the eclair, stuffed croissant, Canoli's and cookies. If I had to wait in a line for mediocre pastures I would've been pissed.",negative,restaurant

They packed my carrot cupcake in with my daughter's strawberry shortcake...not a good ideal! It was a mess by the time we made it to our room and we ended up throwing it away.

On the show, Buddy was very big on the importance of the ""sponge"" in a cake/cupcake. It should be moist, soft, and delightful. Me, my mom, my brother, and his girlfriend all bought one and tried it together and both cupcakes, the red velvet and the carrot cake, were dry! We tried a Canoli which was good and the Lobster tail was good as well but nothing was ""amazing"". The service was good but the desserts were a disappointment. Not to mention the desserts were pretty pricey so yea I'm not coming back.",negative,restaurant
162818,"We had a cannoli, a mini mouse cake and a nut brownie. They were okay, nothing fantastic. I can make better at home with box mix. The brownie was dry and was more cake like.

There was no line but we found a very limited selection (earlier in the day), it was a very small space and the girl behind the register could not answer any of my mothers questions (i.e.- will more product be made and put out for purchase, what time do you close tonight, etc. really?). We decided not to buy anything and make it a short visit due to the experience, not to mention the ridiculous prices! Yikes, needs some work to make things better for sure!",negative,restaurant

162852,"I don't know much about the show but I'm sure the guy is great and successful. My Aunt has been to the original bakery since the 90s and has said good things. This place needs to get their act together. There is one line to wait on to pick out what you would like. When you get up to the counter and someone helps you there are no descriptions, no prices for 90% of the items. I know this is going to be expensive because it's on the strip so I go ahead and get some things - black and white cookies, canoli, cream puffs, chocolate chip cookies and a 3-layer cookie - which is my favorite and a holiday tradition for me. I was very excited for this 3 layer cookie to compare it to my own. The employee puts everything on a tray, asks my name and tells me to wait in another line to pay and get my baked goods. ANOTHER LINE. I see them place things in boxes and wrap them up the NY way in red and white string which is great but I'm not getting 2 dozen italian cookies and I could for-go the boxing because I was handing out the treats to my family in 10 minutes. So we wait and wait and wait some more, around 20 minutes to pay. The poor cashier needs to go to a line of waiting orders, type in everything the person ordered and ring them up, then call the person's name - which is horrible inefficient. Overall, it took probably 40minutes from standing in line to finish and they forgot my 3 layer cookie which cost a fortune. Never, ever go there. Save yourself for a true italian bakery in NY. This place is waste of time and money.",negative,restaurant

162879,"After willing to try this place for a long time, I finally tried it, and decided that the long line wasn't really worth it at all. First of all, the food and customer service looked like a big joke. I ordered a crumb cake and a lobster tail which both looked dry. Second of all, the lack of organization in the tiny shop was ridiculous. The people behind me were paying in first and I was left for last. That immediately struck me as horrible customer service. But, it doesn't end there. When I got home I tried cutting the crumb cake, and it was stiff as a hockey puck. It just looked really old, and dry as I expected. Lastly, the lobster tail was soggy, mushy, and flavorless. In the end, I've saw Cake Boss and I expected that their pastries were going to be decadent and delicious, but it was not close to that. Try it at your own risk.",negative,restaurant
162897,"Incredibly disappointing experience. Boyfriend and I are big fans of Cake Boss, so of course we wanted to come here. The line was over an hour long, and the prices are ridiculous.

Don't fall into the hype.",negative,restaurant

I was about to explode at that time, when she called me wrong again, and when I literally asked ""what the heck is wrong with you"", she started to say ""I'm sorry - in between laughs"". In the end... I really didn't like the canoli - one of my very favorites pastries... too heavy... the lobster tail is very decent... will return? Absolutely not... not even when in Hoboken... VERY disappointed. Watching the man give other owners words of wisdom on how to improve their business, he could use some of those words on his own business. By the way... he was inside - talking to employees and not even a smile to the crowd outside... I think friendliness is just for TV.",negative,restaurant

I went to this location for the first time two months ago while travelling through Vegas, and the lobster tails were phenomenal. They had a French/Irish cream folded into the cream. It was worth the price. We went back today (only two months later) and ordered 6 of them to go. At $6 each.. when we got to eating them we were all severely disappointed that the famous lobster tails we love only had plain whipped cream in them. I do not think Buddy would approve of this location changing his recipe and selling this sub par product in his name. I never thought I would write a bad review about Carlos Bake shop.",negative,restaurant

Not only is that rude, but the world famous bakery wasn't worth the wait whatsoever. We ordered chocolate covered cannoli and Oreo cake. We were all disappointed and pretty much were thinking we wasted a half hour. No where to sit, rude worker handling line, rude worker taking order and rude cashier. Will not go back.",negative,restaurant
162963,I'm only giving this place one star because I didn't get to eat here. Why? Because they do a piss poor job in guiding you to this bitch. On the casino floor they advertise it everywhere. Then you start looking for it and there are no signs anywhere!! I had to ask 4 people that just told me to keep going. It's in BFE. Next to Rockhouse where you can't go any further.

My fudge cupcake- frosting was okay but I myself make better.. And finally, I got this cake thing- it was white chocolate mousse covered with chocolate. The mousse was WAY!! To sweet, and I wish the chocolate shell would have had a crunch to it. I know I bought some other items too, but overall I wasn't too empresses.. Waiting 2.5 hours and paying about $30 for something that I could make or buy in Wisconsin tasting better and cheaper than this place, why'd I even come??

163009,"Despite ordering and paying in full over 2 months in advance Carlo's did not make our wedding cake for our wedding day as contracted. We did not find out until we went to pick it up on the wedding day. To make things worse the supervisor had no idea how to use the computer to make things right, it took myself (The Groom) going down there during the reception along with 3 other people to make a scene and push them to just refund us cash and make a new cake on the spot, which was obviously extremely thrown together and not what we ordered. This caused a big delay in our party while all our guests waited for me to get back to the reception. Their excuse was that some hand off did not happen internally. I understand things happen but you do not just forget to make a wedding cake. Though the cash was refunded and we did end up with some kind of cake it doesn't make up for the guests missing out on the cake I specifically ordered and myself missing 45 minutes of my own reception. Do not use Carlo's catering for any event if you want your dessert as contracted.",negative,restaurant

When we got there the line wasn't as long as I expected from pictures that I've seen which I was pleased with. It was about a 25 minute wait to even get inside the bakery. When we finally got inside and waited for someone available to take our order the man didn't even look at me or ask if I had been helped before he greeted the lady behind me. I quickly said hello to him to get his attention, only then did he realize he skipped over me. My cousin and I had been standing for a while looking so we already had our order ready. I watched the man write down my order correctly and stepped aside to wait to be called. He called me over to check if my order was write. It was missing two things. I don't understand how you forget two things when you wrote it down and the case is literally two inches in front of your face, not to mention it wasn't a very big order. So I'm finally called up to pay and the women repeats my order back to me before charging me and everything she repeated was correct. It wasn't until I got home that I noticed she charged me for a ""large chocolate cannoli"" and not a ""large chocolate chip cookie"" even though she repeated back ""cookie."" The cannoli does cost more than the cookie so I was very upset with that. No one in this place has any sense of urgency. Everyone just kind of shuffles around slowly as if they didn't have a crowd outside of the door. When we sat down to eat our desserts I was desperately hoping they would at least be good enough to make all this worth it. But of course they weren't. All the desserts tasted like any other bakery. They weren't bad but weren't anything special either. If I wanted average food I would go to a regular bakery. The lobster tail was good, I'll give them that. But that's about the only good thing I have to say about it. All in all I would have to say I would never recommend this place to anyone.

I said no I didn't think it was necessary it should have been a given. The manager then states that the cake was in the same case as the other items. Nice way to justify the mistake made by her employee. I guess it was my fault going there in the first place.",negative,restaurant

Before paying, the gentleman showed us the boxes and asked if it looked correct, upon examining the items we informed him that the order was not correct. Another 20 minutes went by and finally the cashier called us over, I asked her what was inside the boxes and explained how the first time around the order was screwed up, her response to me was ""I don't know, read the receipt"" (how rude!!

I asked for a small round cake all white possibly a little pink and was told no problem they just need 24 hours so if we have time just come into the bakery when we arrive and we can work with them directly. We did just this and when we arrived were tole the best they could do is a week maybe 3 days or we could pick something out of the case. We asked to see the manager and were told they were not there. So we got stuck with an ugly cake with a brown bow and orange and green dots. They asked if we wanted anything written on it we said sure Congratulations and our names on the cake and they used blood red and it ran down the side of the cake looking like it was bleeding. When we did serve the cake we had nothing but snickers from our friends, the fontdant was so driy it cracked and fell off and the cake was dense and dryer than a pound cake. Basically ir was a bad cake from a bakery that just didn't care about the product it put out. When we called to complain no one ever called back. We emailed them and after several days got a vague email saying sorry send me a copy of your receipt. Then over a week later got another email saying sorry next time your in Vegas you can have 10% off anything in the store. BIG THANKS ruin my wedding and toss me a pathetic 10% off I SAY PASS THIS BY AND GET YOUR SWEETS FOR HOSTESS THEY WILL BE BETTER",negative,restaurant
163129,"Very dissapointed, work in the area so have walked by several times,the place always looks busy but actually its not. The counter help and cashiers are just super slow. There doesnt seem to be any real system to get the treats. I get the number system however its not working there. After my number was called and I placed my order my number was called again 15 minutes later,the guy asked what we wanted I told him we already placed an order,he started bad mouthing his co workers. Another seven minutes later our order was ready. So after waiting 22 minutes I got my cannoli and cream puff. Yup waited 22 minutes for trwo items that just had to be pulled out of the display case. The treats were ok nothing to write home about.",negative,restaurant
163134,I ordered a cake for my husbands 50th birthday 2 weeks before we flew out to Vegas and when I went to pick up the cake on the day we arrived they had no record of that order. They had no cakes available but could make me one for the next day pick up but it could not be a custom cake because they had to have 2 days pre-order. I already gave them 2 weeks!!!! The next day I picked up the very generic cake and had to sign in 2 places that basically no matter what the issue is I cannot get a refund. Now I know why they make you sign this because the cake was HORRIBLE. I thought I would be getting my husband this wonderful cake by the Buddy the Cake Boss and I have had better cakes at Costco. What a disappointment and waste of time and money. I should have ordered it from the Venetian hotel.,negative,restaurant
163136,"We were excited to be here. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. We waited 20 mins in line only to be told we needed to order at the case and then get in line. We along with several other guests went to order at the case only to wait another 10 mins and we got no help. No one approached us no one acknowledged us the employees were to busy chatting among one another and were more attentive to stocking the souvenirs. Several groups of guests left and as we were milling around the front one employee yells towards us ""I can help you now"" with such attitude as if she was doing me the favor. BUDDY you need to look at this team and have them take some guest service lessons....it stems from the mangement and flows downhill. If I was going to drop money on over priced desserts because of your Name. ...I'd rather not if getting treated like this",negative,restaurant
163146,"On a recent trip to Vegas, I was so excited to take my mother to Carlo's Bakery. I must say, we were underwhelmed, to say the least. Of the five employees working, we noted not a single smile. At best, they seemed bored and uninterested. That was disappointing. Then, there was the food. We ordered a brownie, red velvet cupcake and a cannoli. They didn't even have regular cannoli, so we got a chocolate chip cannoli. Not a single dessert impressed. They were all just average. We bought cupcakes from the grocery store bakery a few days later that we all agreed were better. Sad, sad experience. Maybe the Cake Boss has over-extended himself. . . .Is quantity having a negative impact on quality?",negative,restaurant
163154,"spent 60$ at this place and the best was the lobster tail ,the cupcakes were poor at best, dry and the buttercream was lacking to say the least , the cannoli were poor ,I was so looking forward to them ,the tart was ok but not worth going back for ,the eclairs were just poor no flavor , its assembly line has lost its home flavor, 2 stars only because of lobster tail.....sad what a waste of 60$",negative,restaurant
163184,"Finally got the chance to try Carlo's Bakery in Las Vegas. In the past, everytime I came by there was such a long line. I would not have the patience to wait. A couple of weeks ago, there was no line and bakery cases filled with lovely looking sweets. I asked the young lady what the two most popular items were, and I bought those. She recommended the Lobster Tail and the Cannolis. Well, I was underwhelmed with both of them. I've tried these items quite a bit on the East Coast. Carlo's versions were decent, but not nearly as great as I thought they would be. Was especially disappointed with the Cannoli. It did not taste fresh at all. The shell tasted old and stale. I'd return again to try more of their goodies if there was no line. Not worth it to me to stand in a long line based on this one experience. Hoping for good results next time.",negative,restaurant
163185,"Called to inform after placing a $65 order that items were missing after leaving the LV strip. Person who answered phone was incredibly rude, wouldn't tell me her name and asked repeated what she was supposed to do about it, got an attitude and then hung up on me. My purpose for calling was to inform them that it seemed someone wasn't paying attention when orders were packaged and told her that. She grunted. Being in the customer service industry myself, this response was extremely rude and unprofessional and puts Carlo's Bakery to shame.",negative,restaurant
163219,"Honestly, thanks you are cannolis! Isn't that what you're known for? Consistency was dry and hard. It was not good to say the least.",negative,restaurant
163220,"It was mediocre at best. The chocolate cake tasted very dry, reminded me of a little Debbie devils food cake. We also got a vanilla cookie nothing to write home about. The sugar cookie tasted like the Christmas cookies in a tin from my childhood . We wanted to be fans but sadly no dice! I have two stars because the employees were so very nice and helpful!",negative,restaurant
163230,"Ehhhhh. This place is very expensive, but everyone knows that. A cannoli and lobster tail was a little under $12. The cannoli was alright. The shell was a bit hard and there was a TON of filling. Way too much. It tasted fine. The hazelnut lobster tail was nasty. I don't know what the hell that filling is, but it was so bitter. Chewing the outside was exhausting. It made my jaw hurt. I ended up throwing it away. I only gave it two stars because customer service was good. Everyone there was very friendly and prompt.",negative,restaurant
163232,I got 2 cake slices from the cake vending machine-one chocolate and one red velvet. Awful cake. The chocolate was so sweet and hardly chocolate flavored even though it looks very chocolaty. I couldn't even eat half of the slice. The red velvet was barely better but the cream cheese frosting did taste ok. I was expecting a high end cake slice since he's the Cake Boss. Nope-cheap low quality. Tastes like shortening type frosting. A cake mix or grocery store would have been better. Don't waste your money.,negative,restaurant
163255,"Went here today, St Josephs Day, and the staff informed me that they MEVER HEARD OF ST JOSEPHS PASTRY. Don't call yourself an Italian bakery. Your not.",negative,restaurant
163260,I was looking forward to trying this bakery for a very long time! The sweets created by Buddy and his crew on their television show have always made my mouth water. What I found out here was that these two items cost $22+ and were just as flavorful as ones I could have grabbed at Whole Foods or the grocery store. They were decent but not $22 worthy.,negative,restaurant
163274,I'm a big fan of the show so we were excited to try this place since we are guests here in the hotel For the weekend but we found this in our rainbow fudge cake slice. Very disappointed & disgusted. The counter clerk was not friendly at all seemed bothered when we asked a question. I probably will not make a purchase again from any of their locations but still a fan of show & buddy of course.,negative,restaurant
163291,My cheesecake had a giant curly hair in it and so did my replacement cheesecake. I also ordered a danish that had hair in it. Pastries were good but clear health issues. Would avoid.,negative,restaurant
163315,Start off I saw the slice cakes in the vending machine in the Harrahs casino in the lobby.The cost for a slice cake is $9.00. I told my husband let's just go to the bakery so I can see the bakery myself . It's cute more selection is nice. I got myself 2 cupcakes 1 chocolate fudge and 1vanilla cupcake with white icing. That cost $7. and some change. I made a statement to the cashier wow for $7.they must be good cupcakes Smh that was the sign because he didn't even say anything. Shoot I got back to my room just to eat a stale cupcake. If you in the Las Vegas area this is not your spot unless you want high end Stale Cupcakes. That is a shame I am wondering if the slice cakes in the machine are past due date and stale too.,negative,restaurant
163317,"TERRIBLE!!! I'm hoping Buddy sees this. I was so excited to try his bakery without the flight east. Everything looked awesome, but then we took a bite. We tried the rainbow cake, and I'm sorry, but I could make a better tasting frosting with my eyes closed. It was so gross. But we continued on to the ""famous lobster tail"". I didn't know it would be like eating an actual lobster tail. It was hard and EXTREMELY chewy. It truly was disgusting and inedible. Next we had the cannoli and third time the charm? I'll say it was better than the other two, but nothing I'd buy again. How did he get famous with horrible deserts? I'll never know. I'm ready for Buddy to prove me wrong.",negative,restaurant
163373,If you're expecting something amazing please don't go prices are steep and the quality just isn't there. My wife wanted to try it since she's a fan of cake boss and we where both extremely disappointed,negative,restaurant
163417,"My family and I made a quick stop. Staff was very friendly, but the pastries were bad! I spent $80! $80! I got boxes of pastries. I was expecting something delicious and all I got were stale and HARD lobster tails, and cannolis that tasted like stale toaster strudel, the raspberry cookies tasted like any other raspberry cookie. Nothing tasted like it was freshly made.",negative,restaurant
163452,"I came here with my best friend who had always wanted to try the desserts here. The place is really cute and everything looks so good. That's where the positives stop. I ordered the strawberry shortcake and the rainbow cake. I paid 19 bucks and some change and while I wasn't too thrilled about how thin the slices were, I wasn't upset either since. When I bit into the strawberry shortcake, I was hit with this chemical-like, bitter taste. The cake was dry but would dissolve into my mouth into a sludge like consistency. I thought it was me because I was eating it in my hotel room after having dinner and assumed it was my taste buds clashing. After several bites and the flavor not getting any better, I had my best friend try my cake. She gagged. I thought that maybe they might have missed an important ingredient when making the cake so I immediately tried the rainbow cake. The batter tasted bad like the first cake and the icing tasted like the icing one makes when they mix that sugary powder that comes in a gingerbread making kit with water- not horrible but also not high end or worth the money. We tried the confetti cake my friend bought and it was the same thing. I will say, it wasn't as horrible as the cakes I ordered but still not worth the hype. I'm honestly really confused as to how this business has gotten so much positive attention when the cakes aren't edible. I'm definitely curious about the lobster tail and cannoli since that's what everyone on here has recommended. Maybe if I had gotten that, my review would be more positive. I'm definitely not willing to chance it though if I'm ever staying at the Venetian again.",negative,restaurant
163477,We bought cupcakes from the bakery in Vegas twice and both times they where stale and old no freshness at all . Every time I have come to Vegas and bought a cupcake it's been like that . Not worth the price for old cupcakes .,negative,restaurant
163487,"Buddy, for ffs, extricate your head from your ass and fix this place up! Have spent around $75.00 per visit at this location for the past three years based upon the Lobster Tail pastry being excellent and then rounding it out with some dark chocolate mousse cake and maybe some cannoli, even though they sort of suck compared to anything I ever had on the East coast. So, picked up four Lobster Tails, a hazlenut Lobster Tail, a dark chocolate mousse cake and a chocolate mousse cheesecake for my wife on 1/20/17. This was gonna be epic! Except, the Lobster tails were flat....as in the puff pastry never puffed....nasty, chewy, awful pastry experience. If this was my pastry shop, whoever ran the product that day would disappear in the desert, or at least be fired, depending upon how passionate the proprietor was about quality product, but hey, what do I care? I got a ""free"" Carlo's Bakery water bottle because I spent enough......areyoukiddinme? Very sad, but was informed by the recipients that the dark chocolate mousse cake was still delicious.....in a previous experience, the Lobster Tail was one of the top five pastries I have ever had in life, growing up on the East coast, that is a bold statement, and I own it, but not with this one, it was total crap and expensive. Buddy? Come on....wake up and own it or close it up and move on!!!!!",negative,restaurant
163508,"Don't get the big deal. The almond croissant bore no resemblance to a croissant. Was a doughy undercooked chunk of bread loaded w overwhelming almond paste. Are fans of the tv show really thinking this is what an almond croissant is? The cupcake was good, and the dark chocolate mousse tart was ok. Very sweet. Only reason to come here was the cannoli which was excellent.",negative,restaurant
163516,"well known for their cakes and pastries, but what s disappointing experience. The line was long and just when you reach to make your order; they get your order completely wrong. It was too long of a line plus too long on waiting for my order. Everything was sealed and package nicely, but to my horror it was not what I had ordered. Very disappointed that I could not taste what I had wanted.",negative,restaurant
163533,"I was SO excited to FINALLY get to try something from Carlo's! I have been a fan of Cake Boss for as long as I can remember and was always SO jealous of the constant line of people that got to go and try it out. Everything always looks so good! I was in Las Vegas this past weekend and remembered they opened one there inside the Venetian! I couldn't wait! I had to try a cannoli! The rest of the items I just picked out as I saw them. I purchased 4 items and it was just under $18! I didn't care about the price at that point. Here is what we got and what we thought of it... Cannoli- Honestly, I think the cannoli was the best one I've tasted so far. I don't get them a lot, but this one was good! Hazelnut Cream Puff- Nope! This one ended up in the trash unfortunately. It was disgusting. I hate to say it, but it tasted like disappointment. It had a very strange taste to it and the hazelnut was very faint and subtle. That was a waste of money. Vanilla Cupcake- I always find cupcakes made at fancy bakery's to be completely gross. I don't know what it is but they seem to taste like wallpaper glue and people LOVE them! I don't get it. This was no different. I can't really describe what it tasted like, but it was not what cake/frosting should taste like. Salted Caramel Eclair- This one was for a friend so I didn't get to taste it, but he said it was ""just ok"". Overall I was disappointed and felt like I could take that $18 and throw it in the trash. I'm glad I finally got to try it, but will not return again. I hate to say it but store bought cupcakes are better than Buddy's. Maybe New York taste is different than here on the West coast because they have been in business for so long, but I didn't care for any of it. We have a grocery store chain here that used to carry a few of his cakes. They were shipped in. I remember buying one and not liking it then, but I was really hoping that buying fresh from the bakery itself would be different. I know it's hard to pass up trying for yourself. I wouldn't have, but trust me, save yourself the money on this one. Such a bummer.",negative,restaurant
163544,"I was honestly disappointed. Maybe I set my expectations high because it's Buddy, but the pastries were expensive. I got the strawberry cheesecake and lobster tail and they were ok. The lobster tail was hard and crunchy. While the strawberry cheesecake tasted like the ones that you buy at the grocery store.",negative,restaurant
163546,"C'mon, it's the CAKE BOSS!!! That AUTOMATICALLY leads to high expectations! One of the few shows our family watched together cuz Buddy and Crew are FUNNY and had some good family fun and creativity! So, we just HAD TO sink our chops into the yummies offered at their shop in The Venetian, despite the overwhelming negative reviews on yelp. It's THE CAKE BOSS!!! Could it REALLY be THAT bad?!?! It's actually a challenge to find it for first timers. It's in its own alcove right across from Buddy's Ristorante, NOT in the main area of The Shops At The Venetian, but rather at the Las Vegas Blvd. entrance on The Palazzo side, next level up from street level. We came on a Saturday early afternoon and it took 27min to get out of the line and into the bakery, then 21 min to walk out with the goods. GEEZO!!! Longest time I've ever spent in a bakery. We indulged our sweet tooths to a few things. The LOBSTER TAIL? Yummy! Nicely crunchy & flaky with a perfect amount of cream filling. The Large CANNOLI and Large CHOCOLATE-COVERED CANNOLI? Unfortunately, this specialty item was disappointing. The shell didn't taste crispy fresh, the filling wasn't as creamy as I've had and a little too sweet. The chocolate covering masked the staleness of the cannoli shell, so I liked that one better. The RED VELVET CUPCAKE? Sadly, I've had better here,too. Tasted a few days old, and not very moist. So, it took forever to complete ""the process."" We interacted with our order taker THREE times, once to take our order, once to show us what she put in the box, then finally to pay for it. 21 min. to get already made goods?!?! Way too long. Most of what we ordered we've had better quality elsewhere, AND we paid a pretty penny for almost nothing worth the cost. Buddy, ya let us down :(",negative,restaurant
163548,"If you are looking for baked goods similar to your local grocery chain look no further. Service is excellent and the staff all helpful with recommendations and attentiveness. I appreciate the care all the staff give to patrons, but unfortunately I didn't stop by for the service, rather the food. The croissants are not worth the space they occupy in the belly. I tried both regular and almond, both bland, boring and unsatisfying. I left disappointed and waited the following day to hit Bouchon for a tasty almond croissant. If Bouchon is open, I'd suggest going there for pastries.",negative,restaurant
163561,"Update: To gain a better understanding of why the baked goods we purchased at Carlo's Bake Shop were stale and dried out, I visited this shop again, just a few minutes before they closed for the evening, to confirm my understanding of their business practices. Lo and behold, at closing time, the shelves in Carlo's Bake Shop were nearly full of baked goods that had not been sold off that day, and there was no ""closing time"" discount as is the practice at other fine, fresh bakeries. As the shop closed, items were still being sold at full price - and as they closed the doors for the evening, the shelves were left full of items to dry out over night and lose their fresh taste and texture! Shame on the owners of this establishment for permitting day-old items to be sold the next day to unsuspecting customers! Given the exorbitant prices charged at this property, isn't it reasonable to assume that one is buying goods that were baked fresh the same day? Fine bakeries treat goods left overnight as ""day old"" - if these items are not sold off at a discount before closing, or simply discarded, they remove those goods from their main shelves to be sold on special discount shelves elsewhere in the shop. No such practice is used at Carlo's Bake Shop, where you are provided a selection of old items mixed in with new, and it's the luck-of-the-draw whether you are getting a fresh item when you shop here. As for the many five-star reviews listed here, a charitable explanation would be that these are customers who don't know any better. But I find it hard to believe so many of these reviewers have never been in a fine French bakery that only sells fresh-baked goods. It's not as if there aren't a number of fresh bakeries in the Las Vegas area (and in many other cities), so I'm baffled by the large number of positive reviews for this shop. Still not recommended.",negative,restaurant
163570,"Omg, this was the worst cupcake I've ever had, it was dry and crumby like powder. It must have been DAYS old. Shame on Carlos for his lack of attention of this bakery. Gordon Ramsey would not have put up with serving crap.",negative,restaurant
163580,I've watched Cake Boss for YEARS Been a fan for a long time- so naturally anytime I'm in Vegas (or any city that has a Carlo's Bakery) I stop in for some goodies.. I usually get a few lobster tails because they are to die for. But this last trip I got 2 lobster tails and a slice of the rainbow cake- SO disappointed- the lobster tail had shrunk in size dramatically and it was still frozen in the middle and tasted freezer burnt as well. The cake was so flavorless and dull- the texture isn't even that good. All in all- I'm just disappointed.,negative,restaurant
163602,I was so excited to try this place but my entire experience was brought down by one employee. He was so rude and unwelcoming. He wouldn't even answer our questions when we needed clarification. I wasn't able to get his name because they don't have name tags. He wasn't able to hear me through my mask so he looked at me with a stank face and continued to speak to us with a negative attitude. So mean and unprofessional. I would have rather gone elsewhere if I had known about the poor service.,negative,restaurant
163727,The place was beautifully decorated but that's about where my stars end. The cake wasn't bad but ones we tried weren't very good and there weren't a lot of options. I got sweet potato with a mocha icing. I love sweet potato and it was basically a dense sweet potato loaf. The icing was a really thick cream like you could peel the whole layer of icing off at once. They both tasted okay on their own but didn't go very well together and both were too heavy for my tastes. My boyfriend got chocolate cake with chocolate icing and it was okay but just kind of meh. Nothing to write home about. I might've given it 3 stars except there was also a high pitched buzzing noise inside that was giving me a headache. No reason to go back.,negative,restaurant
163830,"Just picked up a cake I ordered for my girlfriends birthday. It was supposed to be a white cake with a toasted buttercream icing, but it was the most odd cake I've ever had. Let's start with the high points; the icing was AMAZING and it was decorated beautifully. Now the low...As soon as we took our first bite we both said it tastes like shrimp. Yes, shrimp. I have no idea what in the world would make a cake taste like that, but it does...it's inedible. It smells odd too and completely crumbles apart. I had such high hopes but was completely disappointed. I might try again in the future, but not anytime soon.",negative,restaurant
163869,"Well typically we are pleased with this place but today not so much. The girl that took our order was completely unfriendly and rude, and the two pieces of cake I got to go were dinky and crumbled into pieces. For about $5 each that sucks.",negative,restaurant
163909,"I have been here 3 times and each time was an unfriendly experience. The girl with dark hair and glasses is the rudest person I have ever been in contact with. Miserable, would describe her best, she should not work with the general public. Lawrenceville is a great community with some pretty awesome local businesses. Please don't support this bakery, they are not appreciative of your business, and will likely treat you like an inconvenience for even stepping foot into the Butterwood. Also, the cake is overpriced and really doesn't taste that good.",negative,restaurant
163928,"Thumbs down. Highly overrated! Went there with my date and had a piece of cake. It took very long to be served and when we got our cake I was very disappointed. The cake was *very dry* like stale bread on the bottom, like it had been sitting out for a long time on the plate or something, despite being told it was freshly cut. And the overall quality of the cake was sub-par/ not a treat to enjoy. Also, because of the other reviews raving about this spot as a cake spot, I was very disappointed in the selection of cakes, only a handful (4 or 5) to choose from. One slice will set you back about $7-8 dollars (with a tip.. $6.50 each) which is fine if it tasted good. But no. Cake should not be dry flavorless bread. Don't serve stale stuff. It leaves a bad taste in your customer's mouth (literally -- no one likes to be ripped off). Underwhelming experience. Also, a suggestion for an actual menu either on paper or posted somewhere, so customers can get an idea of the types of beverages the place offers would help. Needs improvements in quality of service, selections, and quality of the products.",negative,restaurant
163945,"Coffee was fine both the decaf and the regular. We had lavender with pistachio cake and chocolate cake. Both were made days ago, I think, they were not fresh and both taste similarly!

163972,"I'm new in town and I love ice cream. I was excited to try this place because of the great reviews. I ordered a QT of Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel as well as the pineapple Sundae to go. The Sundae looked great, but when I got to the vanilla IceCream, it lacked the ""Vanilla"" and sugar, and tasted like creamy milk. I thought maybe I got a bad badge of vanilla IceCream. But when I finally tried the Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel....both were underwhelming as well. All the IceCream I ordered lacked sugar and how they're supposed to taste. The Black Cherry tasted just like the vanilla IceCream but with cherries and reddish food coloring and the chocolate malt was also lacking ""something"". I'm glad I tried this place, but I won't be back sadly. I gave it two stars because of how long I waited in line and how much I spent. It was edible and wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.",negative,restaurant

I wanted to pick up some ice cream but before driving 35 minutes to get there I thought I'd give them a call to see if I could do a pick up or at least to see if the flavor I wanted was in stock. they were out on my last trip so I don't want to make an hour long round trip for nothing.

The ""owner"" years ago told me it only has to clumps of sugar when he makes it as the ""kids"" don't make it right. So, I decide to call and ask for him to give him my opinion on the failed GCS... I get another person In charge who tells me oh it's the supply chain shortage. I am thinking hmmm brown sugar is in low supply ?!! Sugar?! Needless to say the 2 she made me were still lacking . Basically, you get one of three kind of GCS - 1. Solid plain ice cream no brown sugar/ Graham crackers I assume and no black balls. 2. Solid ice cream with several black balls and zero brown sugar / Graham. 3. Tiny bit of brown sugar / Graham and some black balls. All of the above is so lackluster! You new people do not know what you are actually missing when it is made right and that has just never going to happen! Too bad, but also I don't need to get fat so keep making it poorly and use the excuse of the shortage when you were making it crappy years before pandemic and supply chain ! Ha",negative,restaurant
164028,The ice cream is amazing but the customer service is awful. They have no idea how to move a line quickly. You wind up waiting a ridiculous amount of time compared to the other Handel's and other ice cream stores around.

The same staff member that takes your order and money goes to the dipping case to scoop your ice cream without washing his hands or wearing a pair of gloves. At best, this is not sanitary and worst they could be spreading COVID-19. We all know that money is filthy and we should wash our hands after handling it.

164197,"Very disappointed! I love this place so much and come on a weekly basis, and have never had an experience like we had tonight. I'm 9 months pregnant, and we were out celebrating our wedding anniversary so we wanted to go to our favorite ice cream spot as a night cap. We arrived at 9:30pm with a small wait, which was expected on a Friday night! But what I was not expecting was how unfriendly the worker was towards us. We happened upon an unpleasant and displeased employee right from when we walked up to the window on the very far right, which was by 9:50. I asked 2 questions to clarify, and all he seemed was irritated and kept closing the door on our faces like he was dismissing us. I ended up just ordering 2 quarts to go because I felt so uncomfortable, and just wanted to leave. My husband encouraged me to speak up because I was wanting to try something new, so I tried to order one additional thing by the time he even got back to us (which was at 10:01). He rolled his eyes and denied me service because ""I wasn't allowed to order it once they were closed."" ...Even with other people still in line, ordering what I had tried to add on to my order. Maybe if he wasn't so rude from the beginning, I would have actually been able to enjoy my anniversary dessert but this completely dampened the night and put a bad taste in mouth because of the customer service.",negative,restaurant

164260,"Ice cream here is slightly above average, but every other aspect of this experience isn't. There could be one person in front of you in line ordering a scoop and you will still wait 20 minutes. This place is always understaffed and the service is unfriendly. I would suggest putting a larger menu in front of the glass so those in line could make their decision while they wait. Not worth it.",negative,restaurant
164282,"I eat at Handel's almost everyday, I get salted caramel in a sugar cone which is delicious! I have to say if it wasn't so good or there was another one closer I would stop going to this one. Salted Caramel is a really soft ice cream, I would think for $4.00 a scoop they could give you a cup on top especially when it is 108 outside. They want to charge .25 extra. How much could a cup cost .01. Terrible owner, not nice.",negative,restaurant
164288,"This place has the worst customer service!!! The little ""blond"" child is so rude. My wife was ordering an ice cream sand which and when the girl asked what type of ice cream she'd like in. She has to repeat herself and then the blonde kid said ""Do you speak English"" You wanna talk trash about your customers do it behind the closed glass jerks!!!",negative,restaurant
164295,"We've seen people standing in line for several months at this place. We always wanted to go see what the fuss was all about...and after ordering the much anticipated a common Brownie Sundae and Blondie Sundae we quickly realized there was no difference between Handles and DQ. If you're willing to spend $13 on a couple of average sundaes, We recommend you run into Smiths and grab yourself some Haagen-Daza (real ice cream) and make your own. It just wasn't that good!!",negative,restaurant
164610,"Ice cream is good but not worth the wait. Everytime my husband and I go, there is a line of about ten people and one maybe two employees working. This evening sealed the deal that we will not be going back. This is the third time we stepped out of line to grab ice cream elsewhere. This makes me sad only because I worked at the one in Ohio when I was in high school. On summer nights we had every window open with limited line waits. Customer service is something this location may want to think about improving. Gotta spend the money to make the money.",negative,restaurant
164614,"The ice cream is good, but the service is terrible. We were in the area and decided to pick-up 2 quarts (cocount cream pie and oreo). The problem is that we had to wait 20 minutes to get our order, for a line that was 6 deep and 3 guys working behind the counter. If you decide to go, you can have my space in line we won't be back.",negative,restaurant
164664,"The pastries are delicious but not enough to make up for the awful service.

164807,"On Saturday 7th 2022, I stopped in about 1 - 2PM to get coffee with my sister and mother who are from out of town. The line was nearly out the door and we looked at each other questioning if waiting would be worth our time. I looked around at the fun dÃ©cor and told my family Amelie's is a Charlotte small business worth the experience. It took about twenty minutes to get to the counter which we understood given it was your opening weekend in my neighborhood. The person at the register was kind and helped us order our coffee. They explained if we want pastries, then we can pay at the end after we select them. People behind us had not ordered coffee so naturally they walked around us to order pastries. As we walked in their direction they apologized and said they weren't sure what to do. We said it was no matter and that they should go ahead. We both stood there for several minutes while no one helped or acknowledged us even though we had already paid, our drinks were getting cold, and we had waited in line nearly half an hour. Up until this point, everything was acceptable. Next, an employee directed guests from behind all of us to select pastries. I addressed her and inquired if we could go ahead and she dismissed us that someone would be right with us. I interposed and asked to be told what the categorical difference was between them and those already in line. I asked if they had a different point of origination in the line or if there was some other significant criteria because if not I ask that we be served in order. At this point she told me to hurry up and pick something out since,"" I'm making a big deal about it"". I approached the counter and said I'm not making a big deal out of it and she interrupted me and said something along the lines of,"" are you going to tell me what you want or keep wasting everyone's time?"" I said since I'm wasting time let me just ask to see the manager. She replied she is the manager. I asked for her name. My sister asked if someone else can serve us and I simply walked away. Put simply, at the time I begin my transaction - I'm not wasting anyone's time because I waited fairly like everyone else. Disneyland doesn't rush people through rides faster because they wait in line longer. That would be absurd and bad for business. In fact, they find ways to make the wait more entertaining by putting beautiful flowers all around the guests and have themed characters visiting with children. Amelie's is the opposite of Disneyland. There is no magic there. There are so many other places in NoDa and Greater Charlotte that will treat me with respect. Rest assured, I'll never be back and I'll definitely be sharing this experience with those I care about. I can't imagine who would condone that type of communication in a manager and I hope no one else has to be subjected to that disdain and scorn.",negative,restaurant
164812,"Cinnamon Cherie def doesn't look like the picture. Plus cold. Plus had to be remade. Sad because i first came here and it was wonderful, today i brought my sister visiting from Miami and was embarrassed. Not only was everything slow, the drinks were cold, her same drink for here was given in a Togo cup. We asked for our croissants warmed and that was not to the servers liking. Just uncomfortable experience today.",negative,restaurant
164828,"Honestly, Amelie's owner- management team needs to visit: Kings Bakery - Ziggys -- for baguettes - great rolls for sandwiches, brioche buns and of course, Caramel Patisserie in Salem, Mass and./or take a trip to SFO Chantal Guillon 's and Tartine, in Seattle's La Parisienne, or Ken Bakery, Nuvrei, Baker and Spice, Jinju, Little T, in Portland, Oregon. Ahh! those who truly know how to replicate France's refined pastry shops Amelie might have created fame, been great at one point... now days it is filthy, in need or a great revamp, cleaning and dusting with indifferent staff who must ingest a strong coffee before they open the doors; they are simply indifferent to the point of arrogance. Southern hospitality it is not, FRESH superb pastries are lacking, , good sandwiches NOT at all 1st with Covid ALL areas are to be clean - disinfected - sanitized at least! 2nd Simple hygiene - dusting is necessary to remove all bacteria and germs 3rd Donate your day-old food - do not serve it to your paying guests in the am, this is uncalled for!

164839,"Surely I thought t the long wait in line would reward me with exceptional pastries, sandwich & drink. Not! The mixed berry fruit tart was subpar. My turkey & cranberry sandwich hardly had any sauce or cheese. It didn't even look appetizing. Our hot drinks were just as gio good as Starbucks. Very disappointed for the money I spent.",negative,restaurant
164869,Worst visit in 8 years. Nothing in the cabinet and very behind. Amelie's has always had bins full and plenty of backup. Not sure what happened but what a wasteful trip.,negative,restaurant
164878,"Not the pastry, they have the best products ever. We love to go once in a while myself my wife and my two kids. It's about the lady at the cash register, I feel she just downgraded us every time we are there, I think because my wife wears a muslim scarf, she does not go the extra mile to help us like she does with every customer in the line. Today again we had the same bad attitude towards us. That's why I decided to write this review. I have more things to say but I'll stop here.",negative,restaurant
164896,Visiting my sister out of state and reading so many great reviews about this place I was SO excited to grab some goodies with my sisters and niece. However while waiting in line from afar my sister was aggressively shouted out about the mask she was wearing. She was wearing a face shield from her nose below. Had she known she was wearing a face covering that wasn't up to standard she would have immediately corrected the issue. Instead she willingly stepped outside while I continued to order. At that time I let the cashier know how rude and inappropriate her approach was and had we known from the beginning it wouldn't have been a problem. She then let me know employees had been tested positive and they had to be shut down. That's no excuse for poor customer service. Once leaving the cafe we called to get her name which is Terry and she hung up the phone several times once asking to speak with the manager. Hopefully the food tastes better than the employees attitude.,negative,restaurant
164936,"I have always loved the NoDa Amelie's, so I hate to write a bad review. I drove across town for food. After waiting in line, I got to the register around 9:30. Closing was at 10. The cashier told me ""no food because we've already closed the kitchen."" My order didn't require any preparation aside from heating it up and putting it in a box. I asked to take it cold, figuring I'd heat it up at home. The cashier refused again. Shutting down the kitchen early is lazy, and I doubt the owner would be thrilled about the lost profits. If you're going to cut corners so that you can leave 10 minutes earlier, at least be willing to work with customers.",negative,restaurant
164956,"I have had very mixed experiences with this place but it is the only food french inspired bakery, despite the horrendous decor. 90% of the time I come, the line takes at least 15 minutes, because they only have ONE person on the register who is also packing the pastries. Not only that but if you manage to get to the front of the line and order, your food will take 20 minutes to get (I ordered a sandwich). Twice now, I've had an awful experience with two of the employees, when I was ordering and they gave me attitude. If you don't like working in customer service then find another job?? Idk what to tell you. I only gave it two stars because I like the sandwich I get, but these experience make me think twice of coming here.",negative,restaurant
164962,"In my annual visit to Amelie's, they once again failed on my order. Every.single.time. Kathleen took my order. Waited in a long line, ordered soup, a half ham and gruyere tartin, and a bottle of water to go plus a $2 tip. Got the bottle of water, but the food never came. People before me and after me got their food, drinks and bakery items. 30 minutes later I asked for a refund. Got the refund for the food, but of course she didn't offer to refund the tip.

165105,"I requested for a mixed berry tart to be warmed up. In the past the servers advise that they normally don't warm it up but they gladly assist with my request. The manager refused to warm it up this time because it ""falls apart"". I advised that I was the customer and that I was willing to take the chance because the tart has never fallen apart and that it wasn't an issue if it did. The manager refused once more and showed no type of interest in keeping my business. Very disappointing experience at this location and with the current staff for a simple request. I wouldn't recommend this location. Needless to say I didn't purchase the tart.",negative,restaurant
165119,The drip coffee is pretty good. The chia latte is wonderful according to my wife. The salted caramel brownie is terrific. The attitude we received when we ordered SUCKED! :( My coffee was a 1/4 empty. I asked for it to be topped off and the snotty girl still didn't fill it up. If it were gas station coffee and were cheap it would not be a big deal. However when you drop over $15 and you're treated like your inconviencing an employee it's unacceptable.,negative,restaurant
165121,"Bad experience! I went in with a few friends and ordered the three cinnamon pull apart breads, asked to have it heated up - it was not heated up to par. It was warm on the outside, but cold inside (just like my ex-gf), the glaze was like a jolly rancher feel. We asked for them to reheat it and they refused to take it back ""once it left the counter"" we would have to purchase another one..... totally not the way to run a business",negative,restaurant

The people who work here feel like they are entitled to something on top of everything being super overpriced. Not sure why but they have such a bad attitude. I asked for two coffees and they gave them to me in to go cups, whatever you guys do I don't care but I politely said that I didn't need the lids because I was having the coffee there (my bad for trying to reduce the plastic consumption) the barista gave me the worst look making me feel bad for saying no to the lids.

I am told, this is a 'fwench bakewy' and the most desired dessert is not within the walls of this cluttered palace of Knick knacks and oddly positioned tables. My head hangs dejectedly.

165488,Kudos to AmÃ©lie's for furnishing their bakery with purchases from the Habitat Restore. I ordered chocolate bread pudding and it came out simultaneously burnt and cold - the outside was charred and the inside was cold. From the little that I tasted I could tell that actually reheating it properly wouldn't make it much better. Employee kindly gave me a refund. My boyfriend enjoyed his chocolate croissant but I didn't care for his chocolate cake/mousse dessert. Would come back to try lunch sandwiches and a salted caramel brownie.,negative,restaurant
165504,"I'm just going to be really honest for those who won't be... I hate this place. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Everyone I know LOVES it because they think it's SO tastefully decorated and that the food is delectable. But I'm here to tell you all that it's simply not. The first time I visited AmÃ©lie's, I had to try very hard not to cringe when I saw all the French, ""vintage"" garbage adorning the hideous, obnoxiously colored walls. Everyone I go with always comments on how cute and ""aesthetically pleasing"" it is but I could not disagree more. Thinking that the food would make up for it, I continued in and picked out a macaron and a raspberry tart. I was very disappointed because both desserts tasted bland and lifeless. I have since been back multiple times and have yet to find a dessert that is even remotely worth the money. I have a friend who makes macrons that taste 100x better than AmÃ©lie's do. I'm tired of people begging to come here and suggesting it as a hang out 95% of the time. N.C. needs to step up its coffee/dessert shop game because this is clearly missing the mark. Don't waste your money.",negative,restaurant

Grungy environment, dirty tables and floors, staff was rude (when we got to checkout we decided to add one more pastry and the employee gave attitude).

I will be trying the new petit macaron shop next time.",negative,restaurant

165663,"OK, this is my first visit here and to be honest I was not really impressed. First the area around the bakery is a scary area of town. it is absolutely horrible with train tracks and worn down buildings and homes. I have been told that NODA is a hipster central but I really do not see it that way. it is not swanky at all and its pretty close to central avenue in appearance. As far as the bakery goes we had Chesse croissonts, apple turnovers and regular croissants and it was just OK. There was nothing out of the ordinary with regards to the food we ordered. we had a major problem with the lady at the counter as she was giving our order just cold and when I asked her "" Are you not going to warm it for us"" she retorted ""Oh you want this warmed up"" as if a cold Croissaont tastes so much better than a warm one.. Duh.. Also all our food was served by the server in 1 plate when the order taker knew it was for two and a second empty plate had to be requested.. The seating here is also limited and it feels very congested as one of the tables next to the ordering counter are in the way of people standing in line to order their food. Overall not a pleasant expereince from all the congestion, lack of good service from the questions etc and we were not at all impressed.. Since we live in the North side of town we would certainly not return to this worn down area of town to eat in this not so impressive bakery..",negative,restaurant

Arrogant service people, groups of people that hang out for hours on end, long lines that can last up to 45 minutes, and lack of parking coupled with the scandal over employee pay have taken the lustre off what was a unique spot in Charlotte. The treats are still amazing, but I hate actually going.",negative,restaurant
165697,"Long lines for over-priced, gross tasting below-average food that taste just like Panera. I asked for my sandwich to be wrapped in lettuce, (keeping it healthy) but they never heard of that before, they told me- so I was given a plate of unwashed field greens with a slice of slimy deli turkey thrown on top. Not to mention I asked for the vinaigrette dressing and they literally gave me half a tablespoon full...my husband commented that it looked as if they reused it from another customer. They were out of all the featured sides as well. Grossness Does not even begin to cover the nasty tasting food. Yuck. I left hungry! My husband had the Brie and roast beef sandwich. He said the one tiny slice of Brie was good, there was 1 slice of roast beef in the sandwich which did not even cover the length of the bread. He said he would never go back also. The desserts did not taste fresh either. Overpriced food which tastes disgusting! Terrible service, long lines!

I know and love French people and could not fathom the misguided decor disaster, which I found offensive rather than a funky American take on French style. The paintings were not ""improved,"" rather, I felt they were vandalized. Aside from aesthetics, I was not a fan of the ambiance either. It must appeal to many people as this place has franchised. The chocolate croissant was edible but seemed to be frozen and baked on site rather than fresh. Disappointing overall.",negative,restaurant

Just help everyone in line patiently and with the best humor you can muster.

Ambiance & Atmosphere: kitschy bordering on trying too hard, noisy, & the layout leaves the ordering line blocking the display cases so it can be difficult to have time to shop the offerings when the counter help is asking for your order right when you first see the contents du jour.

The employees at this location are some of the rudest bunch I have encountered. When I arrived, there were no labels on any pastries and after asking to be helped we said that we were waiting for them to be labeled, they did not offer to tell us what they were. When they finally began to label after 5 minutes, we asked what kind of cake they had and two of the employees got into an argument about one not knowing what kind it was. While continue looking, three employees congregated up front to talk very loudly and poorly about one of their fellow employees and her work ethic. After finally getting up to the register and asking about their two blends of coffee, the employee was very rude and unhelpful, all I had asked was what kind of roast and its strength, she laughed and said ""I don't know"", so I ordered two of the same kind and she had asked if I wanted any room for cream or sugar and I politely and simply said ""No thank you"", I then hear her make a remark of ""Of course not"" to another employee and they both laugh. After finding a place to sit I realize the weight of my coffee seems very light and disproportionate to the size I got, so I decided to pop open the lid, low and behold there is almost 2 inches of room in each of the coffees I had ordered. I had immediately became disgruntled and walked back up to the counter and caught glares from the woman who rung me up and poured my coffee and 2 others like I had done something wrong, I calmly took off both kids and proceeded to show and explain that I had asked for no room and received the exact opposite, the helping employees offers to fill them up and realized they had run out from that brewer, but she immediately brought one up after that was fresh and proceed to fill up my two cups, only to still leave room. There was no apology made at any point, I was no rude to them and did not saying anything to aggravate them either.

166366,"I always wanted to go to the Amelie's since I study French and I'm obsessed with French culture and cuisine.Last year I went to study abroad in France and let me tell you that ""Amelie's"" is a bakery, but definitely not FRENCH bakery. Have you ever had french macarons? or napoleon cake? Their products may look like the original French but they are not. I went there today specifically to treat my bf and myself with nice French deserts. At first, I couldn't even bite the macaron, that's how hard it was! it was not fresh, had weird coloring. for example, pistachio macaron usually has mint color or light green. Here is was toxic bright green, and didn't have the same taste. The food did not smell nice, it had some kind of artificial smell. Moreover, the cake itself was not macaron at all, it only looked like one. The chocolate ""macaron"" was simply a sticky kind of brownie instead of two pieces of meringue with soft ganache inside. The napoleon was made from frozen parts of cream and only thin slice of pastry, and basically looked and tasted like cheap frozen pies that you can buy from Bi-lo or Harris teeter(even groceries have better frozen cakes). Napoleon is not even supposed to be frozen! It tasted like an ice-cream, and felt like an ice-cream. I don't mind ice-cream at all, but they false advertised it as a regular napoleon cake. I've tried several deserts and returned them, and fortunately cashier issued me a refund. However, I will not come back. If you want to try traditional macarons go to the Earth Fare or Cafe Monte. P.S. the interior is nice, "" a la francais"", but you can put little copies of Eiffel Tower everywhere and it still not going to make it a French cafe/patisserie/restaurant if the food served there is not French and not fresh. The personnel had no idea about what they were selling, the guy whom I questioned had to go to the backdoor 4(!) times to answer do they use traditional recipes or not and if the pastry they sell was made according to the French recipes.",negative,restaurant
166385,"Ok....Ok....I know this review will not be favored amongst other yelpers. I'm not a huge fan of Amelie's. One night, my boyfriend and I decided to hop in here on a dreary Saturday night after being in the Plaza Midwood area. I was in search of a latte and he had a sweet tooth. While the line was about 8 people deep, it moved rather quick. I've since learned that this number of patrons was an anomaly as the line is usually wrapped around the room. Anyways, we tried the Salted Caramel Brownie that EVERYONE loves, a few Tortes and a strawberry croissant. First off, they did not want to make a latte....not at all. I don't blame them, it was not that good. I don't think I was able to finish all of it. We were not impressed with the brownie either, it was just a thick chunk of caramel plopped on top of a dry brownie. Maybe we got a bad batch or something but it was not the ""raved"" about dessert that I was hoping for. I had the same problem with their layered tortes....dry and not flavorful. The croissant was....not the warm, buttery pastry that you would envision. I would love to love Amelie's but I just don't. I DO like the fact that it's open 24hrs. and I find it a good place to sit and people watch. I plan on returning for a third time to try it once more, have a plain coffee and sit to work on some writing.",negative,restaurant

Having said that, I live extremely close to amelies and have visited the bakery several times when friends and family are around. On my visits I do politely ask if there are any vegan options that they offer and usually I get a friendly no,... however the last time I went the person behind the counter was so utterly rude about it it makes me not want to visit this place. I understand my dietary needs are a choice and by no means to I expect everyone to conform to them, but I don't think it's appropriate when a suggestive question is posed that they be rude about it. I'm just sayin! ;) In other news... if you know of any places that have vegan dessert options (other than zizis) lemme know, as I've got a wicked sweet tooth!!!",negative,restaurant

166586,"I came here today for breakfast hoping to get some of their delicious quiche but they were out. Instead I got a sausage egg and cheddar sandwich on a croissant. I was informed it was 75 cents extra for them to scramble the egg, which I thought was pretty ridiculous. The total cost of my sandwich and small coffee was almost 8 dollars which is quite a bit more than what I pay at other places around town. When I got my sandwich it was pretty small and the croissant was so dry that when I bit into it it fell apart into flakes on the plate and was impossible to eat. Very disappointed in this experience overall. I did mention this to one of the workers and he did offer to get me something else so that is appreciated but I think they need to make a few changes with their breakfast sandwiches.",negative,restaurant
166651,"I usually do not write reviews, but after having the experience I had with this company, i just had to share. Amelies's is one of the most unprofessional companies I have ever seen. Let me explain why. I am having a wedding this August, so my fiancÃ© contacted the company asking about wedding cakes. The email reply she received was very vague, and stating that we need to pay $15 to receive a tasting box. We could have a consultation after receiving the box. They did not tell my fiance' that we can not pay at the store. So my fiancÃ© wrote them back an email saying they should have told her that she could not pay at the store to receive the cake. They went on to make her feel like she was the one at fault and that she should have already known that they only take payment over the phone with a card for the tasting box. How are your customers supposed to know this information if you do not tell them?? If we can not pay at the store, then you should probably tell us this in the initial email. So after we pay for the cake sample box, we go to the store to pick it up and then after trying the cake, my fiance' wrote them another email to set up a consultation. So they only do consultations during normal business hours, which is fine. It is now Tuesday and we told Betonya that we could meet Friday after 2p and she emailed us back setting the meeting time at 3p. So we get to the store at 3p and ask for Betonya, The gentleman behind the counter goes to the back and comes back up front saying that she was not there today. We told him she set a meeting for us at 3p. He was nice and went back to find out what was going on. He came back and said that she was not feeling well so she is not here today. So did Betonya not find the courtesy to let us know that she was not going to be in today, or at least let someone know that we are coming? We live 45 minutes away from the store and to come to an appointment set by the company and then being stood up is very unprofessional. After telling the gentleman that we drove 45 minutes to get there and she had set the date and time, he went back again and came out with two ladies. They were going to do the consultation for us but said they would have to relay the information we talked about to Betonya before letting us know anything. We did the consultation with them and left. My major concern is the unprofessionalism displayed by Betonya by not informing her customers that she set a time up with that she would need to reschedule. Very disappointed with this experience. For this reason, I will not return, and will tell everyone I know about this awful experience.",negative,restaurant
166659,"I was pointed in the direction of Amelie's by a classmate who seemed to be a fan of the breakfast sandwiches, which he said were usually sold out if you don't get there early enough. I figured this was a sign that it was a good cafe/bakery. The first couple times I went, I bought an assortment of pastries to try - most were pretty great. I had given some to my parents to taste and my mother insisted her birthday cake come from there (I live 90 minutes away so this wasn't exactly easy planning.) On my next trip I purchased several french macarons and after getting them home, discovered a small hair sandwiched into 1 of them. I emailed Amelie's through facebook to explain what happened just to let them know someone needed to be a little more careful. I received an email back from Lynn profusely apologizing (including the same formatted apologies I've seen from her in response to some reviews on here) and offering to make up for the mishap. She gave me a separate email address to contact her with additional information. I emailed her back at the address she provided and told her I didn't want anything for free (I assumed the apology and promise to check their procedures was sincere) - and only wanted some help picking out a birthday cake for my mom as I was short on time. I never received any response. I followed up a few days later on facebook to see if she got my email and again, no response. I sent a 3rd and final email December 26th (3 months after the fact) and finally got a response 8 days later apologizing for dropping the ball and offering a gift card to make up for it. I received another email this morning because she forgot to copy the gift card person on what happened. Really? This is a comedy of errors that just isn't all that funny so I won't be back.",negative,restaurant

I was actually hoping to try Thomas Keller's variation on the Oreo, but they were completely sold out, so I instead went with the old standby of an almond croissant. It certainly looked the part; it was covered in almond slivers and dusted with icing sugar. But one bite let me know that things had gone very, very awry somewhere along the line. Basically, the thing was hard as a rock. I couldn't even bite through it with my front teeth. I had to break off a piece and gnaw on it with my molars. Not exactly what you're looking for in a croissant. The middle section was a little better, as underneath the rock-hard exterior was a filling that was pretty tasty. But getting there required a Herculean feat of chewing.",negative,restaurant

167030,"This location in Las Vegas is not up to par to the one in NYC. The 2 stars is for service and quality of the macaron and croissant. First, it was obvious I was next in line and the counter girl took the guy behind me. There were 3 other workers milling around; either inside the kitchen or doing inventory. None of them acknowledged me even with my irritated face. Finally one of the workers asked what I wanted. The macaron was cold; meaning it was not fresh. I also got the almond croissant; if I've known this before hand I would've never wasted my money. Again, it was not fresh; it was dry and lacked almond cream filling. The vanilla macaron that I usually get at Bouchon's in Columbus Circle is so fresh, decadent and service is great! If Thomas Keller knew about the quality of the products that they're serving here, he would be appalled! Two wrongs will never make a right! Service sucks and so do their products. Shame on you!",negative,restaurant

We found it on Yelp, but got lost trying to find it. Bouchon offers a small variety of baked goods ranging from cookies to yogurt parfaits and cute macarons. We didn't order any of the baked goods but ordered a coffee and a hot chocolate. The drinks weren't anything spectacular; they scored below average for me. The hot chocolate was made out of milk but it tasted funcky. For Bouchon, I expected chocolate decadence, but I got none of that. The only good thing about the drink was the temperature because it was chilly and I depended on it to keep warm.",negative,restaurant

I settled on my favorite flavor, pistachio, and ordered a chocolate chip cookie as well. The macaroon was overly sweet. To me it tasted like an Andes mint flavored macaroon, so maybe they use mint for color? There was only a subtle hint of pistachio. I was completely disappointed. The macaroons in the freezer section at Walmart are 10 times better. The chocolate chip cookie was okay. The chocolate chips were fantastic, but the cookie was just average. Definitely not something I'd go back for. If you're on the Strip, there are far better options that are more deserving of your money and caloric intake. Skip this one!",negative,restaurant

We arrived and was gravely disappointed because the storefront resembled a kiosk, not unlike how a Starbucks is nestled at the local Target. We didn't know what to expect but we were def bummed out. They don't really have a dining area reserved exclusively for the bakery. We had to find a spot at the food court 30 yards away. We ordered latte and chocolate croissants.

We had butter croissants and almond croissants, and they were all stale and awful. They seemed to be day old at least. We have not only been to Bouchon Bakery many times in California, but we have also eaten at Bouchon Bistro in Yountville for various special occasions.

167431,"First: Please note that many people are reviewing the restaurant NOT the bakery. My review is for the bakery. I have been coming here for years, but I am extremely sad to report that my last two visits have revealed that they just don't care any more. They seem content to just coast on their laurels selling this stuff to rubes and foreigners The coffee is good, but the pastry is where they need to re-focus. First, the biggest offender is their Macarons. They served us a nasty hateful hard lump of a cookie last week. This thing was seriously rock hard. They are supposed to be crispy with a slightly softer interior. That is the WHOLE POINT of the cookie. When we complained they said ""that is the way they are supposed to be, and the softer ones are old"" No, no, they are not. You overcooked the crap out of these which formed, essentially, a meringue. I have eaten Macrons across the world and made them myself. I was in Paris a few month ago and took down a half dozen of these from Laduree. I am pretty familiar with this stupid little cookie because my wife loves them. Do not insult me by telling me this hammer-substitute is in any way acceptable. They told us to take it up with the downstairs location if we did not like it and refused to refund or exchange the cookie. Astounding. The rest of the menu items have just gone downhill. Their croissants are all but indistinguishable from the stuff they sling at buffets. The outside should be flakey and the inside tender. Not some glupey congealed mess. You know how I know its a terrible croissant? There was absolutely no flakes to clean up. I hope Dominique Ansel opens a location and shows you guys whats up.",negative,restaurant
167442,"Anyone who says Bouchon has great macarons clearly does not know anything about macarons. I consider myself somewhat of a macaron connoisseur, having discovered them while living in Paris a few years ago. The macarons at Bouchon are horrible. They are overly big, too dense and chewy, and over-refrigerated. They were not fresh or delicate at all. Not even holding them to the lofty standard of Pierre HermÃ© or LadurÃ©e, they still pale in comparison to other places in NYC, San Fran, and Vancouver. We usually sit and savor every last crumb, but at Bouchon, we didn't even want to finish them. It was a chore. And way overpriced. The only reason it gets two stars is because the TKO (like an adult Oreo cookie) was good.",negative,restaurant

With much hesitation he finally agreed. This is going to be a short review but definitely to the point. 1. Chocolate Eclair: ugh. Disgusting. The chocolate filling was too bitter and it left that ""made yesterday"" taste. Which it probably was. 2. Macaron: I'm sorry, but macarons are not suppose to be more chewy than a stick of gum. And it was chewy. I lost faith in Bouchon's macarons here. I thought they may blow LaDuree or even 'Lette macarons out of the water but they did not. Even my husband (who's not big into sweets) even thought 'Lette macarons were good. 3. Carrot Cake Cookie: didn't taste bad, but I'd still settle for the Trader Joe's Karat cake. Will I come back? Most likely not. I don't think it's worth it. Thank goodness the restaurant is a whole other thing.",negative,restaurant

We had vanilla and pistachio macarons and some other small pastry. Macarons were hard on the outside and the filling was cloying- they'd been sitting for too long, perhaps?

It was about 45-50 minutes,,, so naturally I was expecting some really top notch food to be coming. In fact, I was really counting on having some gourmet waffles this particular morning! Well, would you believe it, this place actually ran out of waffles!!! How do you run out of waffles? Sure, perhaps a restaurant could run out of frozen Lego waffles, but I would expect THIS restaurant to be making their own fresh waffles- which you should NEVER run out of! Unbelievable... it's just flour, eggs, sugar, milk... not much required! I got no excuses, just ""we're out"". Okaaaay... well, after I got over the fact they ran out of waffles, I ordered some really basic pouched eggs (which I expected to arrive in front of me tout de suite). Nope, I was once again extremely disappointed!!! Delivery of our basic food order was incredibly slow - making our whole experience at Bouchon a huge time waster during an otherwise beautiful morning. Solution? Well, for the rest of our stay at the Venetian we boycotted Bouchon and had some great fast and delicious breakfast meals at the Food Court... which is the place to go if you don't want the hassles you might be subjected to at Bouchon.

My friends who were standing behind me thought I was going to blow a fuse on her based on the attitude I received but I decided to keep my composure this time.

I love ganache so I couldn't wait to try it. Meh. It tasted like an oreo but 10 times more expensive. At least I ate that. Then I had 2 macaroons. Very gelatinous in texture.

However, I was a little disappointed with my visit here. I decided on the red velvet cupcake and a caramel macchiato. For $3.50, the cupcake was a good deal for it was the size of a muffin! Most cupcakes I've had are for the same price but pretty dinky in size. The frosting wasn't overly sweet and the red velvet was nice and moist. It was a tad bit doughy though, but nonetheless pretty good. The coffee however, is where things start going downhill. Maybe I came on a bad day or maybe it was a new worker, but I've had caramel macchiato before at various coffee places and never had I had one like this. For $5 I got their smallest size and when I picked up my cup, I was surprised at how light my cup was compared to the other girls that ordered other Lattes and such. I opened my cup and found it to be filled halfway with foam, barely any coffee so I asked the barista if it was the correct order. He just kept saying that that's how it's suppose to be. It didn't seem right, but in any case, I didn't make a scene about it. $5 for half a cup of bitter coffee and foam is not well worth it! They also have a few other things there like sandwiches and such, but all were a bit pricey. Expected I suppose since it is Vegas.",negative,restaurant

169543,"Since my initial review, I've been contacted, through Yelp, by someone who I originally believed to be a devoted fan or a company shill. Since she didn't review Sweet Republic, I believed she might be the latter. However, after being asked two times to no longer contact me (and being blocked on TWO separate accounts), she contacted me AGAIN through a third Yelp account. This third time, she included information in her message that could only be obtained through a website other than Yelp. Yelp management has been contacted. However, no action has been taken to date. Reading their Terms of Service (""TOS""), Yelp states that stalking is prohibited. But, these same TOS say that Yelp is under no obligation to enforce their TOS. Fans are cool; stalkers are not. Understandably, Sweet Republic has fans who are devoted. However, if you write a critical review of this business, you may be confronted by a stalker. It's so cute!! I have a stalker!!

169681,"Let's be honest, ALL ice cream is GOOD ice cream....I can't think of a time I've ever had a bad scoop. After reading all the reviews of this place, I did have high hopes - assuming it would at least be as good as any store bought stuff...but presumably better. I had my flavor picked out before I even got there....dreaming of the salted carmel goodness gave me chills! Once I got there, I ended up trying a few different flavors, because I didn't want to miss out on anything. I tried the salted carmel, which seemed ok.....I thought maybe I just got a hold of a little tasting spoon that didn't have alot of salt or carmel in it.....decided to get a scoop anyway, assuming there would be alot more flavor once I really got into it. I ordered a scoop of creamy coconut without trying it for my fiance. And I also tried the almond brittle - which tasted very similar to the salted carmel....sort of vanilla-y with a hint of carmel or something sweet and then some almonds. Decided to get a scoop to go. Also tried the honey lavendar which was a little too peculiar for me - tasted like a scoop of sweet pachouli. Interesting..not my style. After getting home with all my ice cream, I let me mom and fiance try them. No one seemed particularly impressed...including myself. I've had better ice cream from the store....and evidently this is considered 'gelato'....which it is not. Not by a long shot. Ice cream or gelato, this didn't make my top ten list. After sitting in our fridge (3 tiny scoops) for a few days - we only finished off the almond brittle and the others are still there. I believe I'll end up throwing them out, b/c I'd hate to waste the calories on it! I've NEVER thrown out ice cream before. And I don't want to imply it's terrible....it's just sub par......not very interesting, even though the flavor combos would have you think so. I wish I could give it a better review :(",negative,restaurant

169695,"Bad news SR has been hit with the ghostly, unsolvable ""sulfur / egg / sewer / hair salon"" stink that attacks all Scottsdale businesses that don't complain to the city. I swear there's a valve the city opens and closes to push the odor to the next business when the previous one complains. I've smelled it from Frank Lloyd Wright to Shea. Make no mistake about it, when you walk in it smells putrid. Service - Older lady working all alone that can only do one thing at a time complaining about how her arm is going to get a good workout today. Slow to say the least and theres hardly anyone in here. Ice Cream - Delicious, original, something that sort of makes the comments above worth it. Please, remove that funky air you got up in there.",negative,restaurant

I guess if you're a ""foodie"" and want to tell your friends Porschea and Chad that you just had Salmon Tartare and saffron ice cream and it was ""Just Faaabulous "" this is the spot for you. Exotic flavors aside let's talk about the product which is ""ice cream"" it tasted ""watery"" and bland, not creamy and rich like a premium homemade ice cream should. The scoops are small and over priced given the quality of the ice cream. Side note I bought an oatmeal cookie which ""looked"" amazing, but didn't have much flavor and had a bitter after taste (threw 3/4 of it away). If you looking for a good ice cream fix try the turtle sundae at Culver's, but be warned Chad and Porchea won't be impressed.",negative,restaurant
169789,"Visiting Phoenix and noted the rave reviews on this place, so decided to try this on our way back to our hotel. When we came at around 8:30 PM on Friday night, there was only one other couple in front of us so we were served pretty quickly Service: Only 2 people working. We were greeted immediately when we walked in, but I got the feeling that I was supposed to have known what I wanted at that time. The employee who helped us was not super friendly, but maybe it had been a long shift or...? Ice cream: My husband got the TC^2 and the salted caramel, and I got the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon. I also sampled the honey blue cheese and the sugar and spice. I didn't get much of the almond flavor out of the almond buttercrunch, but the other flavors were alright. The texture was not great - kind of icy, not very creamy for all the hype around this place. Pricing: Reasonable. If one is in the area and wants ice cream with ""original"" flavors for a decent price, might stop in. Otherwise, I would not recommend going out of one's way for the ice cream here. All-in-all my husband and I were non-plused (we're also spoiled by some really great ice cream in the SF bay area).",negative,restaurant
169877,"I don't understand the hype here at all honestly. I understand Woo! Better for you ice cream! But it's STILL ice cream. Okay ice cream at that. Maybe I am just used to the ""artificial"" flavors but I've definitely tasted better ice cream elsewhere. And if I had known I was gonna spend $10 for okay ice cream, I would of just said screw it and went and got some frozen yogurt from Yogurtland that's half the price of this place. The customer service wasnt there at all either, I think it would of hurt the girl if she had smiled. Sorry Sweet Republic, I definitely will NOT be back.",negative,restaurant
170112,"Well....this is a very time consuming process, one ice cream server moving at a minimum wage pace is a real buzz kill. Either way at the cupcake counter or the ice cream counter it's questionable. Oh wait there's two lines huh? No but ah...were together so can you serve us both? The elder couple ahead of me gave up allowing me to advance...yea. The server was pleasant and helpful, no question but it was slow and saving on labor cost was evident for the day. What was cool was the outside order door. Think dumb waiter with a two way speaker, whatever. Your better off getting a popsicle at the liquor store around the corner. food guy-martin",negative,restaurant
170148,"Mehhh, nothing to write home about. Truly basic flavors with a great concept. It was reasonably priced and had seating outside, along with limited seat inside.

170191,"The cupcake trend is gone but this chain is still going strong and just opened at The Linq. Thought I'd try a place recommended by quite a few SoCal Yelpers. Did not expect to be as disappointed as I was. Tiny space leaves little room for a line, menu is large and not easy to read at a distance, save for the list of flavors and cute colorful caketopper symbols indicating which flavors are currently available. Service is a trainwreck. Even busy, this place doesn't need 6 people behind the counter, their ordering and fulfillment process makes no sense. Made it to counter, placed order for one single dark chocolate cupcake, plated to eat on location. My name was taken and I was told someone would be with me in a minute. I'm not sure why the same guy couldn't just reach into the case next to us and hand me the cupcake. Paying for my order was hectic. Girl misprounced my name to get my attention, gave me correct flavor, on a plate, with no fork. After handing me plate, asked for my card. Awkwardly set it down, retrieved card, then had to reach again for my ID- for a four dollar purchase, after waiting nearly 10 minutes. Really? Finally snagged a seat to eat. Cupcake frosting was good. Cake itself was dry. Just because I ordered at 9PM should make no difference to the quality of your product. Cake texture and frosting texture didn't really work well together, due to the extreme dryness of the cake and the hardened frosting topping. Opted for a cake without sprinkles, wanting to get the cute circle symbol instead. When I ate it, I nearly chipped a tooth. Given the low quality cupcake received dining in while they were still open (and busy), I'm hesitant to try the cupcake ATM. Can't imagine they retain their moisture well in what must essentially be a refrigerator. Sprinkles, you have a great brand and clever marketing facilitating your business in an amazing new and highly-trafficked area. Step up your game in the kitchen and train your employees on efficiency!",negative,restaurant

170347,Horrible.. this place is very understaffed for the type of traffic they have..set up is so bad from order to pick up...cant say how it tastes because I have been waiting for 30 min to get my order..feel bad for the employees to have such a negligent owner.,negative,restaurant
170373,"A little overrated but still delicious. Their set up is a little confusing. They have two different doors, one side for cupcakes and the other, for ice cream. Every time I went, they had people standing outside, in attempt to answer questions/direct you into the right door. I like the concept but didn't like the execution. I was honestly a little intimidated. I felt like they were very nicely attacking me with flavor menus. It also felt a little awkward because I'm used to walking by a store front and going in on my own terms. I knew going to the Linq that Sprinkles was on my must try list but when I actually got there, I felt pressured to go in. Anyways, the ice cream is delicious. My first time there, they recommended the cookie ice cream sandwich. You order first, then wrap around to the other end, pay, and wait for the goods. While I was waiting, I couldn't help but notice there were flies landing on the cookies/brownies sitting in the window they had. I'm by no means a germaphobe but felt very disgusted. I kept watching the flies to make sure they didn't go near the cookies I chose; and honestly, in my mind, they probably already have... I just didn't wanna admit it. Everything is a bit overpriced here but I expected that. I'm not a HUGE fan of cupcakes. I only tried a couple bites from my friends. Pretty good but their frosting is a little sweet. Totally biased on my end though... Lost my sweet tooth years ago. I hope this review doesn't garner hate or offend anyone. I was turned off during my first visit with the whole fly thing but I have gone back twice since then (didn't notice any flies the last two times). I'm still a fan... just not super impressed.",negative,restaurant

After paying the $4.25, the little door opened and we got our cupcake. It was a regular sized cupcake and it had no frosting. It tasted like a great BASE for a yummy cupcake with other flavors and frosting, but alone it was just...cinnamon cake. Very disappointed. Not worth $4.25 or even what they charge in store.",negative,restaurant
170540,"Not the most exceptional cupcake we've ever had. They weren't light and fluffy like I would have expected, but rather thick and heavy with a sweeter frosting than I would desire. Overall, for what we spent I'd choose a different option the next time we visit.",negative,restaurant
170552,"With all the hype Sprinkles gets, my expectations were overpriced (I figured about 6 dollars per cupcake) but really tasty cupcakes. I was wrong on both accounts. We arrived and chose the cupcake line. There is a separate counter for ice cream and cookies. I was pleased the prices were reasonable. $3.00 for a cupcake is on par with less trendy shops. I was disappointed that they did not have most of the flavors which were listed on the wall. I settled on a raspberry cupcake as the sign said it was a seasonal favorite while my daughter ordered their specialty red velvet cupcake and we also tried their mini chocolate marshmallow for $2.00. The chocolate marshmallow cupcake was horrible. Neither my daughter nor I could finish it and it tasted like a rum based dark chocolate topping with a strong bitterness. The raspberry cupcake was overly sweet but definitely tasted like fresh raspberries were used in the making of the frosting. I could only handle a small bite of it due to the sweetness. Unfortunately the cupcake was not moist inside and rather crumbly. It tasted stale or store bought instead of handmade. The red velvet cupcake was only slightly moister but when I picked it up, the top came off and the cupcake fell to the ground. I am all for cupcake tops but this only happens with dry cupcakes. The flavor on the red velvet cupcake was good and this is the only one of the three I would ever try again.",negative,restaurant
170562,"Friendly service. The pretzel cookie was exactly how you'd expect it to taste - salty, crunchy, and pleasant to eat. For the service and cookie, this place gets a couple stars.

The cake itself was dry and the frosting tasted of sugar and diabetes. For a cinnamon cupcake I'd expect more zing.",negative,restaurant

I also got a kiddie sundae with red velvet ice cream and a mini dark chocolate cupcake. WHAT a disappointment! Here's a breakdown: Red Velvet: Cake is okay, but the frosting tastes like chip dip Mini Chocolate Marshmallow: Forgettable Lemon: Frosting is good, but the cake, which has no hint of lemon whatsoever tastes like a cross between a dry biscuit, a pancake and coffee cake. Awful. Vanilla Meets Chocolate: See lemon for cake.. Frosting too sweet. All you tastes is sugar Dark chocolate: Grab a cup of milk. Extremely dry and very bitter. You'll like it if you really love super dark chocolate. Red Velvet Ice Cream: Have you ever had an ice cream sandwich? One of the one's you get from the ice cream man. Well remove the ice cream in the middle and crumble and red velvet cupcake in it. Voila! Now you have Sprinkles Red Velvet ice cream. I won't attack the price for these.... concoctions because it is located on the strip. As a self-prolaimed cupcake connoisseur, I will say that this is the worst cupcake establishment in Vegas. It's even worse than Caked, which is hard to believe. I caution you to save your money.",negative,restaurant

Because I am unfamiliar with the area, I parked at the Caesars parking garage and walked to the cupcake shop. I select my cupcakes and hand my debit card to the cashier. She then asked to see my ID, I told her I don't have my ID , I left it in my rental... because the Sprinkles that I go to often to in Northern California or, the one I've visited in Beverly Hills a few times never asked for my ID. She then goes to ask a shift manager if she can accept my debit card. She comes back and says no she needs a photo ID of some sort.

Second complaint, tons of workers and only 2 people ahead of me yet it took over 15 mins to get them, the ice cream line was a bit better. Instead of doing a good job employees just kept apologizing for their screw ups. Cupcakes great as usual, will just use ATM from now on if I ever go to this one again.",negative,restaurant
170900,"I was excited to try their cupcakes after hearing all the rave reviews! Unfortunately, I was disappointed by what I tried. My wife and I bought 4 cupcakes in 4 different flavors. A red velvet, chocolate marshmallow, Dark Chocolate and another that I don't recall. On all 4 the cake was pretty dry and crumbly and not moist at all. The cake also lacked flavor and was really quite bland. The marshmallow cupcake had hardly any filling in it at all. The one saving grace was that the frostings were all pretty flavorful, but not enough to save the cupcake. I've had Georgetown Cupcakes, both shipped to my home and visited their location in Los Angeles and theirs are far better than Sprinkles'. To add insult to injury, they charge $3.75 per cupcake which is more than Georgetown. Overall they're overpriced for an inferior product.

We purchased 2 cupcakes that being the first and a salted Carmel one being the second. The salted Carmel was pretty good the cake was nice and soft but way over salted. The cheesecake one only had flavor in the frosting and it wasn't strawberry that's for sure. The girl helping people with the ice cream etc was very nice, friendly and outgoing. The girl at the counter who rang us up seemed like she might have been nice but kind of flighty. We got our cupcakes to go sit outside at the table since there was no where to sit at the inside. She put the cupcakes down on the counter in a box turned her back and that was it. Luckily I noticed next to the register was some wooden Popsicle stick looking thing which I hoped was a knife to cut the cakes in half and luckily it was.

170956,"Updating my review to this place because I went back with my boyfriend a second time. Although the girl working was really nice, I had noticed that there were no chocolate based flavors. For how many options they had, I thought that was a little crazy to not have a traditional chocolate flavor (or even a chocolate peanut butter or something). Biggest reason for the review change---Last time I rated this place, my boyfriend was the one making the purchase, so he paid. This time, we went for the special they have which adds a macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top of your ice cream. I thought the menu board said they were $10 each (which is too much money for what you get, in my opinion). I remember tipping on top of it. And then when I checked my bank statement the next day, it said I spent $28.24 here. Almost $30 for essentially two scoops of ice cream plus some toppings?! PASS! I don't think I'll come back here if these are their prices because their ice cream is not worth that much. Even had I tipped 20% (which I think I did), it should have been $25 (again too much....) so to randomly add an over $8 tip is outrageous for what you are getting. I'm not sure how that happened but I doubt I'd come back. If I do....someone else better be paying.",negative,restaurant
170959,"Was pretty thrown off by the location of this place, looked like a donut shop. My Icream wasn't that great- and the marshmallow was gross - and my 1/2 Macaroon got all burnt when they toasted the marshmallow. Won't be be back. Don't recommend",negative,restaurant
171008,"This place is just okay. Had a hard time finding it also (basically no signage). The flavors were kind of odd and didn't really sound appetizing.

171138,"I've visited this establishment on February 8, 2020, along with my three family members. We ordered three small ice cream cups, a large milkshake, and a small milkshake. The small milkshake cup was only half-full as it was the left-over amount from the container from making the large milkshake. I didn't mind too much that I was charged full-price for half a cup, but then we sat down to eat. The milkshakes were so watery that they couldn't really pass for a milkshake, but the store had become busy, so it wasn't worth going back and have her add more ice cream. At age 66, I can't recall having such a poorly made milkshake in my life. It was just watery milk with an ice cream taste. It was so blatantly obvious, so the only reasonable explanation is that she simply didn't care. Likewise, she wasn't friendly, and I didn't want to make a scene. The price of the order was $26.87, which was markedly high for the subpar quality of the product and crappy service. In summary, I won't be visiting this establishment ever again, and if you're looking for a nice ice cream shop in this area, you may want to look around for alternate choice.

I show up it's not 11 o'clock the time when it's supposed to close on a Saturday almost all the ice cream is put away and I'm awarded with a notation of sorry man I've already put everything away and I'm not going to make you ice cream. 10:52 the time it was when I got there is not closing time and as far as I am concerned in the service industry the customer is always right and it doesn't matter that you want to get out a little early. It's your job quite literally to wait until 11 to pack it up. I've been coming here since they've opened and have seen a slight bit steady decline in caring about the job every time. I'm sad to see my ice cream shop with the mallow on top I also understand you take the good with the bad so everyone is happy. Right now I'm not happy. I'm just glad my wife isn't pregnant this time. I guess next time I'll get it a 4 pm and wait till 11 to eat it. Thanks again Jeremy,negative,restaurant
171158,"Was extremely disappointed in this place. The gelato flavors were not unique and the texture was more on the watery side. I was hoping for a nice creamy texture but nope not here. I got the cookie cup of course because why not since that's what they are known for. Thought it was a little on the pricier side and the marshmallow was way too salty... did not expect that at all. So if you're not the type that likes sweet and salty, you're in for a huge shock like me. Pros: + you'll get a nice picture for instagram + the macaroon cookie was nice and chewy Cons: -parking was not the best -expensive - SALTY",negative,restaurant
171191,"Not impressed. Chocolate shake was watered down ice cream, and the cookies scoop was really sweet not flavorful. It was unique but not memorable. Wouldnt come back, and the location is TERRIBLE!",negative,restaurant
171294,"Bottom line..Customer service is great, icecream is terrible. The icecream was the worst i have ever had in my life. It had no flavor and was soo icy. it was basically ice. Tried different flavors and they all tasted very artificial. Very disappointed as i was excited to try this place. I think they have the macaroons and the marshmallow to mask the terrible ice that they are selling. I would not recommend it.",negative,restaurant
171325,I usually go to Creamistry for ice cream but decided to try something new. If I said I didn't regret it I would be lying. I sampled a few flavors and decided to get a scoop of mango sorbet. The sample was somehow misleading because as I tried to enjoy my sweet treat it just had an off-putting aftertaste that wouldn't allow me to do so. We also tried their boba tea which I wouldn't recommend either. I was excited to try this place because of the reviews but left underwhelmed. In my opinion it's overrated and I'll go back to my regular spots.,negative,restaurant
171343,"I went to Fatty Daddy's last year and loved it!! Good ice cream flavors and unique cookie cup. I went back this year with friends and was so disappointed! The cookie cup price didn't change but the lady said the ""menu changed"". I got two tiny scoops and one cookie instead of two. Once my friends saw how small the portions were they didn't order anything. The flavors weren't as good this time either. I don't plan on going back! I can get a DQ blizzard for half the price and triple the ice cream. Don't waste your money!!",negative,restaurant
171346,"Not the same as it used to be. Although the new owners were nice, it was very disappointing. I hadn't been in a few months (trying to eat better) and for the same price as the original fatty daddy I got a few tiny scoops of ice cream and one cookie. The original fatty daddy was so huge you could share it. I'm glad I got to experience the real thing when it first opened. I'm not sure I'll ever go back. Time to find a new ice cream joint.",negative,restaurant
171370,"My wife and I wanted to get some ice cream and so we hopped on to Yelp to find a place that we have not tried. We came across Fatty Daddy's and were convinced by the positive reviews so we decided to give it a try; however, we were not impressed. We were actually disappointed. It seems like most people go there for the macaroons and marshmallow ice cream sundaes?? (Maybe those are satisfying?) but we just got some ice cream. We both got a large cup with two different flavors. The disappointing thing was that they gave us two small scoops and then charged us almost $16. That's $4 per small scoop of ice cream. I could have purchased a tub of ice cream for $4. Over priced and the flavor is mediocre.",negative,restaurant
171373,Staff was polite and idea has a lot of potential but I wasn't impressed with the quality of ice cream.,negative,restaurant
171375,Best ice cream around. Had chocolate birthday cake with a red velvet macaroon and homemade marshmallow. Omg. I meant to give it 5 stars. Not one debbie,negative,restaurant
171380,"I would give this place zero stars but I didn't have that option. First of all, who pays $5 for a single scoop of ice cream?? When he rang me up with that scoop I literally thought I was paying for a free sample. Not worth my time or money. Never coming back.",negative,restaurant
171411,"This is the first time we've stopped in at Fatty Daddy's but based on the reviews and pictures, we were intrigued. The dessert with cookie and toasted marshmallow was the only ""special"" dessert item. They were out of most flavors and the one they had that we thought looked good was not. Chocolate Nutella was disappointing to the point that my wife and I threw it away. It's saying something if my wife throws away ice cream. We stopped at a gas station for a pint of Ben and Jerry's. It was much better. Again, though, our only time there and it was late. The staff was friendly.",negative,restaurant
171413,"Iced coffee was not good at all. Yelp says free wifi, the cashier said the wifi is not for customers. The ice cream in the displayed looked good at least. Don't think I will be returning.",negative,restaurant
171523,"Minus 1 star. Service was crappy, and Ice cream was even worse. For $7.50 we got horrible ice cream with soggy cereal, an extremely salty (yes salty?!) marshmallow, and a below average thin half of a cookie. Would never recommend.",negative,restaurant
171609,"Stingy cashier, they got a bad attitude. I ordered 20 pieces of bread and they shoved it in one small box and it all got crushed. If u want to go to 85 degrees I suggest going to a different location. The bread is only decent and it even worse that these poorly trained workers crush them into a box.",negative,restaurant
171632,Worst boba I had. The bread really aren't anything special except it's Taiwanese style. You can tell that they don't use real egg nor real butter. Super affordable place and that's about it for me,negative,restaurant
171646,I wanted to try out this place as it looks great. Yup it LOOKS great but it is not that great. Nice variety of items. You take a plateau and pick out what you would like to buy. Then wait in line. Seven people working (of what I see) yet the wait is pretty long and the line moves slow. I got 2 pastries that I heated up in the oven. They were very bland: mushroom one and the hot dog one. There's better spots I'd say...,negative,restaurant
171656,"No breads - just drinks We got the iced taro lavender latte with boba and mango strawberry smoothie with lychee jelly which were both wayyyy too sweet. For the taro lavender latte, I tasted absolutely no hints of lavender - just taro and sugar from the boba which I was pretty disappointed with. The mango strawberry smoothie had no reminiscent of mango and the lychee jelly just made it way too sweet. Although the toppings did make the drinks overly sweet, the drink itself did not match the description and I would not get again.",negative,restaurant
171682,"First time here and here's my first impression. The space is pretty big if you're wanting to hangout here or eat your bakery stuffs.. they have a wide selection of breads that it looks big and puffy but as soon as u bite into the bread it deflates.. so I'm thinking they just used a lot yeast to make it rise (I don't know. I don't bake) and the stuffing inside is not a lot either. They have cookies and pan bread... it's not that good either... they have teas and coffee to go with their bakery goods . So it's ok but I would suggest to just get your tea to the store next door called share tea. It's pretty good there... so the most disappointing part here is the waiting and the cleanliness part... when u get their bakery stuffs you have to get a tray and put ur own breads etc, they provide you with your own tongs. The price and the name of the bread are displayed! While holding the breads, bakery goods on ur tray you go to this long line to wait and pay while having your food exposed to cough, sneeze, air etc..there is no protection because they don't put plastic wraps until You get to the register where the money and all kinds of germs your food can get exposed to.. thee waiting in line to pay takes about 45 mins so if you're carrying your big tray with your goods depending on how heavy it could be it's really annoying... so when you get to the register the cashiers have to no conversation because they looked pretty beat up, taking payments, bagging the goods one by one and arranging them In a box. It's not very efficient.. and they are tired.the cashier I had said she hates it.. lol! I understand that they make their breads, goodies fresh but packing them already before putting them in the shelves is much more safer, cleaner and efficient if people loves their baked good they will buy them anyways, I'm sure they still make it fresh everyday because it will run out, some of the baked goods are gone and I can see them refilling them... so to save time, to save the food from Dirt packed them, and provide the clients a box so they can get in and get out.... and they also have to make sure the breads are filled and not just air inside... if it's gets better I might give it another chance but if not... I'm good. And I will not recommend it...",negative,restaurant
171686,"Very bad experience here! The store does not even reach its capacity, it was barely half of its. Unfortunately, they let people wait outside for nothing in the cold rain! A prudent people will let the same numbers of people in vs out, unfortunately the young lady guarding at the door didn't know how to handle the situation. We asked her why? She simply answered she was afraid of long lines, but looked in the picture ! This is not even defined as a regular ""long "" line that you should imagine. My gosh! Sorry Even in bigger city, things like that Never happened with other 85 locations which are even smaller in square feet. This store manager better know how to prepare for holiday seasons.",negative,restaurant
171774,"They technically close at 10pm today. It is currently 7:30 now. The picture is no exaggeration. I asked if they are still baking some pastries to make this visit worth it & we will wait. Unfortunately, they are not refilling the shelves anymore. Not sure if the opening last friday was a ""soft opening"" but this is just very disappointing. They hyped this place soo much and they should have prepared even better.",negative,restaurant
171809,"I was there at the grand opening at 9. got there around 8:00am and was one of the first 25 people . They had UNLV cheerleaders to cheer and had a great opening. The bread was nice and fresh. Respect for the managers to have crowd control and not let it look like a Hong Kong protest inside with people grabbing bread off the trays before they hit the shelf. They handled that pretty well. I got everything I could on my tray. two mugs and the yardstick for the first 100 customers. The above review is 5 stars worthy for the morning. the reason why I put a one star is for people who are curious and for the managers to look at how they did cause they care about the business and need customer feedback. I went back there at night because I gave most of the bread pastries away to my coworkers since we had a birthday celebration. I did not have a chance to try the matcha custard bread, milk pudding bun, the croquette bun. etc. I went back hoping there was still more at night. instead it was mostly subpar items like muffins and the egg tarts. None of the premium items I saw in the morning or mentioned above or the ones you see in the morning review posts. It was just pumping out the same bread and put it in three different places. I saw the berry tart like in three different shelves and muffins that anyone can go get at Starbucks. It was just selling bread at that point for profit since there was a demand there, but also because they probably ran out of ingredients for the other items. Here is the reason where they screwed up. Since the morning. it was pretty chaotic with all the excitement. I forgot to ask if the free yardstick was refillable or not. I heard the regional divisional manager say this is the first of its kind for Las Vegas since it has Vegas themes on the free items. I could not hear if he said ""free"" refills or "" no refills for the yardstick. I went back at night to ask and clarify. I asked three employees and they did not know. Till I asked the lady at the drink section kindly if it was free refill or not. The cashier next to her heard me and said in an angry tone. NO REFILL. then mumbled to her coworker "" they brought it up in the meeting."" the one I asked kindly went to her manager and asked and she came back and told me no without yelling No REFILL like the other cashier did. I accepted it since i wasnt sure due to all the noise in the morning. The one star is for the rude cashier at the front. All it takes is one thing to ruin the whole experience. the customers are the driving force for the business, but if they have cashiers not able to handle the customers, then people reading should be aware to expect it. Bread was perfect, grand opening was perfect. Ask a question and get an angry response from another employee and I am willing to spend the time to write this one star review. Do yourself a favor. Dont go there at night and grab the leftover inventory. Wait till the hype goes down and they train their employees to be nice and courteous to the customers.",negative,restaurant
171848,"I've been here twice and both times have been bad experiences. The first time I came, the pastry I got was old and hard. The second time I got a couple of pastries and shared them with a few other people and we all got food poisioning. I don't know if the bakers aren't being very clean when baking (i.e. not washing hands, or sneezing/coughing on baked goods) or if certain ingredients aren't being stored properly but something needs to be fixed.",negative,restaurant
171875,Severely understaffed or just badly managed. People lined up all the way to the door to pay and there's one person on the register. Staff doesn't seem to care. When I was there last people were shouting to have someone man the other registers. Sitting area is a mess since there's no one cleaning it. I know they've only been open a couple of months but that's enough time to figure out what needs fixing.,negative,restaurant
171901,"I bought some bakery and cake on 1/11 at 11am, and the male cashier on the left register is rude and nasty. He wore the same clear/plastic gloves when he gave me my changes back and pick up my cake, the bakery, forks and napkins at the same time for me. I told him to be considerate to customer's health when handling food during this Covid by replacing the gloves. Instead of admitting his mistake and apologized, he responded back ""the cake and bakery are covered in the store"", which meant he can reuse the same gloves to serve multiple times? Who knows how many customers he had been helping before my turn wearing the same gloves!!!!! These cheap clear plastic gloves suppose to be used once and disposable, beside all cakes and bakery in the store were not completed cover, they are open on top for the cake and the plastic cover the bakery were not complete sealed. In another word, he only wore the gloves just to protect himself and careless to the customers' concerns. The management here should train your employees to be serious with the pandemic, protect customer health and should be polite to customers. Remember that there are plenty of bakery stores in Las Vegas, with this kind of customer services attitudes, you will loose all your customers soon.",negative,restaurant
171953,"Truly a disappointing experience. Having been to many 85 locations in CA, I had high hopes that this location would be an amazing addition to my new hometown. I came on Sunday, 3/8/20 at about 5:30 pm. There was a long line but that didn't initially bother me. However, when you enter the store, the line for the checkout (staffed by one cashier) was wrapped around inside. The line was right thru the middle of the pastry selection area, making it difficult to make any selection for the few pastries that were out as the people in line wouldn't move, even after asking politely if you could reach around them to select a pastry. The young man at the checkout was pleasant and very apologetic for the wait. I assured him I knew it wasn't his fault. Inadequate staffing is a managers fault and I saw no manager assisting in the mess I saw occurring in that store. What disgusted me to no end was the employee working the coffee bar. His hair was unkept and long and sticking out everywhere. He seemed to have no feeling of any urgency to do his job, as he was wandering all over the store while people stood waiting for their drinks. He wandered several times to the back of the store behind the swinging doors and then would wander back to the coffee making area and never washed his hands. The part where I wanted to vomit was when he made the drink, then carried it over across the aisle with his hand over the top of the cup - now full with coffee (there is no assembly line format for making drinks so it's very disorganized). I know that a food handlers permit is required in CA so I'm going to assume that one is required in NV as well. All the things I saw with this last employee violate the health code. And with the world gone mad about the coronavirus, it would behoove this particular employee to take health precautions seriously or find other employment. I did not have him remake my drink (as I was late for an engagement). And didn't have time to wait another 30 mins for a drink. It found its way to the trash instead.",negative,restaurant
171954,"It would've been nice if 85 degree bakery opened in Vegas a decades ago around 2009, but since they waited too long, between all my trips to california and back in my home country, my excitement about this bakery already vanished by the time they opened one in Vegas. I finally had a chance to walk in for the first time today, why? because when they first opened, I always see there's a super long line, I do not want to waste my time waiting, so finally today, I see there's no line and I decided to walk in and check it out what's the hype, first of all, they don't even carry the most popular and most common bread ""Buttermilk Boroh Bun"", I couldn't find it so I decided to ask someone who worked at the store, I believe her name was Jasmine, here's how our conversation goes ""Excuse me, but do you....."", before I could even finish my sentence she said ""Sorry, but the tray will be out soon"", wow, is she a mind reader or something? except that wasn't even what I was going to ask her, I was just going to ask her if they have buttermilk bun, I did want to give her credit for apologizing though, but geez, we give you two month and this is the kind of customer service you provide? to just brush off customer with some ""common answers""? anyway, to my shock, she doesn't even know what buttermilk bun is (I was in shock, all ASIAN baker should know what that bread is, and just fyi, no it's not pineapple bun(stupid name they used in jj bakery), the right translation should be buttermilk bun. So that does it for me, the customer service just completely turned me off, I'm glad I only wasted 5 minutes of my time in there.",negative,restaurant
171970,"update: also interesting to note that nobody has reached out to me from this company to apologize. i was so hopeful when i walked in and saw the cute atmosphere and the flavors looked delicious. the girl who took our order though, was visibly disgusted by my ordering and paying for my two ice creams and a drip coffee that cost exactly 20.09 for some reason even though the ice cream was just like, a regular scoop. idk cool atmosphere but very bizarre vibes from the employees",negative,restaurant

And finally, the ice cream wasn't that good (birthday cake & Nutella) & melted once she scooped it onto the box container.",negative,restaurant
172028,Honestly overpriced for taste and presentation. Serving in a take out box with a fortune cookie is hella cute but so VERY inconvenient to eat out of. The paper box disintegrates (duh).

I wanted to try another flavor, but I didn't want to ruin this guy's night any more than I already had by asking to try a third. My friend also pointed out to me that there had been a fly in the mango sorbet while we were there and the guy had simply scooped it out. Other reviewers have said the ice cream was icy, but that hasn't been my experience. I enjoyed it enough to give it several tries, but it isn't worth the consistently awful service I've received here. The ice cream itself deserves 4 stars. They have good flavors that are fun, and it has a good consistency to it. However, even the best ice cream would be ruined by a dirty shop with flies and bad service.",negative,restaurant

172269,"This place is a small ice cream place with a lot of potential but from what I saw doesn't know they have that potential. I went there twice on my visit to Arizona first time got chocolate and fruity pebbles. Chocolate was great creamy and smooth with good flavor. Fruity pebbles tasted like it but too sweet and when u got a bite of pebbles it was soggy like they churned the ice cream with the pebbles in it instead of just folding them into the ice cream. This is just a preference for me. My first time there was 1 guy working register and counter and never smiled or really said a word. If you would ask for a sample it was like you just asked him for a million dollars and his house. Just not a friendly fellow, the second time we went there it was properly 45 minutes before closing so 10:15 which is still early in this town and they were open but had zero ice cream. Now the guy at the counter was sorry and seemed it. But still litterly the only thing they sell is ice cream and you run out?? Why and how? I appreciate they make it from scratch I used to too. But why only make enough for the day? Why not big batch's fresh ice cream has a shelf life of at least 4-5 days. So ice cream is good but if you run out of ice cream before you close you either need to close earlier or make more ice cream! That's why I had to give 2 stars",negative,restaurant

It's as if they took the same vanilla base - then added stuff to it. The giveaway to my hunch? The Salty Caramel. Salty? Yes. Caramel? Not really true caramel. The color of the ice cream was vanilla white. I don't believe it's possible to make any kind of caramel without some sort of brownish hue.

Second, while I was at the counter deciding on what donuts I wanted, a customer shoved by me to get to the register, saying ""Excuse you."" Also very rude. Third, I picked two donuts with vanilla icing and vanilla frosting. The employee gave me two donuts with maple frosting. I asked if the icing was vanilla, and she assured me it was vanilla. What if you are allergic to maple? You would get sick because of the employees lazy attitude. All in all, the employees are rude and not helpful, there is no flavor menu, and half of the donuts are not even fresh at 9am. I will not be coming back here again.

172628,"I'm totally disappointed Exterior/Location: Small red building in Cleveland's south side. Interior: red and white interior, bakery shelves and cases. Vibe/Ambiance: I was under the impression I would be eating the most fabulous doughnut ever. Staff: there were 2 people working at the time. An older women who was cleaning and a younger girl working the counter. The younger girl basically asked us if we wanted a dozen doughnuts. No enthusiasm or affect. I was even more confused because she was offering me a dozen of chocolate doughnuts, which was all that was left. Clientele: could be anyone. I saw young and older people pulling in after we left. Price: I don't know. I only bought 3 doughnuts. Must get items: Krispy Kreme doughnuts that are 6 miles away. Why I love or hate it: not a fan Final thoughts: this was a total disappointment. I drove out the this place after reading so much about it on Yelp. As a lover of doughnuts and an aficionado, I was so excited to try what I wanted to be the best doughnut ever. I walked in, greeted by a teenage girl who wanted to know if I wanted a dozen doughnuts. I looked at the cases and they were empty! How could the shelves be empty? It was 4:00 pm and this place is open until 8:00 pm. There was one small baking sheet left with only three kinds of doughnuts. I told her I would try one of each. My daughter and I eagerly ran to the car to eat our doughnuts. Upon first bite, I was annoyed....they were so average, I was embarrassed that I even drove out. My daughter and I decided that we would take a short ride to Krispy Kreme, a few miles away for what we found to be food nirvana. I don't need to come back to Jack Frosts. Totally not worth the calories.",negative,restaurant

172651,"I'll never understand what all the hype is about Jack Frost. I feel really bad for giving a negative review about such a historic local business, but they're just not that good. First off, they're cash-only, which is just utterly ridiculous in 2019 for a business with a storefront (i.e. non-mobile) location. Second, their donuts are extremely cosmetically appealing, but don't actually taste good, and are not very good quality. The dough itself is very bland and not sweet, and is always somewhat stiff and stale-tasting, no matter what time of day that you go. Their toppings are slightly below average taste-wise, and they are unfortunately notorious for NEVER putting filling in any of their donuts. They just put everything on top. This usually means that there's about half a teaspoon of ""filling"" sitting in the dimple on top the donut, with the rest of the stuff being just whipped cream or other toppings. This leads to their flavored donuts just tasting like crappy dough with only one or two bites where you can actually taste the intended flavor. Also, the donuts that they recently brought to the vending booth at the Cleveland Zoo's Asian Lantern Festival were even worse than the ones at the regular location. They were so stale that they were crunchy/crispy, despite being in a temperature-controlled case. That did not reflect well on their business at all, and I overheard numerous other people complaining while they were walking around and eating their donuts. Overall, I'm getting really tired of giving them chance after chance and always having the donuts suck every single time. If you want fancy donuts that are high-quality, just go to your local family-owned bakery instead. If you want cheap but high-quality dounuts quickly, then just go to Giant Eagle, Heinen's, or Drug Mart, who all have excellent donuts for great prices. There's absolutely no reason to go to Jack Frost with all the other (better) options that are around the Greater Cleveland area.",negative,restaurant
173047,Tonight I went to Jeni's (which I LOVE the ice cream) but I paid for a double(plus tip 10$ total) and got a single (2 bites of ice cream)...

Closed to prep for a special event. No sorrys, no coupons to come back and try it again. Just a hand-written note and no ice cream. How do you expect to earn customers when you randomly close with no notice? I understand you have special events but you should offer something to people trying to spend money at your ice cream shop during posted business hours.",negative,restaurant

Not sure if the Clevelanders who enjoy this are all acting, or if they are too intimidated by the name and reputation to divulge how this ice cream really tastes. Only tolerable thing is the frozen yogurt which is equally expensive but not as rich.",negative,restaurant
173879,"I hadn't been to Presti's in years, and now I remember why. The days of the pride that bakeries like Corbo's and Presti's use to have is long since over. All it takes is a few generations, and a lack of wanting to preserve something of value, and just general laziness, to ultimately lead to a businesses downfall. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and asked them to toast it in the toaster oven to heat it up. The outside seemed warm enough, but when I bit into it, the egg was luke-warm, and the sausage was cold. I asked if they could put it back in because it was still cold; the reply was ""not after it has crossed the other side of the counter."" Seriously? She said, oh well you can use the microwave... Sure I could, if I want to have a soggy mess!!! If you are going to sell pre-made breakfast sandwiches, expect your customers to ask to have them heated up. Or better yet, take some PRIDE in your work, and make them fresh!!!! I should have demanded my money back. I will NOT be going back. Customer service is LAST on their list",negative,restaurant

I told her no, I didn't want any discounts, just asked her to please watch her attitude it effects us all during the holidays, her condescending response was 'my patronage will be missed' when I asked to speak with the manager the clerks all laughed.

I stopped in for a breakfast sandwich and was let down...three types of sandwiches to choice from already made in the case. Was disappointed when they took my sandwich out of the case and heated it up in a microwave...I mean each to their own but I don't know about you but I'm not a fan of microwaved bacon and eggs. Was hoping for a fresh deli style breakfast and that was not the case. I would go back to try a pastry but forget about going back for a breakfast sandwich. Reheat breakfast sandwich reminded me of getting breakfast from the Cooper Library canteen when pulling an all nighter.,negative,restaurant

174147,Ok I normally would say 4 stars but because the amount of chaos to have someone help you made me not want to return for a while. I like the pasties and desserts and they are pretty good but I timed it and I had to take a number (#11) and they were on #1. It took 25 mins for me to get a small box of cookies. They must have had at least 40 people standing around waiting to order or waiting for an order. There was only 5 people working behind the counter...seems fine right? But what I noticed is there was NO URGENCY what so ever by any of the counter staff. Next in the middle of the chaos of of the counter staff takes a large circular tray/plate to arrange cookies to take across the street (maybe for a restaurant or something. She then walked them out and walked down the street. I wouldn't say that is the appropriate time to arrange a plate and do deliveries especially when the place is jam packed. It went to 4 people behind the counter. Might have been smarter to handle customers in store and have deliveries handled another way. Sorry but no cookies are worth 25 min wait. And they should drill their staff to serve a customer within 3 min. They would give much better customer service if they considered doing a retraining and changed it up a bit. I've been coming here for a few years and it's always the same. Time for a change,negative,restaurant

174258,"We were so excited to finally try out this Italian bake shop, but we were really let down. First, it's a very cute, simple little shop with lots of parking and some picnic tables for outside munching, which I think is great. Inside is cramped--no biggie though. Next, the staff were adequately pleasant--nothing to write home about. They took our order, packed everything nicely and took the payment. But the food was subpar. This is not our first foray into Italian pastries--in NY they rule the pasty scene and everything they make is amazing. Not here. I noticed all croissants, lobster tails, cream horns, and such were far too overcooked--really dark to nearly burnt on top. This really ruins it for me. But here's what we order: Lobster tail: Yes, despite the above comment about being overcooked, I ordered 2 because I love them. I could not eat nearly half of the pastry because it was so hard from being nearly burned, but the cream filling is out of this world amazing. Sfingi: The pastry part of these is done very nicely, but the filling was lumpy, barely sweetened, and had a strong almond flavor. Tiramisu: Probably the worst we've had. The filling is more like a pudding (it's supposed to be primarily mascarpone), the lady fingers were dry, and there was no hint of the lady fingers having been soaked in coffee or rum or anything like that. Quite a disappointment, as tiramisu is my husband's favorite. Napoleon: The pastry layers were barely cooked and were the consistency of barely baked pie crust (kinda chewy). It's supposed to be made with puff pastry, and there was zero puff going on. The filling was again more like a pudding consistency--it's supposed to be a pastry cream. Very disappointing. Overall, disappointing. I didn't expect to love everything, but I thought it would be reasonable to expect something to be great. Too bad.",negative,restaurant
174289,"The baked goods are sweet, but the customer service is sour. I came here with my family tonight to pick up a few things. We had been waiting in line for approximately 5 minutes when one of the employees questioned whether or not we had masks. We did not have masks because we thought the Mecklenburg County mandate ended today. The employee told us ""It ends tomorrow, so I can't let it fly tonight."" Mind you, it is 8:15PM and ""tomorrow"" is literally 3 hours and 45 minutes from now.... How ridiculous. 1.) Any place with good customer service would have complimentary masks to offer to people if they are going to actually force patrons to wear them (nowhere else in Charlotte enforces this, except for healthcare facilities, btw). We would have put masks on to be respectful of their rule (even if it is idiotic) if they had offered them to us. 2.)The employee could have offered to take our order at the walk up window outside as a compromise, but didn't even bother to offer that as a solution because he was too busy being the smug mask cop. We have been frequent customers here over the last year, but I don't think we'll be back again. Spending my hard earned money at a place where the employees lack the critical thinking and interpersonal skills to diplomatically resolve what THEY perceive to be a problem doesn't sit right with me.",negative,restaurant
174396,"I really wanted to like this bakery, but I just cant. We actually went twice, thinking the first time was just a one off...but no. The french macrons we're just awful. One had a slight freezer burn wang, and the other this weird texture. The rainbow cookie had no taste whatsoever. The cookies are scones, not cookies, and kind of bland. The vibe is cool; hip music and young people, but i got the feeling they're trying to be more of a ""cool"" bakery than a ""good"" bakery.",negative,restaurant
174397,"I'm so disappointed at their customer service. I had other friends tell me of their bad experiences but I never had anything bad to say about this place. I still think their desserts are great but if the customers are being treated so horribly for asking a question and placing an order, who will buy those delicious desserts? I'm so horrified by my experience and the way I was treated by one of their employees that I am so hesitant to go back to buy a piece of cake! If you can look pass that and ignore the rudeness of others, please try it out! Following is my comment on their Instagram: Delicious desserts! Any time we have family over, we always order from this bakery. My kids love their cheesecake and almost every week, we get desserts from here. Unfortunately, their employees are extremely rude and have 0 idea of what customer service is. My family and Ive been loyal customers since last year and really want this local bakery to succeed during these hard times, but I was shocked the way I was treated by one of their employees (can't remember the name, either Cory or Jacob) on Saturday evening when I took my guests to get some dessert. The owners are good people and they care so much about their employees, and I know this because I had a conversation with Paul Villani regarding a special order I placed in December and how he was so genuine and caring towards his employees. I hope their employees would care just as much about them. Honestly, I care so much about their business and truly love this place, I still tipped the guy 15% after his disgraceful and humiliating comments. I wish you all the best Paul & Amanda Villani but I will not be coming to your bakery any more until you show the same care and genuineness to your customers as you do for your employees. You lost a loyal customer!",negative,restaurant

I asked what type of frosting it was and they said buttercream; however, this is not traditional buttercream with a good flavor. The cake is not vanilla. It has a slight metallic flavor like something went wrong during the baking process and it was slightly over baked. I am very disappointed in the quality of this cake.",negative,restaurant
174523,"I was really looking forward to trying a new bakery. I love bakeries and seek them out everywhere. We ordered two 16oz House iced coffees, a cheddar jalapeÃ±o Baily (bagel), chocolate croissant and a black & white cookie to the tune of $19. I will say the baked goods were good. I liked the bagel. But the cookie was slightly stale and the iced coffee turned to watered down coffee by the time we got to the car. I returned them and asked for two regular coffees, there was no issue there. Now, coffee is certainly supposed to be hot. But this coffee was HOT. We waited twenty minutes before it being hot enough to sip and ended up just tossing both full cups after a half hour. So all in all it just wasn't worth it. (This was the Pecan Ave location) I am adding more to my review a couple days later: after checking the online receipt I was emailed I noticed I was charged an extra $1 for cream cheese for my bagel. The cream cheese comes in a small packet that resembles something for mayo at fast food spots. And I got charged $1 for that? Yeah, will not be visiting again or recommending.",negative,restaurant
174602,"I am not impressed and quite frankly I think their baguettes are overpriced and overrated. For local standards their bread is better than the horrors of American store-bought bread. I bought two baguette loaves at Willy Street Coop on Thursday evening. By Friday morning the baguettes were hard. This tells me that the bread was either already a day old when I bought it, or they don't know what they are doing. I spent three years in Germany and toured around Europe. Fresh baguettes do not behave like this. Batch Backhouse cannot match Madison Sourdough or Clausen's. The Baguette had large holes; it didn't really taste like anything. I would think it hadn't been given enough time to rest and develop flavor through longer fermentation, or like they hadn't started with a great yeast starter. Don't forget to bring lots of cash. These people will rob you blind and will not pay their suppliers a fair price for their inputs. The product at Willy Street cost $2.75 per loaf. The Batch Store charges $3.75 per loaf. Madison Sourdough is $3.50 per loaf and it looks larger. It is also sourdough, which is much better than what Batch offered. The girl at Batch said they only use the finest ingredients, (produced by Norwegian bachelor farmers). I asked her what the farmers got for a bushel of wheat, and she didn't know, and I told her I thought Batch was making very rich profits. I asked her if she knew the cost to make a loaf vs. the sales price. She didn't know the cost to produce a loaf. In conclusion, The Baguettes of Batch are not good at all - Suggest one buys their breads at Madison Sourdough - Much, much better product at a cheaper price. I will not buy Batch products again",negative,restaurant

We stopped in this summer and had a horrible experience. We were under the impression that cones were 50 cents because of the promotional poster on the window. Upon asking (politely I may add) why the price difference, we were met with yelling. Not loud talking but yelling. When my husband said that we would still buy it, the gentlemen in his 50's, dumped the ice cream back into the bucket. That sucked. We left.

He clearly saw us waiting patiently for him to finish with the party he was serving. When he continued to ignore us and serve 3 Caucasian groups that had walked in after us, I came to the sad realization that we were being ignored because we were non-white (I'm Asian and was with Asian and middle eastern friends). When I tried to bring to his attention that we were actually next, we continued to be ignored.

Addition to my review, within a short period this same day, I received a message from Ghirardelli Corporate Customer Relations, concerning this.

Maybe this location should think about closing at 2am instead. My fiancÃ© and I ordered are usual and it's very basic: vanilla ice cream with dark chocolate fudge. Although the same price, we were SHOCKED to find out the the portion is MUCH smaller than what we had in San Diego & Chicago! I mean I shouldn't be surprised because it's Vegas, but I would rather pay Vegas pricing rather than skimping on portion size. It was very disappointing.

The sprinkles are giving everything they've got to save the entire experience but unfortunately it's not enough.

I ordered a regular coffee shake without the alcohol because actually wanted a pick me up before we left Vegas. But I couldn't even finish. I mean, if cereal milk is your jam, go for it.

175435,Not worth it. Shake flavors aren't great and the cookies are like a store bought packaged cookie.,negative,restaurant
175462,This was my first time trying the soft serve ice cream and the shake. Both tasted sour and spoiled and made me sick. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to taste like that or not. Super unfortunate for how much I've heard good reviews from this place.,negative,restaurant
175479,"I'm not quite understanding the hype. I got the cereal milk shake and it was very off. It was really salty and didn't had any sweetness to it at all. The ice cream part just tasted like as if I threw milk in the freezer and made it into ice cream. Then, I added corn flakes and blended it all up. It really wasn't anything special. The price is ridiculous as well. I got a regular size, which turned out to be $10 for a 12oz cup. Considering the how much I disliked the product and price, I don't think they deserve more than 1 star. I might come back once more to try their soft serve and update my review if that goes well.",negative,restaurant
175509,I stopped by around 11 pm they only had one flavor available . The soft serve was terrible and expensive! . Mc Donald's ice scream tasted better than this !,negative,restaurant
175535,"Maybe I'll have to give it another go. Was so excited to finally try this place after all the talk and the hype and such. Maybe because it was later in the night we went, maybe it was an off night but the whole experience left me confused. What was all the hype about? The cookies come prepackaged which left me thinking.. soooooo they're not made fresh? Should've taken that as a warning. Took a bite and all I can taste was sugar. You could've given me a store bought cookie, put it in the same wrap and I would've never tasted the difference. The truffles were okay, have you tasted Godiva's birthday cake truffles? you should. it's better.",negative,restaurant
175546,"Its really disappointing how bad they have gotten. They changed their menu items and cant answer questions about them - and they got my order wrong. I hate being in las vegas, and i just wanted some comfort food that i like - and they just butchered it. Super bummed out. Edit - i got to my room and i'm looking at the pie slice and it's not what I had asked for - which is tough to do when the menu items change and the people behind the counter just say ""yes"" to whatever you ask. Also - I just didn't have time to wait for you to remake make my iced coffee - you gave me a hot coffee when i ordered iced - because i was running late for a meeting. I ordered 2 items and you got them both wrong - I walked 6 miles there and back - have I earned the right to ask for a refund? I feel like i have. Could I please have my money back? You can have the cookie thing back - it's not what I wanted.",negative,restaurant
175565,"Everything sounded so good and delicious, but after paying close to $13.xx for ONE cookie and ONE milkshake...it was SO not worth it!!! I ordered a chocolate cereal milk milkshake for my kids and a cookie (I forgot which one I got). The $8.50 milkshake tasted like a typical chocolate milkshake! Nothing special at all!! I could've went to In-n-out and got a cheaper one that tasted the same. And the cookie was no better than the frozen dough you can bake yourself at home! I will definitely not recommend wasting your time and money here.",negative,restaurant
175588,"At $14 a slice I got refrigerated flavored birthday cake. It was so bad that I was so upset for paying that much for a cake I didn't eat. The frosting tasted like whipped sugar nothing else. The cake was so dry and it looked like it was made days ago. I kept tasting small bites to get a flavor, but it had none. I was so confused as to why it's so famous. I'm from Los Angeles and we have one there. So disappointing. I will never go back while in Vegas or to the one in my town. Overpriced, overhyped Tasteless cake smh it's a pretty slice to look at that's about it.",negative,restaurant
175636,"I was excited to go to Milk Bar as I have been to the one in NY, and loved it. here... I was pretty disappointed. The soft serve was... salty. The texture was spot on to how I remember, but the flavors were very flat. I remember there being a harmonious play between savory and sweet, and instead there was a strange, flat salty flavor with almost no sweet. Plus, the pricing was extremely expensive with miniscule portions. The crack pie had great flavor but the serving size was literally the size of a restaurant match book. :(",negative,restaurant
175712,"The service here is great. The guy who helped me greeted me with a smile, and was very pleasant and helpful. This isn't a walk in restaurant. You walk up to the counter and place your order from their selection of desserts that include cookies and whole cakes. The birthday cake is their most famous cake and the only one the sell by the slice. The birthday cake costs a hefty $16. I got it, and I regret it. It did not live up to the hype. It was a decent cake. It wasn't bad, but for the price I expect more. The milk they soak it with makes it similar to a tres leche (but not quite as wet). It's on par with a grocery store cake at best. I'm a cake connoisseur and i've had far better for far less. Maybe the cookies are better. But don't waste your time or money on the birthday cake. Just go for the cute appearance and nice service.",negative,restaurant
175731,"Mehhh, I've seriously experienced better. Maybe I've been spoiled by all the good ice cream in LA already. There wasn't much variety as I was hoping for for an ice cream spot..in Vegas. I had the Cereal Milk with sprinkles added and got bored of the flavors real quick. That rarely happens with ice cream for me. Overall, overhyped and overpriced :(",negative,restaurant
175773,"Man alive this place was gross! I might have built it up big in my mind, but not good!! I am so glad they give out free samples because I would have been upset Getting totally over priced not good ice cream. We tried the plain cereal milk, fruity pebbles milk ice cream and crack pie ice cream and all of them were not good at all! The service was great, no line, just not good at all. Glad I tried it and glad I didn't spend any money.",negative,restaurant
175804,"The worst! We purchased two cookies that tasted extremely stale so we went down the next morning to ask if we can return them or exchange them for something else. The cashier called the manager Katie who I explained the situation to and she very rudely and quickly snatched the cookies and receipt out of my hands and handed me two of the same cookies. I was just dumbfounded by the interaction and how snippy and poor-mannered she was. We are from NYC and we know what the cookies usually taste like, I did not want the same ones and didn't appreciate the entire interaction. I can see why this spot has poor reviews. 1 star for the poor tasting cookies, Zero stars for service.",negative,restaurant
175807,"What a freaking ripoff! I didn't try Momofuku Milk Bar the last time I was in New York, so I was excited to hear they opened one on the West Coast several months ago. I've seen photos of their soft serve all over Instagram for years now, and I wanted to see why it was so special. There were mixed reviews of the Vegas and New York locations across Yelp, but I still decided to give it a try for the experience. Location/Ambiance (5/5): Milk Bar is a cute ice cream stand with a pink-and-white theme that fits nicely with the vibe of The Cosmopolitan. It's located on the second floor of the hotel next to its Asian fusion restaurant counterpart, Momofuku. Service (5/5): Came at midnight on a Sunday night, and there was no line. The cashier warmly greeted us and offered generous samples without us having to ask. We tried three of their soft serve offerings: Cereal Milk w/ Corn Flakes, Crack Pie, and Cinnaswirl. Soft Serve & Prices (2/5): The texture was nice and smooth; it wasn't too runny or frozen. They also give you a decent amount. However, I really did not like any of the soft serve flavors... They were also each priced at a hefty $6.50 (with tax) for a single serving. Yikes! 1. Cereal Milk w/ Corn Flakes (1/5) - The soft serve tasted like rotten milk. I was trying to hide my disgusted expression while tasting it in front of the worker.. The Corn Flakes did the dessert no justice, as it made everything weirdly salty and just not appetizing. 2. Crack Pie (?/5) - I honestly do not remember much of what this tasted like or how it differed from the Cereal Milk. I just remember that I was not a fan. 3. Cinnaswirl (3/5) - The best of the bunch in my opinion, as it resembled Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I wasn't in love with the flavor after sampling this, but I still ended up ordering it because I felt bad for spending so much time sampling. I later wished I had just tipped the guy and walked away, since the flavor became way too sweet after several bites. I couldn't even finish it because my teeth felt coated with sugar, and I'm normally one to lick my bowls clean... Try this place at your own discretion or for the experience, but there's a reason for all of the Milk Bar locations' averaged 3 - 3.5 star ratings.",negative,restaurant
175809,"I did expect better. I've seen the reviews, seen the chef on tv, and even went back twice. But all three items didn't ever call me back. The crack pie made me believe I could easily quit crack. It was forgettable. The birthday cake shake was not the party I was expecting. And the compost cookie was not even as good as Panera's Kitchen sink cookie. Too bad because I really wanted to like this place as it's location is awesome and the help is great there! I'll be back at the Cosmo, and when I do, hopefully, they'll have something new for me too try.",negative,restaurant
175833,I was very disappointed in the cereal milk soft serve. There was no flavor and it wasn't good at all. I've ordered it at the NY location so I know what it's supposed to taste like. Total waste of $6. The crack pie was pretty good. I ended up dipping it in the soft serve to try and give it more flavor.,negative,restaurant
175884,"Very nice location on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel. I was so happy to see the ad while at the Cosmo pool and even more so because I was actually contemplating paying $63 for a small cake to get shipped to me from New York. I opted for the slice of confetti cake and boy was I disappointed! $16 for a small slice of dry, crumbly cake with no flavor! I expected it to be stellar based on all the hype but maybe this was an old cake and I got a bad slice. I would not go back but glad I got to experience milk in Vegas.",negative,restaurant
175986,WoW! Don't get the cookies! Overpriced and terribile in taste. Subway has better cookies.,negative,restaurant
176028,"I'll start by saying that I practically worship Christina Tosi. I'm a classically trained pastry chef and have always looked forward to trying her product. The actual sweets themselves were fine, but the prices were outrageous. I would have loved for the cookies to have been fresh, but they were prepackaged and the compost cookie I so looked forward to tasted very stale. Disappointed!",negative,restaurant
176055,Not a fan. It was my first time and the service wasn't very friendly as I was asking about what to try. I just felt rushed and like I was a burden to them. The ice cream was too runny for me and way over priced for what it was.,negative,restaurant
176084,"Tried 4 different cookies. Too sweet, not fresh, not delicious. Lots of ingredients that seem to be there for spectacle rather than effect. Very disappointing. I really wish I hadn't spent the money, and I don't often say that. Frankly I think the celebrity chef/baker with their name on this place should be a bit embarrassed to serve these. I assume the profits outweigh the shame. The counter person was very nice.",negative,restaurant
176100,"I really wanted to love this place. I'd heard so much about it. NYorkers love this place and I was so happy to finally have one in Vegas. Sad to say, the cookies and the cereal milk soft serve with cornflakes were strange. Flavors were on the savory side. I don't mind savory, but the cookies were not good at all. I took a bite of the 3 Flavors- corn, compost and cornflake chocolate chip- marshmallow. All 3 were meh. I love sweets, but these are not as good as the hype. Two stars as the service was good. Informative and friendly.",negative,restaurant
176104,"Meeeeeh! After a tasty and delectable dining experience at Scarpetta I suggested we walk right over to Milk for a post dinner treat. All 10 of us ordered something, you're welcome Milk.... Soft Serve was okay but oddly very salty and I am normally a salty cat. In fact, so were all the cookies we picked up (Double Chocolate and Compost cookies). I bought 2 Blueberry and Cream cookies but gave them away to friends so I couldn't tell you how those were but also didn't get any feedback from those I gave it to. So letdown by Milk and the $80 we spent on Soft Serve and Cookies. $80! Even the girl at the register was a little salty too. I will say that the Fruity Pebbles Soft Serve was the best because it had more dynamic flavor. Otherwise, I'm happy if we never go back. Glad we got to try it though.",negative,restaurant
176146,"Pretty letdown at what ""looked"" to be an exciting new place. I saw this being constructed a few months ago, and wanted to give it a try. Place is very very small, and full of the drunken guests taking up the line asking for a million samples. Meanwhile 4 other employees just stood around doing nothing really, where they could've helped me. I got a sample of the fruity cereal, and it was pretty gross, obviously full of artificial flavoring and just left a bad after taste. Finally ordered a strawberry ""Quake"" shake, and a cookie. The shake was a major letdown, and flat of flavor. Couldn't eat more than 2 bites and threw away. The cookie was even worse, just garbage: NO flavor whatsoever. That was thrown away as well. Giving them 1 star for the marketing, as the signs & promotional items got me really interested. Unfortunately I just don't thing they serve a good product. I also liked them open late, but besides that, I'll clearly never return.",negative,restaurant
176212,"Got ""milked"" for $20 and came up sour. Literally threw everything I bought in the garbage. Not sure who is handing the ""awards"" for this but....no! The experience was like waking up excited for the last bit of your favorite cereal and pouring some cold clumpy sour milk in the bowl. Yeah it's that great.",negative,restaurant
176237,"Super disappointing. I have been hearing about Milk for years from a blogger in NYC who raves about it. Not sure if it's different in NYC, but in Vegas everything was prepackaged. I thought it would be like a high end bakery, but instead I felt like I was getting over priced and not very good convenience store snacks.",negative,restaurant
176246,How dare you charge $14 for a single slice of cake and not even try to make it taste good or fresh. I am personally outraged and count this among the worst transgressions in a year of terrible injustices occurring daily. Honestly if I wanted something tiny that tasted like shit and wasted my money and left me disappointed I would call my ex.,negative,restaurant
176259,"I never write reviews but, do not waste your time on the cookies!! I should have been suspicious since they're packaged in plastic meaning they weren't baked there. Anyway, they were so stale and hard that even heating them up in the oven didn't do them any justice. Way too sweet and one dimensional, like you can barely taste the chocolate chips. Sadly, I bought 6 of them, such a waste:(",negative,restaurant
176308,"I had high hopes for this after watching Netflix's Chef Table. I really admired Christina Tosi's creativity and hard work but everything we tried were not good at all. I've messed up a lot of cookies but they were edible.. The compost cookie was so hard and tasted like banking soda, we threw it away after a bite. The blueberry and cream was ok and soft but lacking the tasted of blueberry... crack pie was so teeny for $6 but I guess it's The Strip. Buttery but not that amazing. The birthday truffles were ok. The cereal milk with cornflakes was definitely worth it and it tastes exactly what a cereal milk taste like. But other than that.. maybe the NYC location is better.",negative,restaurant

We get there and Michele is the cashier , we are asking her questions and she just seemed over her job and gave us attitude. We asked her which size was the regular and ""she's like they're over there"" and we look over and there were 3 cups so we still didn't know which one was the regular and at that point we knew she didn't want to help us, so we got our order and left. The girl who then said ""shake is ready"" didn't say what it was and we looked at that counter and she's like yeah here. Over all the customer service was not great.",negative,restaurant

I was reading reviews on here & decided I had to try the slice of birthday cake and also got a baby chocolate malt shake. I was disappointed in the cake. It tasted like regular cheap grocery store cake. Had a few bites & threw it away ($14 for the cake) The chocolate malt shake was very good, I enjoyed it. Creamy & the pieces of malt were a good ratio. My friend ordered the White Russian shake that contains kahlua & vodka. He wasn't a fan. It was watery & he said it had a weird taste he couldn't describe. However there are quite a few choices & these are only a couple things, I would not return.",negative,restaurant
176344,"Tasted everything and was not impressed. It was not like the items were bad, just not worth the extra cost or wait.

Maybe New York store is better?? Birthday truffles were the best but nothing THAT great.",negative,restaurant
176351,"The cookies are $8 each and unfortunately they're a little less enjoyable than the cookie my local Subway gives me for free if I choose to dine in.

176366,"David Chang...dude. I've read your books, watched your shows - you had my expectations high! Milk flopped. Out of date, full of shelf life fillers - hard cookies. Why not bake fresh and toss like...a bakery. Half the staff REALLY cared, the others...nope.",negative,restaurant
176391,"I had a crack pie shake, or whatever it was called. It was crazily sweet, way too sweet. Something approaching drinking maple syrup. My wife didn't like it. I kind of did, kind of didn't.

Don't get me started on the child size servings.",negative,restaurant
176444,This is the worst cake for its price that I have ever tasted. My sister bought the cake for my birthday. I felt my birthday got ruined with this stupid cake. Just sweet thats all. La bonita cake are way better. This pricey cake is just like a $9 cake.,negative,restaurant

I guess my expectations were set very high for this spot, but I see that the NYC location is better.",negative,restaurant
176491,"Totally disappointing given the hype. Cereal milk soft serve ($6) had a creamy smooth texture but faint flavor. A small slice of Crack pie ($6.50) was cold, mushy and just plain sweet.

176515,"So, I'm sad to report that I was extremely disappointed in my first visit to Milk Bar Las Vegas. After all the hype surrounding Christina Tosi's success and her ""legendary"" Birthday Cake, how could I not try it? First, they served the cake cold. Do you know what happens to buttercream frosting when it's refrigerated? Exactly, it solidifies. So they essentially served us solid butter fat. Total and complete sin against nature. Second, the crumb, which is supposed to be moist from the milk soak, was dry and crumbly to the point that it broke apart under the weight of the fork. Third, the cake layers were flavorless. And fourth, the 1.5"" layers of frosting between the cake layers was too much, too cold, too solid. Almost inedible. The corn flake/marshmallow/chocolate chip cookie wasn't much better. To top it all off, either the cake, the cookie, or a combination of the two left an unpleasant aftertaste in both our mouths. Totally not worth the $19 spent. Highly overrated.",negative,restaurant
176523,"The service was great, but the actual desserts are mediocre. I sampled the famous milk ice cream that tasted like day old Frosted Flakes, which just wasn't very good. So, I ended up just jumping in and ordered the vanilla cake with sprinkles in it. Another, sad disappointment. The reviews posted on here are true. I was shocked when I read them, that is why I still tried this place. I had to discover that the rumors were to bad to be true.",negative,restaurant
176690,"Well...I know that I won't convince many to stay away from this local institution, but if I can convince one, it will make my night better. I waited in line for 1 hour and was at least 20 min away from getting served when I left. Yes, it was Mom's weekend and they wee mobbed but there is such an indifference to the way they do business that I am hoping to convince anyone that reads this review STAY AWAY. The same person who takes the order, makes the order. There are only 4 people working here and the lines are back to the street. The counter person takes the order, walk toward the back with no sense of urgency, slowly fills the cup, talks to his co-worker for 30 seconds, goes to the topping area, same indifference to the 70-100 people in line, finally gets back to he counter and ask the same person what they want next (God forbid he could've made 2 at the same time). The owners couldn't care less that there far better ways to do things. Hire 3 more people. One person, takes orders and money, another makes the order. The time would be cut b 30%. And here's another idea, the teenage workers should actually be managed, Hurry just a little, don't talk to your co-workers, if one of your friends comes to the window, don't spend 3 mi asking about his life etc. CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER. But the owner clearly doesn't care about his customers because they wait and wait and wait. Except for one.

176730,"Pros: Tastes like ice cream Cons: Custard melts too quickly, slow service, incompetent staff My Advice: It's worth a try, but in the future I'll likely just opt for DQ We visited Jarling's last night for the first time after reading all the raving reviews. It did not live up to all the fuss. When we got there, the line was to the door, so we were about 6 or 7 people back at our window. Even with 2 employees working that window it took a good 25 minutes or so to get to the front. When we finally got a chance, we ordered two single dip cups for the kids, a single dip waffle cone for my fiance and a peanut butter fudge snowstorm (their equivalent to DQ's blizzard) for me. They guy that took our order clearly had no clue what he was doing. After wandering around aimlessly for several minutes, he finally passed our order on to someone else. Even then it took forever for our order to be made. Meanwhile, the man who I presume was the manager just stood around watching and periodically yelling at customers in line to either come inside or go outside, but to close the door. When they finally got the order up to the window it was already melting. Then the girl couldn't figure out how to work the cash register, so it took quite a while to get my change back. By the time I was able to get my order, get my change and walk to the picnic tables outside, there was melted custard dripping all over the place. The ice cream (or custard) was good, but not great and certainly not worth the price. The snowstorm was smooth and had a rich peanut butter flavor to it.

Upon arrival we were greeted and found it surprising that when we asked to see the menu the cashier left for about ten minutes. After taking our order I asked of we could add an additional item to which have rolled her eyes and headed back to the kitchen.

We called the day before to give the workers a heads up that we would be coming in with a larger group. However, when we arrived our group was rushed, spoken to like children, and even had some of our orders tossed at us instead of handed to us like a good paying customer. When we were leaving we could overhear the workers talking about some of our girls in an inappropriate manner. I believe that this type of treatment was uncalled for as we did our best to insure that our group treated the workers with respect and grace even though that was not the treatment that we were given. I am so disappointed because our girls were so excited for this celebration and it was tainted by the workers contempt.

I absolutely hate it when a place is highly rated on my beloved Yelp or even culturally in general, only to find out that it was for novelty over actual superiority. It's like someone hooking you up with someone sexy and you get all excited because they look good in the pictures but you meet them in person and they have no personality. That's donut bar. I waited like months to try this place because I try to eat healthy most of the time. I drooled over the photos of the ""strawberry poppa tart"" the ""creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut"" etc I walked in and saw that ""Brad fritter"" and got one of those too on good faith even though I don't even like apple in baked goods. Because this place has a lot of stars, so its GOTTA BE GOOD. Right?? And after an extra strenuous workout to prep for the big day, I finally got to try all of the donuts I had been pining over. And none of them rocked my world. Not one. I get there and the shop is cute, clean, very nice displays and an absolutely wonderful staff. To my surprise the donuts are even waaaaaaay bigger than pictures communicate. My a*s was EXCITED! I got a strawberry poppa tart, creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut, Brad fritter, Nutella glaze, and birthday cake glaze, and not a single one of them was worthy of more than 2 stars. They are big and fluffy but they catered more to having giant donuts, than delicious ones. Something about the actual donut bodies themselves were just plain and boring and they topped them with glazes & toppings that will get you all exited but are ultimately lackluster as well. Except the candied bacon on the Brad fritter. Best part of the whole donut box was that bacon. That wound up being my breakfast. Do yourself a favor, and head on over to ""Master Donuts"" on the eastside or ""RONALDS DONUTS"" in China town! Theyre the ""change yo lyfe"" type of good donuts. Trust.",negative,restaurant
178401,"Maybe I'm used to something a little different on the East Coast, but the Donut Bar was all bark and no bite. They all looked very aesthetic, but not one of them was memorable or had any real outstanding flavor Tried 3 donuts from their large selection. Cake Batter(Oreo Mini) $3 Big Poppa Tart (Strawberry) $5 Strawberry Split $4 The big poppa tart was the biggest let down, the filling of the donut was the same dry sticky filling as a actual pop tart, it did not blend very well with the soft doughy texture. It's a little bit of a hike away from the strip, I would say not worth the journey.",negative,restaurant
178452,"The operating hours are not accurate, they should be updated to reflect that they close when they sell out which is no specific time. I went to take my 8 year old son who loves donuts more than anything, he opened the door to walk in and was confronted by a very much less than friendly lady who dang near closed the door on his foot while saying very unpleasantly ""were closed"" I tried to ask her what would be the best time to come and she answered ""we are open until we sell out!"" Still trying to close the door on my son, this doesn't give me a good vibe or a feeling that I want to return when they do open, if your closed that's fine, if your having a bad day fine but learn some customer service skills especially when dealing with children. I will NOT be returning to patronize this business",negative,restaurant

178563,"I'm coming from being a fan of Doughnut Plant in NYC. Not sure if we had stale ones because I ordered from Uber Eats or for their price you're paying for a batter that is not up to standard. Creme Brulee was the best. Strawberry cheesecake. Nah. Lemon Blueberry, the flavour was there but still not that great. I will be open-minded, maybe better when you get it fresh. Would want to go back to try French Toast Donut.",negative,restaurant
178573,"So disappointed by this place. The donuts were just sad. They look amazing but taste like disappointment. We got there in the afternoon time so they were doing $10 boxes (as many donuts you can fit in a box for $10), we were so excited to get to try a variety. Smores on fire - eh & cake donut was sad Triple chocolate - more like 1 chocolate Blueberry & Meyer lemon - decent Creme brulee - eh, cream was gross Chai - okay Chocolate covered old fashioned - gross Poptart - okay but so overly sweet Nutella - the only one where the donut dough was good Chocolate milk - don't get it, not worth it 2 stars cause we would eat 2 donuts again (blueberry & Meyer lemon & nutella) and the staff was really nice",negative,restaurant

178608,"This is an update from my orginal post. This is now my second time visiting Donutbar and unfortunately it will be mt last. I totally understand the excitement about this location and how it reminds people of Voodoo Donuts from Portland but it's not the same. What makes Voodoo Donuts different from Donut Bar here in Las Vegas is that they never out. They are continuously making their popular donuts for the people. For example, if Donutbar knows that their French Toast donut is only sold on the weekend, then they should make enough, due to it's popularity. In regards to their donuts they are super soft and fresh I truly enjoyed the split open strawberry donut because the strawberries are fresh and whipped cream is really smooth,Fresh & Light. The strawberry cheesecake donut simply tastes like a strawberry jelly filled donut.",negative,restaurant
178704,"We got here at noon also, and also found there to be no line. We were excited to try it, and pleasantly surprised that they had several vegan donut choices. And it was buy one get one free, so we were out of there for under $4. The donuts were very very sweet. I know donuts are supposed to be sugary but this took it to a new level. My teeth hurt a little, so I picked the fruit off of the top and threw the rest away. My husband said that he had to do the same with his. That said, we did arrive late so we had slim pickings. Perhaps if we got there earlier, we would have had more choices?",negative,restaurant
178730,"so reading the reviews for this shop, I was expecting some deliciousness, some extraordinary, some awesomeness and all I got was another ""wtf"" moment, and a feeling of ""should I call and complain and ask for my money back""...I mean, I dropped $25 for 8 donuts...ya let's get to the review... so I found myself in the downtown area recently, and remember hearing about a donut that crunched on top, looked it up and was happy it was there. so I drove over to the spot in downtown, and checked it out. walked into the shop, it's small, narrow, but it gets right to the point. the display of donuts was very nice. they all look delicious, and in my mind I was excited to finally try the assortment I was putting together. I went for 2 of the creme brulee donuts, one that I think had a velvet cake inside, one of the poptart donuts, a white sprinkle, and a chocolate top one and some others. total was $25 (price shock hits, it's donuts!!) but ok I paid it, drove home and dove in with wifey. this is where it just went wrong. now, I usually don't take photos, but recently I have been of the meals and stuff I'm eating or places I'm going to, and this place got the picture... every single donut we ate was dry. they were all over cooked I guess. the batter used had no flavor or sweetness. the flavors were not there, it was like trying to enjoy it but not...I only took a bite or 2 of each donut and trashed it. throughout the day just picked at them all. when I got the one that crunches, the creme brulee one, I was just SO let down. the taste was honestly gross. that mixture of the crunch on the top of your mouth, then mixing it with a soft/dry donut that has no flavor was just really gross. and I'm not picky, especially when it comes to what should have been sweet and delicious, was a major fail. again, every donut was dry, and they all had no flavor or bland flavoring. even the pop tart donut was a bust. the cake mix they use is just no good. I don't know if it was that day or what, but no go for me. now, I've tried pink box donuts which was ok. the only donut shop here in town that seems to be excellent every time is Winchells on Meadows Lane with the subway. that place is 5 star superb. I understand though, this donut bar place, it made it on tv or whatever, and people want to see it, but all these 5 star reviews is just not possible if it's consistently like my experience when quality comes in. check out my photos...you'll see what I mean.",negative,restaurant
178743,"Not sure what the hype is over this place. I live 8 hours away and could not wait to check this place out while vacationing in Vegas. The lady helping us acted like wE were a bother to her day. WTF? The doughnuts were fresh (2 stars), but very doughy. The coffee ""blah"". Bottom line......customer service is (should be)EVERYTHING!! If you don't like your job, then move on. Our experience could have been so much better. Glad I made the time to visit, but will not be returning!! Side note......ran into a Las Vegas police officer who was super friendly and kind!!",negative,restaurant
178932,"I can't rate the quality of the donuts, due to the poor service I received I left without purchasing any. If you have a certain greeting for your 1st time customers, it should be practiced with ALL first timers not just those the staff choose to give the new customer greeting to. When I made it known that the same courtesy was not given to me, the response was ""well do you want to buy anything"", after that disrespectful treatment I made the choice to not patronize this business ever!!!!",negative,restaurant
179079,"Definitely NOT ""the best donuts in the world"" as they claim on their box. Get real. Office brought in a box of them and they were just okay, nothing special.

179102,"I had their pink sprinkles and creme brulee. There was nothing special about them. The filling for the creme brulee was one sided and minimal. The pink sprinkles one was not even moist on the inside. It was very dry. And even with a mustache, the lady called me ma'am lol.",negative,restaurant
179172,"Tried this place after hearing about the hype. Had to wake up extra early so try all the flavors before they sold out. This was not worth the hype, we got a dozen doughnuts since we don't live in Vegas. The special doughnuts weren't anything special. The creme brulee didn't have enough filling nor did the other flavors. All the doughnuts tasted normal, flavors weren't special or ""wow"" about them compared to most normal doughnut shops. I've had better doughnuts in the east coast. This was such a disappointment.",negative,restaurant

179259,Pinkbox is better hands down. This place is overpriced and the donuts are mediocre at best. I set the standard too high and was expecting Pinkbox quality or better.

My first and last time!,negative,restaurant

179441,"Came here again because of my colleagues. Of course I decide to order donuts. This time I decide to try something different and ask questions. Don't ask questions because you will get attitude. My colleagues love the fact the girls demeanor changed to rude towards me. You sell donuts lady and you have a customer service job. Smile and put the donuts in the box and the cashier will ring me up. The donuts are good. Yes, they are because they are donuts. The workers there need to humble down. The previous donut shop had the customer service and the downtown vibe.",negative,restaurant

I don't know how this place has good reviews unless the people who tasted this ice cream came here during the pandemic and didn't realize they lost their taste yet. Drove 15 minutes here and was so disappointed. Ice cream taste like someone went to the dollar store bought the cheapest vanilla ice cream they could find, added a bunch of unnecessary food colorings which gave the ice cream a metal aftertaste and dumped a bunch of sugar in it. Taste like something I would give a bunch of two year olds at a kids birthday party but that's only if I didn't like the kids. But I love kids so I would never do that. I'm the type of person where even if I don't like my food I'll finish it so it won't go to waste but I happily threw it out after the second bite.",negative,restaurant
179816,I am a 90's kid! Urkel on the wall? Here for it! Blasting some smoothe 90's beats- oh bring it! But the 90's here didn't translate into 2022. The staff- they did their job but weren't friendly. My dunkaroo shake (oh yeah I had dunkaroos in my lunchbox as a kid) was great in theory but the frosting kept getting stuck in my straw. It was not blended as well. It wasn't smooth. I did not like taking sips and being hit with a too sweet gob of frosting (if it made it through the straw.) A place like this should be about the experience and the product. The experience wasn't hyped and the product fell short.,negative,restaurant
179856,First time I came here it was amazing 5 stars this time they ruined my sons ice cream by scratching there hair over his open cup of ice cream they then handed both my sons ice cream and my gingerbread pudding with ice cream full of sprinkles and hard balls and hard candies that I did not ask for I hate sprinkles and I do mean hate like they make me vomit so when I see this I ask the girl who took my order and she said it's only on top so I figure hey I can scrape it off I waited 20 mins and I know it's going to be good I start eating after I threw half ice cream away with sprinkles just to find out the stupid mess was all the way three and she lied about it!!!

It's a sundae so no mixing is involved so I don't understand that. Then when I got it, it was missing half the toppings that were listed in the description. Definitely not as good as people claim. Won't be going back.",negative,restaurant
180355,This was the first time my boyfriend and I tried this. We have lived in Pittsburgh our whole lives and have heard good reviews. The menu had plenty of options and looked awesome. I was torn between the chocolate chip sundae and the chocolate dip cone. I decided to get the dip cone but they said they had no chocolate left. This was at 7pm. I then asked for the sundae and they also had no chocolate chip cookies left. Whaaat!? Ugh. So I got a regular vanilla brownie sundae. The sundae was mostly vanilla and had one small brownie and very little chocolate syrup. I asked to add cherries which tasted different to me as well. I can sadly say I was disappointed in my Visit here and am truly not a picky eater. I wish they had possibly put a sign on the window that they were out of these ingredients before people ordered. My boyfriend did say he enjoyed his dirt sundae though. I don't think I will be returning unfortunately.,negative,restaurant
180466,"We used to love going to Mary Coyle. We'd even go there to buy a quart of ice cream to take home. However, lately their quality has gone downhill and their service is awful. We were warmly greeted when we walked in. However, our ice cream was served in small paper cups, not the nicer and larger glass cups they used to have. And only plastic spoons. The teens who were working were insensitive to the customers. They laughed and carried on such loud conversations that we couldn't hear each other across the table. We asked them to tone it down, but within a few minutes, they were loudly socializing with each other again. Don't they have things to do when there are no customers in line? The quality of the ice cream has deteriorated, too. The flavors are bland and lack the richness they used to have. There are so many ice cream shops in the area, that I can't imagine how Mary Coyle stays in business. It's been our go-to ice cream shop for many years, in the former location and now in this location. But we're crossing it off the list. Even the grocery-store ice cream is better.",negative,restaurant

We weren't offered samples & weren't acknowledged by the person running the register until we asked if we could order. Ice cream was only ""o.k"" - I doubt they make it in house. My boyfriend ordered a chocolate malt & received a vanilla one.

Why do I look so caramel cashew-y??? It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong! I didn't complain so my bad. I was mostly creeped out when he called me by name after looking at my credit card so I didn't want to point out his mistake.

180565,The place is terrible. Rude service punk kids. The now hiring sign was biggest sign i had ever seen in my life. The ice cream was just weird and it seemed like it was not the same as used to be when they were on 7 ave. Idk why they moved and down sized but maybe they should have just folded all together. The pink spoons they use were like rubber we couldnt even eat our ice cream with them. The sundea we got wasnt a sundea There was chocalate syrup everwhere but in it and the peanuts where whole and not even granulated after we asked if we could have some because they didnt put any on it. We got a cup of what looked like nasty old peanuts. Not one table was clean but on of the punk kids was cleaning windows lol with a wet rag. I though i was watching a play about an ice cream parlor. Completely bogus.,negative,restaurant

The flavors of ice cream were interesting: cannoli, birthday bash, a piece of cake, peanut butter cup, salted caramel, etc. lots of melted chocolate lay around for sale, as well as empty candy jars with no goods in them, despite their labels. The a/c unit dripped on us a whole bunch when we walked in. When I checked in on Yelp, it gives you the offer to have a free chocolate covered pretzel. So when the time came, we waited in line (there was only one very stressed young man working, he said his coworkers hadnt shown up, he hadn't had a break, and he'd been working all day. What gives?! We got a single scoop of peanut butter cup ice cream, in a plain small cone, price came out to be around 2.77 or something like that, couldn't remember the number and there was no where the prices for ice cream were listed. He didn't recognize the Yelp check in deal, but still honored it. The pretzel was super stale. Pretty not appetizing.",negative,restaurant

She held it out-of-the way with her bare hands which she was also using to scoop. I was amazed that the families that were present actually went ahead and purchased food. I didn't buy because I was too creeped out. I walked past again a few minutes later and she was repeatedly running her hand through it. Yikes.,negative,restaurant

180724,"Stopped in during Picklesburgh to pick up some treats since we were in town and don't have too many small bakeries where I am from. Everything LOOKED delicious but unfortunately that was basically where it ended. I attempted to verify with the person working that the cupcakes might withstand an approximate 3 hour drive. She confirmed that the icing was buttercream so it shouldn't melt with the exception of the red velvet cupcake and ""something else""... (the carrot cake cupcake because it's cream cheese based frosting, obviously..) we purchased a chocolate peanut butter cupcake (can't remember the exact name but it was something to the effect of peanut butter and chocolate) it was a completely chocolate cupcake, with chocolate filling and chocolate icing with a bit of crushed Reese's cups on top. Hardly peanut butter anything as reported by the person it was for. I shared a carrot cake cupcake with my significant other and while the cake part was moist and pretty good, the cream cheese frosting was almost unidentifiable. There was so much powdered sugar in the cream cheese frosting you could barely taste any cream cheese and the consistency was almost gritty. Very off putting and sickeningly sweetened. The truffle placed on top did not taste like anything and I was very unimpressed. It was reported to me by the person who ate it that the almond torte cupcake was good but a little melted. We also purchased edible cookie dough which, while it doesn't taste bad, I will probably be disposing of. The back of the package states it is shelf stable at room temperature for 60 days and 120 days refrigerated. Good in theory except for the fact there was no date on the cookie dough so I have no idea how long it already had sat out in the shop before I purchased it.",negative,restaurant

A sweet lady that worked there encouraged is to taste samples even though we said we weren't ordering until after lunch. When we returned after lunch, we were all set to order and since there was 6 of us, it was a lengthy process to get all of our ice cream. We also wanted fudge and they got annoyed and asked us to step aside. The ""head of production"" then charged us for fudge before we could order what we wanted and wouldn't adjust the transaction when we explained we wanted the buy 4 get 2 deal. She told us to pick a fudge and leave. If we wanted that deal, we would need to buy it again. Overall, it was sad to have that experience in such a nice shop. It wasn't even busy when we were trying to sort out the miscommunication. I won't return again.",negative,restaurant

Although the Ice Cream was delicious the scoops were small and expensive. $7.57 for two small scoops was not worth it. Lastly, the cashier was a little shady, I think he was attempting to scam me out of my change. After giving him a $20 for the $7.57 that I owed him, he gave me my receipt and then paused.

I have to say - I'm not particularly impressed. It pains me to say that because I really tried. The most lasting impression was a small cheesecake I tried a few weeks ago. The batch was so underdone that the bottom was soupy, which in turn made the crust (and the cake) inedible. When I went back a few days later, I mentioned it while pursuing the case to try something new. The woman behind the counter said she knew the batch was underdone. But no refund offer, replacement, or even an apology. Just an, ""We know."" I left with a bottle of wine and some cheese instead. There are other places to go for bakery items so maybe I'll try again after they've been settled for awhile.",negative,restaurant
181608,"I really wanted to like Hopscotch. The decor and ambiance is lovely, and I really like how you can purchase pieces from local artists and creators. However, the treats are rather lacking. I ordered a butterscotch cookie and a chocolate cupcake with strawberry frosting. For the quality, they are very overpriced. The chocolate cupcake, although pretty, was very lacking in any ""chocolate"" flavor, and honestly tasted similar to one from Schnucks. The frosting was okay. The cookie was better, but a little bit too tough. My jaw hurt after chewing. In addition, the customer service left something to be desired. The people at the counter seemed quite cool, almost judgmental. I hope Hopscotch will be able to improve their treats and cheer up a bit. Until then, I'll probably look somewhere else for coffee and dessert.",negative,restaurant
181762,"Ordered a crepe with strawberry banana and Nutella and have to be honest, I was slightly disappointed in the taste and quality. I think the venue itself made for a great atmosphere, however, the food didn't feel as amped as I was expecting it to be. My rating could also be a result of eating crepes in Europe and so my level of standard could be higher than the norm.",negative,restaurant
181779,"I have honestly never felt the need to review anything on here, but oh my god, my experience was absolutely terrible and I have never been so annoyed with a purchase. 1. The atmosphere is actually the worst thing I have ever come across, especially for a restaurant attempting to be trendy. Silver garland that changes color should stay at my great-aunt's Christmas party, not a restaurant. Mismatched wood wall accents EVERYWHERE make the place look like the designer stopped at a lumber liquidation sale and bought everything, whether it went together or not. The seashell tiling is atrocious and doesn't fit the vibe at all, if one can even call the aesthetic of this place a vibe. And who thinks velvet seating with RHINESTONES is okay for any restaurant that caters to anyone older than 6? And super limited seating, but I didn't want to stay in the place long enough to deal with it. 2. The wait was ridiculous for having ordered one basic crepe with absolutely no line in front of me. I had to stay in the hell hole way too long for comfort. 3. Finally, the food. It was mediocre, if I'm trying to be nice. My real issue was the pricing of it, though. You'd think that for $7.50 you'd at least get two scoops of ice cream. There's a little scoop of ice cream on the top, but it wasn't proportionate to the amount of crepe I had to eat. The crepe was shaped like an ice cream cone, so once the small amount of ice cream was eaten, you were left with a dry, plain crepe. Needless to say, I will not be returning. Please replace with a better restaurant, because I love crepes and would love to eat them regularly, but not at this place.",negative,restaurant

Then we looked into our box and one order was wrong, so we went back and ask for an exchange for the correct one. We got back attitude with NO sorry, got a response ""we just sold the last one"". Then I told her to refund our money, she was not happy. She told us to just wait (went on to serve other customers) and it took awhile to get our refund. She was rude, obnoxious and need to go back for more training in good customer service. No apology for getting it wrong at all and no apology for making us wait awhile to get our refund.",negative,restaurant
162028,I got the special! Orange creamsicle flavored soft serve. Comes topped w orange gummy bears. It tasted like orange sherbet that was shaped like soft serve. Defo not like an orange creamsicle. For $8.5 i feel like there should have been more richness or icecream-likeness. If I wanted orange sherbet I would go to walmart. I'll be trying one of their original blends next time.,neutral,restaurant

Unfortunately, this place just wasn't for me. The combination of ice cream and cereal was fun but overall nothing special. I would probably return to try again to see if I can find something more to my liking. The place is very Instagramable tho!

I tried to order a vegan ice cream swirl because this store is one of the only vegan ice cream options in Chandler! However, there was a grown man taking my order, which I would not expect for a boba and ice cream shop, so I thought that was strange. The man struggled to communicate with us and made my daughter very uncomfortable. Other than that, there was a really nice young girl making our ice cream and she did a great job! Overall, I am confused as to why a grown man would be working at a boba store where the main customers are younger teens. It made my daughter and I feel very uncomfortable.",neutral,restaurant
162132,"I saw a couple reviews that said they were out of the traditional black tapioca boba pearls when they went and unfortunately they were also out when I went today. They open at 11:30am and I had gotten there at noon. Seriously strange that a boba place would ""run out"" of boba pearls. I went with the ""crystal boba"" instead. Kind of disappointed. Tea was fine. For how large the drink was they were pretty stingy with the boba. If you're looking for traditional boba, I'd look elsewhere. If you want a super sweet mixed drink then this is your place. Prob won't be back.",neutral,restaurant
162159,"For boba drinks, it's only 3 stars worthy. The matcha tastes good, nothing amazing. The boba had a weird texture, seemed to be undercooked.. maybe if we tried the ice cream it would get better ratings. But I wouldn't recommend it for boba. Very aesthetic but not so tasty. We're boba fiends seeing as we have our own straws. BYOS!",neutral,restaurant
162206,"Pretty novel idea - mixing in fave breakfast cereals with ice cream - so it has a very familiar taste since they all have a vanilla ice cream base but is in that sweet treat realm. I had the Minion in shake form which was Frosted Flakes, banana and chocolate syrup all mixed together, which was pretty good. My son had a shake and had just Crunch Berries mixed in. On the plus side, it was a shake with Crunch Berries, on the downside, it was just vanilla ice cream, milk and Crunch Berries.... a little too close to just eating some breakfast cereal with milk. Good-ish but not great for the $5 I paid for it. If you go, choose one of their concoctions, you will definitely need a little more added to it than just cereal or it's gonna fall a little flat.",neutral,restaurant

Got my fiancÃ© a lobster tail and we got a regular cannoli to share. I think I'm just not a cannoli fan, this is easily the best cannoli I ever had but they are just not for me. I appreciate that they took the criticism from countless other people and stocked the most popular stuff, they had two trays of cannoli and lobster tail. Service was still pretty weak and not friendly, but hey 3 stars is a huge improvement over the 1 star I gave it 6 months ago.",neutral,restaurant
162439,"I love watching Cake Boss, so I was excited to try this place at the Venetian. I came here with my mom, and we ordered a cannoli and lobster tail. I was a fan of the lobster tail and its flaky pastry and cream, which was not too sweet. The cannoli wasn't bad, but I found the filling to be heavy for my taste and I wish the shell was not so hard. Overall, the pastries that I tried were good, but there are many other bakeries in town that have better treats for much lower prices. Not to mention, the line was very long (we came on a weekday night and it's often a lot longer on weekends), and after ordering, it took quite some time for our order to come out, especially since we only ordered a few pastries from the display cases and a coffee.",neutral,restaurant

Quality keeps you coming back for more no matter what price.",neutral,restaurant

Cons: 1) Line was long and slow moving and not well organized. 2) Product description does not tell you which ones have nuts and which don't. 3) Staff did not seem knowledgable when questioned about their products and gave incorrect info. Pros: 1) You can watch bakers at work while waiting in line. 2) The prices were not as outrageous as I would have expected from a TV famous bakery. 3) Staff was friendly. Will update when we eat the baked goods.,neutral,restaurant
162513,"I have to say I am 100% Italian and I really wanted to love this place because I watch Cake Boss and i love the show. After I FINALLY found the bake shop, it was really small. The selection was limited and geared more for the Vegas tourist not authentic. I asked if they had a pasticiotta, and the girl taking orders looked at me like I was cross eyed. After I explained to her what it was she apologized. It looks like the bakery had more American features like cupcakes, cake slices, etc which is not traditional at all. It was really Americanized. I ordered cannoli, an eclair, and a sfogliatelle. The cannoli were good. The eclair was dry, barely any cream inside. The sfogliatelle was average. Nothing to write home about. I will stick to the bakeries in CT. Maybe the bakery in Jersey is better, but this was needs some help.",neutral,restaurant

I give 3 stars because we're still a big fan of the pastries and of Buddy but that guy needs to go.. ASAP",neutral,restaurant
162591,This place was really busy with a line out the store which made choosing a little tricky as people were standing directly in front of the case. In the end decided to go for a cheesecake which was definitely tasty although quite expensive for the size.,neutral,restaurant

162634,"Somewhat hard to find as there is minimal signage in the hotel that helps. 15 minute wait total (not bad) which I was prepared for and the staff was nice and answered questions about pricing (since there was none posted). You had to ask for the cannoli because there weren't any in the front case. They tasted good. The pastry was crisp-fragrant with vanilla and the cream rich with pops of chocolate chips. I thought the cream puffs were just ok. We have a New York style bakery were I'm from and their cream puffs are so delicious so I naturally compared the two and was a bit let down. $10 got me a cannoli, cream puff and coffee. I'm glad I visited because I was a fan of the family show. I may try some other things if I come back.",neutral,restaurant
162635,"Well we just ate at Carlo's and it was good. Not as pricy as one may expect. I did get to leave with both my arms intact. The Lobster tail was inhaled by my wife and the cannoli was eaten like a boss by my best bud. If you want to be in a sugar comma I suggest you come here. The doughnut did taste like a sweet 16 you would buy at your local supermarket but hey it did the job! So I would like to say to everyone.. "" to the box truck baby!""",neutral,restaurant
162650,"We came while visiting the Venetian. As soon as I saw the signs I took off running looking for this bakery. When we got here there was only a few people and it was a little confusing at first because there was two lines. I found out that one was for ordering and the other to pay when called. We got the eclair, lobster tail, and chocolate fudge cupcake. Sadly, there was a sign up that said there was no cannoli(s) available. Overall, the whole process was about 10 minutes or so from start to finish. It was a little pricey and I also didn't like the fact some items weren't labeled. It was 3.95 for an eclair the size of my thumb. so when we tried the pastries, it was ok. I mean it wasn't fantastic. The eclair didn't taste like much and the cupcake was a little dry. I was hoping for flavor but there wasn't much of it. The lobster tail was the best thing even though it was a 6 dollar pasty. The pastry cream wasn't too sweet which was nice but there was SO much of it inside that it spilled out and was kinda gross after that.",neutral,restaurant

On a Thursday night, quite a wait, figured I'd get a wide range of their offerings: Oreo tower cake, pretty, but tasted like it had been on the shelf for awhile. Lobster Tail: Unique and tasty, can't get it anywhere else, nice for a pic. Pecan Wedge: Best thing I got, shortbread with pecans/syrup partially dipped in chocolate. On a Sunday morning: Not a long wait, but no lobster tails or pecan wedges available. Seemed like much of the items were holdovers from the previous night.",neutral,restaurant

I will try them again but will ask when they were made before purchasing.,neutral,restaurant
162661,Came here around 10 AM Sunday - no line. The set up is not too ideal because you place your order with the lady behind the glass counter halfway through the line and can't really see all of the other items further in the back of the store. Pastries and mini cakes are more in the front whereas cupcakes are further in the back. So don't stand in line first. First view all of the available items by going in between the sitting area and lined off section and then decide what you want. Then wait in line. Once you place your order you wait in the shop until they call your name/number and then you go up and pay. Tried the lobster tail and mini canoli. The cream was nice in both as they weren't too sweet. I felt the dough though in both were ok.,neutral,restaurant
162686,I came to Carlo's Bakery with my family expecting to have a good experience. The reviews for this bakery were positive so we decided to try.

Food was delicious but the service was poor. Would not come again.,neutral,restaurant
162692,"Tried the cannoli, Lobster tail, and glazed chocolate donut. Their flavors are very ordinary overall my favorite was the Lobster tail. I don't think this is the best bakery but it's okay.

Clever in design and diverse in craft with cakes, cannoli, cookies by the pound and more sold in the Italian tradition of tickets and hand bills Carlo's problems begin at the door where several starry eyed customers forget tickets in the face of photo-ops and proceeding to the counter the issue is multiplied by mislabeled product, the fledgling staff all the more confused with items frequently forgotten by many early reports - in my case a $3 creampuff for which I was charged but never received. Moving next to the product, prices not substantially different from the east coast flagship but still dramatically inflated given the name on the door, my tasting began with a pair of pre-filled cannolis and with sog already setting in suffice it to say better can be had at Montesano's for half the price, any true Italian realizing filled-to-order is the only way to go. Admittedly disappointed but moving on to more, a duo of $3.50 cupcakes smaller and far less inspiring than Sprinkles or Bouchon would follow and proceeding to a duo of forgettable cookies I was thankful when three forms of puff pastry finally proved memorable - the fresh-cut Napoleon I'd watched the team layer, frost, and cut in the kitchen a flaky masterpiece and the still-warm cinnamon strudel danish a pastry well worth the five bucks. Obviously new and clearly capable of sustaining a few bumps in the road on the backs of adoring fans it will be interesting to see just how long Buddy and team can ride the initial wave of hype, but featuring the only legitimate Italian Bakery on the strip I'm sure they'll be around long enough to justify waiting to visit unless one is a true fan - and even then I'd suggest anyone with transportation visit Freed's or Montesano's first.",neutral,restaurant
162721,"I just don't understand why they would make this place so small?? They know the one in Hoboken is popular, so why wouldn't they make the one in Las Vegas bigger? The pastries were good but they got our order wrong. We ordered 2 cookies, a strawberry cheesecake and a lobster tail. They gave us 2 loster tails and the cookies. They tasted good but the cookies were hard as a rock (I think they were coffee cookies) we might be back and hopefully we will have a better experience",neutral,restaurant

We've been to Las Vegas several times before during the weekends where the line was so long I didn't want to wait. Finally went during the week and got 3 cupcakes and the lobster tail pastry. The cupcakes did not disappoint. They were very moist, but frosting was great as well, but a little too sweet for me and my boys. Now let's get to the lobster tail... that was a disappointment. It was a flaky pastry and the filling was creamy but bland and no flavor. I might try out the cupcakes again the next time we're in the area.",neutral,restaurant
162739,"Can I put 3.5 stars? The baked goods were decent. We got a whole bunch of biscotti and some miscellaneous breakfast pastries. I would say that the breakfast pastries we got, an apple turnover and some sort of lemon butter crumb pastry were both extremely good. If I was rating this place just on the quality of those two things, i would say 5 stars all the way. We tried another kind of cookie thing with hazelnut on it, and it was just okay for me. The really bad part about this place, the price, gruff service, and to a lesser extent, the confusion of the madness. Walking up, there were two huge lines, so which one do we get in? Nobody had a clue. Turns out, one was the line to order, and one line was to pay. Not a very intuitive process, since the line to pay looked like it was properly roped off as if it were the starting point. Get some signs! Service was relatively quick, but they sure weren't very nice. We were buying stuff for ourselves and stuff for someone else, so we asked for separate boxes. Yea, that didn't seem to go very well with the person taking the order. Annoyed look on her face. Actually, that annoyed look was on all the workers faces. And finally, the price. Wow! At the end of the day, it was probably our fault that we bought too much biscotti, but all in all we spent $50 for a couple pastries, a cookie, and maybe a bag of biscotti that in a normally overpriced environment (if that makes sense) would still only be $20. If I could get the breakfast pastries ($5 each) without waiting in line, I would do it. Unrelated, I am definitely interested in trying the Buddy V's restaurant, also by Carlo.",neutral,restaurant

It took us about an hour or so to get in last night and when we finally did we were served by a very friendly set of employees. We bought a mini chocolate cannoli, a pastry called a lobster tail, a cheesecake, and a Carmel cupcake. The best of the 4 was the lobster tail, it is a crunchy pastry filled with a cream that was definitely enjoyable. The cannoli was very gritty and I will probably not purchase it again if I were to return. The Carmel cupcake was mediocre at best and not worth the wait when there are places that specialize in amazing cupcakes all around the strip. The cheesecake was good, but for $11 you can get that anywhere on the strip at a larger size and better quality.

The comments on the service is true though, it is a bit slow. They take your order but they expect you to know exactly what you want when you get to the counter, and then they make you pay while they take time to package everything. While I was there; the selection seemed slim. They had maybe 4 different cupcakes, 3 variety of sugar cookies, and then 4 different regular cookies. They had very limited amounts of Neapolitan and Canonolis. The price is a little expensive, but keep in mind it is Vegas! $3.50~ for cupcakes and cookies each. Fancier desserts around $7-8, and any sort of Cheesecake $15. All of the desserts were pretty good though. I didn't have any complaints. Their cake resembles more of a ""butter pound cake"" taste versus the cakes you would normally get at the store. **TIP: Check online for their Cake of the Week! Only $20 for a full cake which is a really good deal for this place!**",neutral,restaurant

163464,Cupcakes were ok. Not great. They weren't dry which I was happy about. I just didn't think they had much flavor. The frosting was better than the cupcake itself. Place was packed. I expected it to be better being how popular it was and with Buddy being on Cake Boss on The Food Network. Another con was he way the line was set up. If it wasn't for a guy telling another person next to him how it worked I wouldn't have known that I had to order in one line and pick up in the other so that makes it slightly awkward and haphazard. Overall the place has a good family vibe to it. Would I go back? Not really. But if I were to have never tried a cupcake from Carlo's bakery in NJ then this is a good alternative.,neutral,restaurant
163480,Pastries were very good but they had no prices on any of them. Was a little shocked when They told me the total. Only got to see how much everything was when I got the receipt. This was the reason for the 3 stars.,neutral,restaurant
163502,"Stopped in for a pastry and coffee. Wanted to try the famous lobster tails. The ordering process seemed a little chaotic? Stood in line to order from someone with an iPad and then stand in another line to get our order?? Lastly, after we got our order there was no one to sit and enjoy it?? Walked a good distance outside to the patio at the Pallazio to eat my pastry and drink my not so hot coffee. Little disappointed in the experience I was looking forward to!",neutral,restaurant
163506,"Original lobster tail all the way! But, everything else seemed like it might just be the hype? Stuff was very pretty/yummy looking but we weren't fans of the cookie we got and the cannoli was just okay. If the wait isn't too bad, I'd say get in on those lobster tails but otherwise, there are so many places to get treats, this one isn't necessarily worth the time or money.",neutral,restaurant
163514,"After hearing such great things about Carlo's Bake Shop from friends, I decided that this was on the top of my to do list in Vegas. Some people gamble, some people drink-- I EAT. Carbs don't count on vacation right? This review comes from someone who does not watch Cake Boss. While I love, love, love cooking shows and competitions (Food Network is my jam), I just never could get into Cake Boss. My friends always rant and rave about the show, and now the bakery, so I decided that I needed to know what the hype was about. After walking around the Venetian Canal Shops, following the signs to the bakery (and Buddy V's located across the way) I finally spotted the hallway that was pretty busy with people. In some of the Yelp photos, it looks like a zoo-- but maybe I got lucky, because it wasn't THAT bad. There was a line and it took maybe 15 minutes to get to the front of the line. There was someone who was monitoring the line which was nice because he actually stopped people that were trying to cut in line. The line waits in front of the kitchen where you can watch them decorate cakes and such. At the time, they were working on a cannoli towers. They looked great so I was sold! I had to pick one up. Once you get into the actual bakery and they take your order, it turns into a frenzy of customers looking into the cases trying to decide what to get. The lady in front of me was going back and forth trying to figure out which biscotti's to get. I think that a menu with pictures of the items for sale would do this place wonders! It would be helpful to see a menu so that when you get to the front of the line, you already know what you want to order. There were no lobster tails in the case, so I opted for a box of Christmas cookies that was already prepackaged, a few cookies and a cannoli tower. My order ran about $40 bucks. $40 dollars and an hour later, and all I could think was ""MEH"". It didn't live up to the hype in my book. The cannoli tower was decent, but I thought it was rather soggy and not as rich or flavorful as I was expecting. The biscotti was alright, but it wasn't something that I would wait in line for again. The box of cookies were a gift, but the recipient opened the box after dinner and we did try one of the butter cookies and it was okay. Definitely not as rich as other butter cookies that I have had from less popular bakeries. If you are a fan of the show, I can see why you would come here. But if you are like me and just wanted a good cannoli, I would keep looking.",neutral,restaurant
163525,"After all sting dinner at their restaurant we walked across the hall to this place. My husband and I have been looking forward to trying Buddy's desserts. There was a bit of a wait but everyone was very organized and helpful which made the experience smooth. I gave this bakery three stars because the desserts weren't as good as we thought they'd be. Prices were also way too high! The cream puff was awesome! However, the cookies and salted caramel cupcake we purchased were very bland. We don't like super sweet treats but these had almost no flavor and having some sweetness would have been helpful. I totally hate to give a three star review but in all honesty we won't be returning.",neutral,restaurant
163530,"My friend wanted to try this place out due to her love for the show (I don't watch it but don't kill me). Waiting wasn't a huge issue, although it was very crammed when we went so I thought ""wow it must be that good."" You are not required to fall in line, you just take a number & wait for it to be called by the workers & they are happy to help you. What was a little annoying was that it was so crammed that everyone's basically standing around in this tiny bakery & we could barely see the other desserts since it was very hard to move. Also, my friend really wanted to come here originally just for cannoli but we didn't see any. When we finally got our number called, my friend ordered a bunch of desserts and the ones I did get to try were the coconut macaroons, the cheesecake, and the napoleon. We did ask if there were any cannolis but he said not today so were a bit disappointed cuz I really wanted a cannoli also! Anyways, after the worker helps you, you are told to wait again to pay. They call your number for that too so again, no waiting in line. Just kinda gotta awkwardly crowd around. Coconut macaroons (3.5/5) - they charge per pound for this. I was a little annoyed that the worker didn't know how much they charged by the pound but know the bakery is pretty new so I cut him some slack. She ordered half a pound which came out to be $11.95. I'm not a huge fan of these macaroons, but I admit they were pretty good. They were drizzled in chocolate which added a nice touch to it. But overall wasn't too impressed. Cheesecake (3.5/5) - I'm guessing these ran about $9 something a piece since her total for two was around $19. Definitely did not taste like it was worth that much. It was topped with a chocolate looking whipped cream and a large dark chocolate covered strawberry. To me it just tasted like cheesecake. I did like the consistency though, it was very smooth. The strawberry tasted way too over-ripe & it didn't complement the dark chocolate in any way. Again, nothing too special about it. Napoleon (3.5/5) - I have had better but this was my favorite out of the three desserts. Nice and flakey yet a little stale but I really love napoleons so I got past that. This cost $6.95 for a slice. The packaging is cute and it's probably what also takes them a while since they are still new. Overall, the desserts weren't horrible it's just that I was wow'd by any of them. I don't think I'll be coming back here just for that bakery but if I happen to be at the Venetian, I'll consider stopping by. Hopefully there will be cannolis!",neutral,restaurant
163553,"A seemingly popular small bakery in the Venetian with several delicious-looking pastries, cakes, cupcakes, cannoli, etc. The ordering process is fairly stressful. You line up on one side to make your selections from the glass cases, then line up on the other side to pay and receive your loot (which must be eaten elsewhere, as there is no seating in the bakery itself). We ordered a cannoli, a sugar cookie, and the pumpkin cheesecake. All were respectable but by no means mind-blowing. I would love to try one of the cakes next time, which at $35 per cake, seemed to be the best deal in Las Vegas.",neutral,restaurant
163572,"I was enthusiastic about visiting the bakery. My wife, my daughter and I went to get some cake for my birthday. I love Caramel Cake. We tried the Salted Caramel and was politely let down. The cake was fresh and moist but the Caramel flavor was lacking. I have had some absolutely amazing Caramel Cakes so I was looking to be wowed by the cake at Carlo's. It is a good cake but nothing spectacular. On a final note they do not offer a discount for locals. I think they should offer a discount to locals that decide to patronize the businesses on the Strip like many other businesses.",neutral,restaurant
163612,"As a huge fan of Buddy and his family for many years, I was quite excited to try Carlo's. I ordered a slice of cake since he's the Cake Boss. As many reviews have noted, the order/pay system is very slow and disorganized...contributing to long lines and even longer wait times. Only one person ordering ahead of me on a Tuesday morning,and and yet it took 15 minutes. Next comes the sticker shock: $9.95 for a small piece of cake. I know it's Vegas, but this price makes it prohibitive for families. A family of 4 would drop $40 just for cake. One family in line left with their kids in tears because they simply couldn't afford it. The quality was good, but way too much artificial color in order to create a bright red / bright green cake. It was fun to eat at Carlo's ONCE. But I won't be back. Be prepared to wait even if they aren't busy...and be prepared to pay steep prices.",neutral,restaurant
163768,"Trendy, artsy, fartsy place. Cake was dry to say the least. Drink selection rather limited. Go with a small group. Wear your favorite Bernie t-shirt",neutral,restaurant

163790,"3.5 stars. I think the biggest benefit to The Butterwood Bake Consortium is that it's open late. Most bakeries close early and so if you're like me and get a late night sweet tooth- Butterwood is here for you. The other good things- really intricate decorations- wallpaper on the wall, lots of rich golds and maroons, and comfy seating. Almost like an old classy mansion. My husband and I ordered a piece of chocolate cake w/blackberry mascarpone buttercream. It was very dense- definitely enough to split, and overall I wouldn't say it's the best cake I've ever had, it was okay. Also- the price was high, about $7 total. We did have to wait a bit because there was only one person working and a few people in line in front of us (about 9pm on a Friday). The girl working was very apologetic and nice. Overall, I'd recommend going to experience the ambiance and try something new.",neutral,restaurant
163800,"Walking in, I felt like I had been transported into one of those British bake shops where you can can hang out with your girlfriends for hours around cake and lattes. That's exactly what I did. I absolutely loved this quaint little place and they had plenty of comfortable seating. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 4 is the simple chocolate cake we ordered was a tad dry and the buttercream was hardened. It was as if the cake had been sitting out too long in the fridge and it was almost to the point of being stale. I've heard people rave about their delicious cakes so I'm going to assume we just got there on a day of a bad batch. The latte's we got were fine, nothing too special. I definitely loved the atmosphere and its a great little place to meet up with a few of your friends. Sure it was pricey for the subpar cake I had, but I want to come back and try it again to give this place a 2nd chance.",neutral,restaurant
163827,"I love their cakes and the staff is so nice and accommodating! However I had to bump my review down after my 2nd visit because I realized that all the cakes taste the same... So I bring my friends here, hyping up this bakery as I normally do. We all got a poppy seed rose cake with chocolate buttercream and couldn't finish the slice (just like the last time). I thought that the taste was the same as the slice I had last time, I couldn't taste the rose at all. It just tasted like vanilla cake with chocolate buttercream - but I dismissed it. So then I got really excited when they brought out a newly made raspberry cake with ricotta cheese icing. So...naturally I bought both. You'd think they'd taste different right?? Wrong! They tasted exactly the same...I don't know how, but it tasted exactly like a vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream with no raspberry or ricotta. Disappointed by the wasted splurge, but enjoyed every bite of the cake!",neutral,restaurant
163875,"Came here late on a Saturday night after dinner at another place on Butler. It's one of the only options for late night sweet treats. The dÃ©cor is cute and I'm sure could be better appreciated during the day. There is ample space to sit, chat and enjoy the baked goods. The selection is pretty small, but understandable for a small establishment. I got the carrot spice mini cakes that had sugary icing. The cake itself is pretty mild. I thought it was a bit expensive, especially compared to other bakeries ($4.28). The cashier is a bit reserved...my friend commented that she is ""not too friendly.""",neutral,restaurant
163899,"Came in around 9pm and the place was still busy, more of a quiet hipster crowd with a unique sense of style. We got a piece if chocolate cake to share which was very good, nothing to run back for but good. My wife got tea which ended up being tazo tea, I thought it would be something more non commercial but she said it was good. I on the other hand got a small french press coffee that tasted gross. It's a cool little place but I wouldn't tell my friend you have to try it.",neutral,restaurant
163963,"Great place to get that creamy, rich yummy homemade ice cream! There's no store front persay, it's more like a window walk up. You walk up, order than wait for your treat. Outdoor seating only. They offer an abundance of ice cream plus sherbet options. We've tried the pecan praline, salted caramel, banana foster, blue monster, chocolate and oree. All were delicious. We got a small and medium (2 flavors) in a waffle cone. And one banana split. Service is ridiculously sloooooooooooow. So if you see it's a line, that's why. Average to high price. However you get great quality creamy ice cream. Overall positive experience.",neutral,restaurant

164254,My review is more based on the customer service. Ice cream is delicious and the location is nice. The young kids working this place truly need to smile when dealing with a big amount of customers. There attitudes alone can drive away service.,neutral,restaurant
164413,"I went for two buck tuesday at around 3, so there were many kids and their parents in line since they had just gotten off school. Two registers were open. I asked the cashier at mine if I could try a flavor (whatever the monthly special was) and he said ""we're not doing taste tests because of the super long line."" I hear another customer ask for a sample to the other cashier, and she says yes. I just comply with what my cashier told me and get my usual flavor, salted caramel. I ask for it in a cone but to also give me a cup since salted caramel is usually very melty. He gives me the ice cream, I pay, then walk off. I finally decide to look at the receipt when I get home and find that he charged an extra quarter for the cone. For some reason, I thought cones were included in two buck tuesday. Maybe it's because i asked for it with a cup. Anyhow, i won't be coming back to this handel's on a tuesday because the cashiers seem moody.",neutral,restaurant
164632,Decent ice cream. Good selection of flavors and generous with the mix ins. Lines can get long and sometimes they seem understaffed with only one window open. The guy I think is the owner/manager could use a refresher on his customer service skills. Can be pretty short with customers. I go there when bored with Ben & Jerry's flavors.,neutral,restaurant
164643,"Visiting from CA! The interior is cute and seems like a popular place to study/bring the aunties to lounge and converse. Decorations and ambience is 5/5. As for the actual food and drinks....let me begin with the drinks! I am a big Italian Creme Soda Girl and I loved every sip of my Peaches and Creme soda!!!! It is basically fresh milk with carbonated water/soda and peach purÃ©e. 10/5. I loved it so much and was sad that I finished it so fast. The iced coffee was eh my little sister drank it but wasn't raving (she loves Dunkin' Donuts vanilla coffee)....and now for the pastries...We both love Honey + Butter (macaroon specialty shop in SoCal). Upon seeing the flavors and the macaroons on display we opted not to get any. The flavors were a bit basic, but I am sure they are a classic macaroon, just not up to the standard of creativity and presentation that is offered back home. We got the peaches and creme tart instead and the raspberry merengue one. They weren't bad but it was a bit underwhelming. I would say pass on those and get the macaroons or like the strawberry fruit tart before going for those. I will give the pastries we tried a 2/5. It looked better than it tasted, which is a common bummer for many bakeries, not just this one! But still it was underwhelming enough for me to bump two stars because I really went to this place to try the baked goods with ambience as a plus but it was really vice versa-- Overall, will I be back if I ever go back to NC? If I am in the area then yes I will come back for the peaches and Creme soda, then YOU BET. But then again I can make my own from this side of the ocean so it was a good experience and I took some nice photos for the memories!",neutral,restaurant
164702,"Amelies has a great atmosphere and delicious pastries. Only reason for 3 stars is there food is just okay. I tried their tomato soup which was probably the worst tomato soup I've had in some time- more so resembled a salsa then soup, which was disappointing. I recommend sticking to their sweet options!",neutral,restaurant
164726,"This was the second time I have been here but first time reviewing. Amelie is a very cute and interesting place. With so many pastries to go and a few gluten free options, which makes me happy. The fact that they stay open 24/7 is great. They offer gluten free bread for breakfast sandwiches, so obviously I went with that. The bread was buttery and held it's own very well. On the sandwich I ordered egg, bacon, cheddar, spinach and tomatoes. Everything was good until I realized they forgot my bacon, by then we were on the road already. My husband had a croissant which he thought was perfect. Coffee was delicious and we took some pastries to go, including the famous gluten free salted caramel brownie.",neutral,restaurant
164748,"Was looking for a place to have a relaxing lunch with some girlfriends and this wasn't really it. This is a counter service restaurant and the line was really long. However, a long line is usually a sign of a good restaurant so we waited. There was an extensive case of pastries and macaroons to look at while in line and as someone who is gluten free I appreciate that they had gluten free pastry and bread options. I ordered a sandwich once I reached the register. Unfortunately, this did not end our wait. We were not given a number and allowed to find a table. We had to stand there and wait for our food which took a good 20 minutes. By the time I got my food the canned soda I had ordered was warm. I ordered the chicken, sun-dried tomato and goat cheese sandwich. Flavor was good, spinach was fresh but it was just a bad piece of chicken -- really tough and gristly. Not the relaxing lunch experience we were looking for. In addition, the amount of packaging this place uses is ridiculous. I would recommend them asking if the order is for here or to go so every orders not packed in plastic containers and paper bags.",neutral,restaurant
164781,"I have been a fan of amelies for years, I usually never complain but I have to say....since covid it's not the same...the pastries are just ""okay"" tasting although they are still pretty and the attitude behind the counter is terrible...what a shame...plus they aren't open late anymore or abolle to sit inside.... I used to go weekly multiple times a day pre covid...now I've been 3 times since covid hit and the disappointment is just too great. Now I have to hunt for a new pastry and tea late night hide out spot.",neutral,restaurant
164806,"The first time I came here years ago I absolutely loved this place, but my most recent visit was lacking. It's a fun spot with a really interesting atmosphere and a beautiful display case of pastries. We got a myriad of treats to try and my husband also got a latte. I really wanted to try one of their lattes but can't have caffeinated coffee, unfortunately for me they don't have decaf espresso so I didn't get to try one. My husband really enjoyed his though. I tried a bite of nearly everything and it was all so sweet. I eat baked goods a lot so I expect them to be sweet, but these were so sugary I just couldn't stomach much of it. They were all good but far from the best I've had. The tables were littered with crumbs and hadn't been cleaned, which is a little off putting. The service behind the counter was helpful and prompt. I would say it's worth checking out if you're visiting and wanting to do something unique.",neutral,restaurant
164838,"Good egg sandwiches although expensive. Good counter service. Salted caramel brownie was old, stale, took a bite then had to throw out, dry too. Next time I'd try something else but I'd recommend trying this first before you walk away, I should've returned it. That one got past quality control.",neutral,restaurant
164842,"I don't get the hype for this place! I think their food is pretty mediocre - not very vegetarian-friendly, definitely not vegan-friendly, and sub-par pastries. Now, French pastries aren't my favorite, but I do know what they're supposed to taste like I don't think Amelie's totally hits the mark. I think some of people's favorites are things I don't eat (breakfast sandwiches, for example), so who knows. It's usually pretty crowded regardless of the time of day which isn't ideal, but if you need a coffee shop to work in past 7pm, this is the spot for you.",neutral,restaurant
164904,"Food is great, but service has gotten terrible over the past 6+ months. We tend to call ahead for orders to-go and we actually take bets on the order being either screwed up or not even made by the time we get there (or the staff outright forgetting to make it and apologizing when we get there). This has happened at least 4 out of the 6 times we've come here. I hope AmÃ©lie's fixes their to-go order process and has more attention to detail. The staff is super friendly and polite, but this doesn't really address the issue.",neutral,restaurant

Year's ago they had the best staff and I love how they help people who have records. I just think the food doesn't taste the same the soup doesn't coat the spoon. I used to come in late night with 5-10 people when we would get off of work. Now not so much. It seems like the love is gone.,neutral,restaurant

165300,"Really good food, very quick service BUT my complaint is-if you are a lunch place have enough seats for those that want to eat NOT those that need a place to work for the day. Visiting from NY, went for a quick lunch with sibling who works in the area. We had to wait for another lunch table to leave before we could sit - as we looked around - everyone around us had one cup of coffee in front of them, no food. There were actually multiple tables of 3-4 people that were working, not eating therefore not spending money. Please put a time-limit on tables or ask the ""squatters"" to vacate the tables during lunch hours. Will go back, but never for lunch.",neutral,restaurant
165328,The salted caramel brownie was nice: a modest sized chocolatey brick thats halfway between a brownie and fudge capped with a generous layer of slightly salty caramel that's not overbearingly sweet. The mixed berry fruit tart was just alright: a standard crust filled with slightly baked fresh fruit that was refreshing indeed with a subtle custard filling.,neutral,restaurant

165353,"The pastries are just ok... Their pastries used to be much better, but the attention to detail has suffered with their growing popularity. Now it seems like their pastries are quickly mass produced, which is sad because I used to think they were the best bakery in Charlotte. The tarts look sad with clumsily plopped on fruit and gelatinous clumps of glace. A lot of their pastries - like croissants, cake, anything with choux, palmiers, etc. are often slightly overdone. Overall, even though most everything tastes ok, it all seems to lack finesse. I'm not expecting Sadaharu Aoki, but a little thoughtfulness can go a long way.",neutral,restaurant

It is also a great place to sit down and catch up with friends which was exactly what I was doing. This place is packed! Good for them of course but it was difficult to lock in a seat of 2 even at 3pm. I shared a fruit tart with a friend and it was good. It was not the best fruit tart I have ever had in my life but I did enjoy it. If the small cupcake sized fruit tart was closer to $3 instead of $5 I would probably come here a lot more often. Unfortunately, not everybody is a Heisenberg (Breaking Bad Reference).",neutral,restaurant

Highly recommend Caramel Salted Brownie if you're going to get dessert.,neutral,restaurant
165435,"I'm giving it a 3/5 stars because the cake I purchased tasted like it had been refrigerated too long. I would suggest calling ahead a few days to have a cake made, which was my stupid mistake.

My boss actually bought some pastries from Amelies that were pretty good which prompted this cake purchase. Not the biggest fan but there are some goodies at this bakery.",neutral,restaurant

Overall quality is below average for a major market, but above average for Charlotte, so take that for what it is worth.",neutral,restaurant

165465,"I am a Pastry Arts Major, so I might be more critical than an average customer. I was overwhelmed when I first arrived to Charlotte and I loved it, but over the years I have realized the quality of the goods are bit slacking. By far, the salted caramel brownie is amazing and is always my go to dessert. It is never bad, never slacking, and always satisfying. Recently I have been exploring some other treats in the display cabinet and I am a bit disappointed. All my non-culinary friends love it, but I can see that some of the products could be amazing. For example the croissants are just not reaching the standard for my liking. The employees are amazing, the location is amazing, and the amount of seating is wonderful. Even if you can't find seating in the main building, there is extra seating outside as well as in the atrium in the back. I have been at many different times of the day and always can find a seat. I give it 3 stars because I can't get past the quality of the desserts .The food, however, may be the most underestimated part of the restaurant. The soup is to die for, especially the carrot ginger, and the cheese spread are amazing. To end I can't forget to mention that it is open 24 hours, 7 days a week. It is an amazing place to visit with a group or by yourself. You must people watch at different parts of the day because the crowd changes depending on what time you are there.",neutral,restaurant

Quite literally, because Amelie's never closes. It's open 24/7. If there were anything they do really well, that would be it. I have to say, however, that the quality has gone down. When I go nowadays, I'm not surprised when I get a not-so-fresh or burned eclair. It's par for the Amelie's course. And then there are all of the hipsters. You'll need to scour the premises for somewhere to sit because these guys have taken up every seat in the place. Can be a little annoying when you just need somewhere to park it for 10 mins. But no, you must inhale your baked good and coffee and then move on with life. They have coffee, tea, sandwiches, soups, and plenty of sweets. If you get a craving around 6pm, wait 5 hours and then go to Amelie's - less people to fight through for mediocre pastries.",neutral,restaurant
165627,"Amelies is one of my favorite places to go in the Charlotte area. It is different, always open, and I love to go just to try something new. My only concern is that it could be cleaner. Almost every time I have ever been to Amelies the tables haven't been cleaned. My only suggestion would be to have someone constantly sweeping and wiping down tables or just checking the atrium/inside for dirty floors and tables. Honestly who wants to eat somewhere that doesn't feel clean? I also wonder about how long some of the treats are sitting in the display. I went yesterday and ordered a croissant from the display and it was dry and hard. I also tried four different macaroons but all except for one tasted like it had been sitting for a while so it had a weird and stale after taste. Great idea in this place but needs way more of a managerial touch.",neutral,restaurant
165677,"Who knew there were hipsters in the south? My favorite part of Amelie's is the decor; with all the vintage/industrial furniture and dark woods, it's someplace I could spend a few hours studying, sipping coffee, and eating pastries. In my opinion, Amelie's best baked goods are the croissant (and any variation of) and baguette. The blueberry and apple tart were disappointing, too sour and the crust didn't have much flavor at all. I'll be back to try some of the other goods, but for now I give Amelie's a 'Meh'.",neutral,restaurant
165706,"I'm giving this place three stars because of the love that the people in Charlotte have for this place but I'm from New Orleans and I have a very high standard taste for French bakery and this place doesn't really fit my taste, and it is way overpriced but Great place to hang out and drink coffee and meet new people",neutral,restaurant
165729,"I'm a baker (it's my favorite hobby!) so I'm very critical of desserts. I bought a slice of cake here and my reaction was just ""meh"". The dessert was good, but not impressive. I wish I had tried more desserts (a sampler would be the bee's knees!!) but the prices were too high for me to do so. (No complaints about the prices, they were what I expected.) The staff was extremely friendly, the decor was eclectic, and the furniture was clean enough.",neutral,restaurant

165751,"In short: good food, decent prices, line takes a while of they're busy I stopped by Amelies on a friends recommendation while visiting Charlotte. I'm not a very big dessert/pastry person, nor had I ever really had French food, so it felt like a weird choice, but it was quite good. The line was quite long when I arrived (1:30pm on a Saturday). While in line, you go ahead and order whatever pastries you want, then at the front of the line you order drinks/other food and pay for everything. I ordered a spinach asiago tartine ($6) and a pistachio opera torte ($5). Both were good, but the tartine was barely warm by the time it reached me, which was disappointing. Finding a place to sit inside was difficult; I didn't check the outside seating at all. The atmosphere is nice. I needed a place to just sit and rest a bit before I could go to my hotel, and Amelies was perfect for that.",neutral,restaurant
165769,Exceptional savory and dessert selections. Absolutely the worst ordering sequence on the planet.

Came specifically to this location for the flavor of bread pudding that day. Noel took my order and proceed to work on my computer. Bread pudding arrives and it's the wrong flavor. Took it back to the counter and she apologized and put another in the over for me. No biggie. But 40 mins go by and the correct bread pudding came. Go back and Noel says the kitchen forgot and it's burnt. Again she was very polite, put yet another in the oven and offered to bag one for the rode. 30 more mins pass, and the warm bread pudding never comes. Finally I gave up and took my cold bread pudding and made it at home. If it weren't for the staff's great attitude, this entire trip would've been a bust",neutral,restaurant
165894,"Mediocre, at best. The food wasn't exactly fresh. All three times that I've eaten here have proven to be just...meh...despite all of the pastries and the decor. The confectionaries that I've purchased have, every single time, had a stale refrigerator taste to them. There are also many inconsiderate patrons who don't seem to understand the concept of manners (ie saying excuse me when bumping in to you). The coffee is mediocre, as well...they're trying to be a master of all trades...instead, I'd say they're a jack of them all, a master of none.

I even went back the next day I was around the area because I could not believe that this place was not the best bakery after the long line of people I saw, I thought that maybe I was mistaken maybe I needed to try something else so I tried the fruit tart and it was average like the one at harris teeter nothing out of the ordinary.",neutral,restaurant
165997,"Excellent coffee (and chai) and service, BEAUTIFUL pastries made in-house. Pastries are delicious, light, and not overpoweringly rich.

Possibly on the pricey side for their food items.",neutral,restaurant

166065,"I don't know, y'all... Amelie's sort of weirds me out. I've not ordered anything but pastries and tea, all of which have been decent but not earth-shattering... at least, nothing you can't get at any self respecting bakery styling itself ""French."" One of these days, I'll try a sandwich and/or soup, but I find myself so off-put by the atmo that I generally avoid going, even when I'm craving a ""French"" pastry. It's just so... cavernous. And the decor is a little fussy for my taste. And it feels like a warehouse that someone's grandmother's house has thrown up on. All of this to say that I don't feel particularly relaxed or comfortable when I go to Amelie's, and though I've brought a book or a magazine or some writing, all I really want to do is finish my croissant and split. I think the high ceilings and general lack of space dividers make me feel very exposed. Sort of the same reason I don't like Best Buy.",neutral,restaurant
166071,"Great place, love the actual building and sitting areas, really enjoy most of their food and coffee, just dislike the way they bake my favorite pastry ( the cream puff pastry), they always over cook them and it tastes burned. When I spoke with them they told me that's how they like them cooked. The people are kind and welcoming. But it tends to get a bit loud in there so I like sitting out in the hallway behind the shop, and the WiFi is slow there, so it's great for social get together's.",neutral,restaurant
166073,"If you are looking for a wide variety of sweet treats and a large french press full of coffee then Amelie's is a good choice. If, however, you are looking for a seat actually inside the establishment and internet that actually works I suggest you look elsewhere. See the thing is, Amelie's is a great concept, a 24 hour bakery/coffee shop/food spot, and they execute pretty well, so naturally they are always mobbed. The sheer magnitude of patrons cripples the net. Also, can someone please tell me why there is always some guy at a packed coffee house who thinks everyone needs to hear him play the same progression on his acoustic guitar 40 times, because I don't understand it, but Amelie's sure has one. On the plus side, if you get stuck out in the atrium of the strip center where they have extra seating the friendly Amelieans will still bring you your food as if you were actually inside the bakery. I suggest just popping by, however, to pick up a dozen or three salted caramel brownies. Then you can take them elsewhere and eat them all in privacy while surfing the interwebs...that sounds healthy, right?",neutral,restaurant
166085,"The 3 stars are really for the decor and ambiance of this place. I am a serious lover of most things French and cute... and this place had all of that and more! I was a little disappointed by their pastries (specifically their macarons), but that could also be attributed to the fact that we went at 1am on a Saturday night (have you ever heard of a bakery that's open 24/7?! crazy!). I would really just come back to this place to sit around and soak in all the little je ne sais quoi-s, but I will have to try their pastries again probably during ""normal business hours.""",neutral,restaurant

I came to Charlotte for work and I told by everyone that this was likely the best bakery in Charlotte, with some of the best coffee. I have got to say that Amelies is a good bakery and it's definitely worth a visit. However, I can certainly attest to having better coffee at 7th Street Market and know at least 2 bakeries in Durham, NC that have better pastries and bread by a LONG shot. To the average person who's use to WallMart croissant this is certainly a breath of fresh air - but don't be mislead into thinking this is the best of the best!",neutral,restaurant

I ordered the strawberry cream cake which sounds and looks amazing - truly a piece of art, but it's surely not meant to actually be eaten. It's 90% fondant / stiff pastry cream stuff, with zero taste but LOTS of fat. Little channels were dug out and the smallest amount of cake possible was inserted. On top, another stiff greasy fondant pile /swirl topped it off. The ONLY thing strawberry about this 'cake' was a single strawberry, dipped in some glossy gelatinous substance, placed on top, way out of reach of the cake. And it was ~$6.",neutral,restaurant

Napoleon thought I could share but the top crust is so hard, it is tough to cut n the cream spreads everywhere. Apple tart was ok, eggclair n cream puff were probably a few days old n nothing to brag about. The lemon tart w raspberries was sooo good and there were some other treats w sugar that were perfect. Now that I have consumed so much sugar, I will give you 3 stars because I will be working it off for days and it was not all worth it and is overpriced. Try it if you are in the area but not worth 30 minute drive.",neutral,restaurant

166305,"I was in Charlotte this past weekend, my friend took me here for dessert and I fell in love with this Parisian designed bakery. The decor of this place in a little bit romantic, a little bit eclectic and definitely fun (love the chandelier made out of mini pots/pans). I can't give it more stars because the desserts were hit & miss. I had 3 desserts, yes that's correct 3. The first was the best, a chocolate cup filled with passion fruit chocolate ganache: this was really good, smooth, loved the passion fruit flavor! The second was decent, a coconut macaroon: the outside was nice and crisp but the inside was not as soft as I'm accustomed to. The third dessert was a bit of a disappointment, it was an orange chiffon cake: the cake was quite dry, the frosting was too think for my taste. So I guess 2 out of 3 was not bad, so if next time I'm in Charlotte I'll have to try a few more.",neutral,restaurant
166340,"Friends took me there after dinner. At 9pm on a work night it was packed! We picked out a few pastries and they were... mediocre. We tried 7 or so very different things. Even the super dense chocolaty brownie thing was more ""heavy"" than ""flavorful."" Not mouth watering :( I have to say though, the ambiance will make me go back to try the food! Very cool, fun, old-French-stuff-made-new creative space. I guess the sweets are good if you get a latte with them- they won't make your drink taste nasty and bitter. So it's a great place to hang out and use your laptop, chat with friends, munch and nibble.",neutral,restaurant
166342,"When this place first opened I found it a 5 star experience. The staff was friendly, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was inviting. Now it has gone downhill. The staff seems less than enthusiastic to serve their customers, it's quite disappointing. I still love the pastries and baguettes, but their soups and sandwiches are sub-par and very small for the price. What once was a very fun and inviting place has declined into just being a kitschy tourist stop.",neutral,restaurant
166467,"So, I'm sitting here like usual at Amelie's waiting forever on a sandwich that I ordered 15+min ago and there was no line (ironically) when I got here. Anything I've ever gotten here is golden! Pastries, sandwiches, soups, coffees whatever...it's all been delicious! But, I just can't bring myself to give more than three stars because I have to believe that their process for preparing food orders is just too inefficient and can be faster than it is. The phrase good things come to those who wait is an understatement. If your in a rush or really hungry, bring a book or friends or consider somewhere else. If you have the time, get prepared for good food and pastries.",neutral,restaurant
166570,The good: the pastries and coffee is amazing. The bad: you can never find a seat. I used to come here to study but it's really not somewhere to concentrate. The baristas are sometimes more interested in anything but you're drink (and keep in mind I don't mind waiting for a good drink). Other than that I will say they have the best decor of anyone else.,neutral,restaurant

Arrived around 10:15 on Saturday morning only to learn that...gasp...they had no almond croissants. MAJOR bummer. Decided to try an apple turnover, which was pretty mediocre, and got a cheese danish and chocolate & almond croissant to share the next morning. The cheese danish was decent, not great, and the croissant was excellent. If we had only ordered the chocolate & almond croissant, I would most likely be giving a 4-star rating. Maybe there are other ""wow"" items that we just didn't select...not sure...or maybe we're spoiled having been to Paris & other excellent French bakeries in the States.",neutral,restaurant
166683,"I actually have not eaten there in almost a year, but being a ""sweet tooth"" to the point of addiction,if I had more $, I would frequent it more often! That being said, I actually liked the ORIGINAL Amelies a little better. After they changed hands and branched out-serving sandwiches,etc, it lost some of its ""French bakery"" appeal for me. My daughter really loved the luncheon meals and ate there weekly. I found those to be rather overpriced and mediocre in my humble opinion. But I never had a dessert item that I didn't really enjoy, my favorite being something called Napolean, which is so large and rich, even a sugarholic will get filled eating one! And reading another review about raspberry cream puffs makes me want to venture over and see if they still make them. That reviewer didn't like them, but since I love anything raspberry I want to try one! All in all, I believe I would like Amelies better if they only sold pastry items and coffee, and let the luncheon meals to other restaurants.",neutral,restaurant
166685,"I honestly feel this place is all hype. First: service sort of sucks. There was an employee talking to another employee who was off of work and holding up the line to box her pastries and proceeded to hand them to her over the counter where the line starts. Not sure what company policy is, but she def pretended to pay and didn't. It's also super hard to find! I walked all around and finally a guy told me it's behind the escalators. Almond croissant: very good, buttery, flakey. I warmed it for 20 secs and devoured it.. that's why it's not pictured lol. This is what the 3 stars goes to... Pistachio Macaron: not a fan. It's very very sweet! Barely any pistachio flavor. At 4 something a pop, you'd hope it would be mindblowing. Nice feet, but air bubbles on top. Not nice and smooth. I also got a raspberry and salted caramel. Now I wish I just got more pastries. Will go back, but just for a croissant and to try the other baked goods.",neutral,restaurant
166692,"When you walk into the front of the Venetian, you will need to walk all the way through to the back of the casino to find this, and it's under and escalator. I expected a cute cafe vibe, but it's just a counter that you walk up to and order from. There's no seating so we ate our pastries at the food court. Lots of pastries, a few different coffee selections. I had an iced latte with nonfat milk and vanilla, which was pretty good! My group shared an almond croissant, a chocolate almond croissant, and a pain au chocolat. The pain au chocolat was definitely the best. The chocolate almond croissant was so dry it's likely it was not fresh and perhaps stale. I prefer a very soft, buttery croissant and this was not that. You have to ask them to warm them for you, which we didn't know. Warming it would've improved the taste, but oh well. Disappointed, I had been looking forward to trying this for a while and it just didn't live up to expectations! Service 5/5 Food 3/5 Ambiance 1/5",neutral,restaurant

166811,"Thomas Keller has developed quite a name for himself and his restaurant groups. Most people will know him because of the French Laundry in Napa which led to a ton of other restaurants that he eventually opened in NYC. They're famous for a reason as his food is really second to none. Some of my fondest memories of my trip to the French Laundry was definitely the baked goods. Served hot in a basket, we were offered various types of bread multiple times throughout the night. We even got to take home some shortbread cookies at the end of the night! Thinking about all that great food had me nostalgic for some of Keller's cooking. Bouchon Bakery is part of his restaurant group and somehow we bumped into it. We are always looking for that perfect U.S. baguette and a good almond croissant. The fragrance of fresh baked goods drew us over so we had to check them out! Instead of a baguette today, we got an epi (small one) and an almond croissant. The epi was not bad but tough to eat. Had to really work my jaw muscles. Perhaps heating it up would have made a difference. The almond croissant looked perfect on the outside (in fact for those who did enjoy it, you can find a recipe online!) but it didn't hit the spot for me. I felt that the almond paste was not sweet or smooth enough. For me, the perfect almond croissant needs to be buttery to the point you almost lose all the flakiness of the croissant. Then the almond paste should be silky/buttery smooth with tons of sugar but not masking the incredibly rich notes of almond. This paste should fill the pastry so that every bite you got a mouthful. Unfortunately, we did not find what we were looking for here this time. Will always be willing to give a Keller restaurant another try. The baked goods today just didn't quite do it for me.",neutral,restaurant
166830,"Upon arrival at Venetian, you'll find multiple small Bouchon bakeries spotting the area. After so many alcohol and cold drinks, my sweet tooth hasn't been quite satisfied. The pastries were quite eye catching and line wasn't too bad as I spent time contemplating what to get. Some of the cakes looked dried out, and was dubious how fresh they were. I settled on ""Oh Oh"" which is a chocolate cake with cream roll, a fancier version of Swiss Rolls. Just not as sweet, but sugar flavor was still bit over powering. Chocolate did not have the depth of bitterness to combat this, and it ended up being unimpressive. Looks pretty, but that's the extent.",neutral,restaurant

166943,"An ok stop for breakfast if you are in a hurry. They sell out of breakfast sandwiches and bagels really quickly, so if you come past 7:00 you'll like be stuck with something sweet. The pastries are ok. They tasted like stuff I could find at pretty much any bakery. The staff didn't offer to hear them up. The people behind the counter seemed really disorganized and even left one item off my order when they handed it to me. When I asked them about it, the girl at the register said ""oh, did you still want that?"". Well, I ordered it and paid for it, so yea, I do. Not totally impressed.",neutral,restaurant
166984,"Heads up: the Venetian has Bouchon BAKERY (a small pastry and coffee counter) as well as Bouchon BISTRO (separate listing for dine-in brunch, lunch, and dinner). Apparently there was some mix up about that because reviews for both businesses frequently show up on one another's pages, and now Yelp HQ has handled this by closing the old bakery page and opening a new one. ¯\_(ãƒ„)_/¯ I'm somewhat surprised this business still has the Bouchon name on it- the quality is nowhere near what you receive at the bistro, despite a few shared items, nor is the quality. The TKO (Keller's version of the Oreo) is a fantastic sugarbomb, and the macarons are larger than most other places have them, but stick to the seasonal flavors and go earlier in the day. Cookie sandwiches here MUST be split between at least two people, they're large and delicious but probably pack over a day's worth of calories. As for their delicious epi bread? It's better when accompanied by a delicious dinner at the full restaurant. The chocolate bouchons are also better had there. The service here is notoriously awful. I don't know if they're going for a detached snobby French aesthetic, but every cashier I've ever had the displeasure of working with here has had an attitude and a scowl. It's a simple job and it's in the service industry, how hard is it to make your face NOT look like you are on Death Row? The fact that the receipts here automatically print out a tip line is hysterical, I've received better service from an ATM.",neutral,restaurant

Macaroons were inconsistent, some dry and they didn't seem to have the same texture as the ones I had before. However, I did finally get the TKO cookie and that was good. I can only imagine how much better the one in Yountville must've tasted. Maybe the pastries/cookies are flown in from Yountville.

However, the texture was not the same. This place was not appetizing at all. Yountville, CA location definitely has everything to perfection & the selection is limitless.",neutral,restaurant
167459,"We decided to make a quick stop here for breakfast and for coffee before we drove out to California. We walked down the strip to The Venetian, and started to look for the bakery. Since we couldn't find any signs pointing the way, we stopped and asked someone. We were told that it was upstairs on the 10th floor. We continued on through the casino and then asked someone else, who pointed us around the corner, where we found the bakery. We later discovered that it wasn't the full bakery, but a little quick-buy section. We ordered a Madeline, some macarons, a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant as well as coffee. The macarons were outstanding, the coffee and the vanilla ones were the best. They were beautifully flavored and lovely and chewy, but crisp. The rum ones, and a few other flavors, weren't as good, but were still tasty. The croissants and the madeline were tasty, but quite stale, which was a huge disappointment. To top it off, our big was huge. It was close to $50, which is ridiculous for a few baked goods and two coffees, especially since half the stuff we bought was stale, and we bought it in the morning.",neutral,restaurant
167465,"Danggggggg, a chocolate croissant and a PB&J macaroon for $8?!?!?!?!! you must be sh!tting me! I all of a sudden felt ripped off but am too embarrassed to say ""oh, then I don't want the chocolate croissant"" so fine. I paid it. And almost instantly regretted getting the chocolate croissant. It tasted like it's been sitting there for the entire day and was hard to bite into. Definitely not what I had dreamed of...a soft, flaky, buttery croissant :( Thank God the Pb&J macaroon was delicious! It was chewy on the outside, peanut butter on the inside filled with strawberry jam in the center! But is this worth $3? NO WAY, JOSE! I complain when I have to pay $1.50 for a small macaroon! Now, you're just pressing my buttons. This place is a one time only deal.",neutral,restaurant
167481,"$20 for coffee and pastries is criminal. The pastries were worth it, but $5 coffee hurts. Yes, I know, it's Vegas-I should just open my wallet and spill the contents into the street, because I know I'll be coming home broke anyway. Cheers~",neutral,restaurant
167500,"Okay I did not get lost between Venetian and Palazzo for twenty minutes to find such a random small stand under the escalator! Yes, the macarons are delicious, but dayum it is expensive! Back home, i can get it for $1.65 for the same size and im already flipping tables! After purchasing one for $3.50 ..I'm ready to go to the gym, build some muscles, and come back and flip the entire stand. But I have to admit, it was pretty good. The butter cream was nice and moist and the outer layer was a mixture of crunchy but yet soft. I got the pistachio macarons and boy oh boy ..melted inside my mouth and I was literally in heaven! Can't visit this place all the time.. Or else I'll become bankrupt.... And overweight",neutral,restaurant
167518,"We got a Pain au Raisin and Banana Nut Muffin with 2 coffees. They were good, but given the expensive price tags, it's only 3stars worthy. Honestly I've had better pastries. BTW, you can't charge it to the room because they are not associated with the hotel! Lame!",neutral,restaurant
167565,"While this little Bouchon outpost has decent espressos and very nice service, I have been disappointed in the famous Keller macarons each of the three or four times I've had them. Macarons are my favorite treat and these have simply been stale every time. They are hard, not crisp and light. I can't eat the other bread-y things because I'm gluten intolerant, so I can't speak for those items. I would come back for the espresso though, certainly.",neutral,restaurant
167574,"The macaroons are always good here. In fact, I really wouldn't be surprised if everything else here was just as good too. However, when I came here last week to grab some macaroons for my gf's family, the service sucked a bit. Now this is rating is lowered for the service, and I would've normally given this place four stars if it wasn't for the girl that helped us. Honestly, if you're going to help people, especially excited and eager people that are already sold on the product you offer, don't roll your eyes blatantly in front of us because we ordered more than three things. Especially when the macaroon sets are out and you visibly pouted because you had to put one together in a regular box on the spot. I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she was having a bad day, but I've worked in retail and having an attitude problem isn't the way to go. I mean, what the hell, we were saying sorry for the ""trouble"" and we really didn't have to do that.",neutral,restaurant
167582,"I saw they had palm sized french macarons and I knew I had to buy a few before leaving Vegas. I've never seen french macarons so large and the price wasn't bad at all for $3.50 a macaron (compared to the normally tiny expensive bites). They didn't have as much cream filling and the outer shell was a bit harder then what I'm used to, but they were still light and chewy. I enjoyed them for their size and flavor, but I didn't enjoy them as much as others I've had.",neutral,restaurant
167590,"After hearing so much about macarons, I figured since I was staying at the Venetian I must try Bouchon Bakery's macarons. Given, I've never had macarons before, I couldn't compare it to anything else. I thought they were pretty tasty, the pistachio was my favorite. I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off. I think I'm going to have get use to them before I gave a thoughtful review. This bakery is hidden so you might just miss it.",neutral,restaurant
167709,"The macaroons are delicious, but I think that's all I will come here for in the future. Breakfast is overpriced and believe me, you're not getting anything special compared to the food court that is 10 feet away. It's worth a try but don't expect anything amazing.",neutral,restaurant
167716,"Food in Vegas is just not that good! Even though this bakery is top-notch by Vegas standards, it was just A-OK in the 3 items I tried here!",neutral,restaurant
167722,"Because I stayed at the Venetian, it was inevitable that I passed this place every time I left/went to the room. After seeing the good reviews on yelp I decided to give it a try. $17.50 or so for a box of about 6? A bit pricey, but what isn't in Vegas? Out of all the flavors, I liked only the espresso one. It had a good amount of coffee taste to it, but not overwhelming. The filling used for these macarons are not overly sweet which tends to be the case with most places. But basically, all the other flavors with the exception of chocolate and espresso basically tasted to same to me. And maybe it was a bad batch, but out of the 6, I think half of them were hollow in the middle. Which is not how a properly made macaron should be. The girl that helped us was a bit slow? But maybe it's been a long day. Overall, they're alright. Not the best I've ever had. But if you must try something, I would definitely go for the espresso.",neutral,restaurant
167783,"This place is hard to find and there is no seating. Would go again though. Tried the Espresso Macaroon and the Red Velvet cupcake .. 'bout as big a 5 yr. old's head. Pass on the cupcake though..yeah it was big and beautiful but it just wasn't fresh. Frosting was great though and the macaroon was perfect. I will try again my next time out to Vegas. But, I will go early morning and during the week as suggested. So stay tuned!",neutral,restaurant
167788,"It was Sunday night at 8:00 and it took me awhile to find the place. I was looking at the macaroons and this guy started to enclose the ropes on us. I decided to buy the macaroons, one of each, and was told that I get one for free if I get five. OK, good. Then the same guy that was surrounding the ropes on us started asking us loudly ""Is that all? Is that all?"" right after we ordered from this lady. I thought they open til 9pm, I guess they wanted to close up. OK, no problem. So, I whipped out my credit card in a hurry. Guess what? The same guy that hates us wanted to see ID for $17.50. Now, I am annoyed. After all this, Mr. Hater asked me in a condescending tone while holding the receipt ""You want the receipt?"" Anyway, the macaroons were great, delicious actually. But I will not go back again for the over priced macaroons and get run off again.",neutral,restaurant
167793,"Seriously? Really? You gotta be joking! Those were some of my replies when I asked people about the sandwiches and pastries served here when they told how good, and what an orgasmic experience it was to eat stuff here. Well, shit, call me a lemming, but I had to try it out for myself. I came here to eat a light lunch, and after looking at the size of the sandwiches, it was an ultra light lunch. For that size, being $11, it better be the best fucking sandwich I've ever had in my life. Sadly, totally not the case. I ordered the turkey and cheese (brie) on a focaccia bread (toasted) and it was really OK. I mean for such a famous place, and supposedly great bread, I wasn't WOWed by it. The sandwich overall was not bad, I mean the brie really meshed well with the turkey and the turkey was flavorful. I guess I was expecting a lot from this place, and I left slightly disappointed. Now, I was told the Macaroons are amazing here, but I think next time, I'll take a pass and eat something else. Honestly, I'm just not a fan and I would have been just as happy with a sandwich from Johnny Rocket down in the food court.",neutral,restaurant
167797,"One of the first things I wanted to try in Las Vegas were the macarons from Bouchon. All of my friends have been ranting and raving about macarons, and I wanted to see what the hype was all about! I guess I had high expectations.. I expected a nice large bakery, but it was small.. and had a few selections. The price of one macaron is $3.50.. it cost a lot more than what i thought it was worth! I bought 6, only because I didnt know when i would try them again, and I dont know where I can find these in San Diego. Im really glad i bought that many because they ended up tasting really good! Theyre super sweet, and delicious. My favorite has to be the vanilla macaron. Highly recommend! Customer service was great, and the location of this bakery was far from the nasty smoking smell in the casino!",neutral,restaurant
167829,"I tried out the macaroons and the almond croissant. The almond croissant was nice and flaky and had the right flavor, but I thought it was a bit dryer and crunchier than I was expecting, especially for the first few bites. The macaroons were the right flavor, but when you bit into them they didn't have the pillowy center I was expecting. In my opinion it was a bit too spendy for the quality ($3.50 for a small 2"" diameter macaroon??)",neutral,restaurant
167851,"Mmmmm macarons!!!! Seriously addictive! We had a hard time finding the bakery stand. It's hidden behind some stairwell in the Venetian hotel. Perfectly crispy and airy on the outside and moist and chewy on the center. We bought a six pack: vanilla, 2 pistachio, strawberry, pumpkin, chocolate. My favorite was the pistachio. They are a decent size.",neutral,restaurant

168000,"We tried the macarons, turkey cheese on a croissant, and a banana walnut muffin. I think we were there a little too early, about 7 a.m. that they didn't have a lot of items. I'll just review the macarons, since the other stuff was good, but nothing special. They are 3.50 a piece, but are a lot bigger than the average macaron. The cookie part is utter perfection, a nice outer shell with chewiness when you bite into it. The filling however, was too soft and buttery for me, especially the pistachio. I prefer my fillings to be a lot more thick and rich. My favorite was the caramel, didn't care for the chocolate at all. I'm glad to have tried it, but don't know if I would go back again - maybe if I stopped by and saw that they had a bigger selection, like more savory items.",neutral,restaurant
168062,"Make sure you go to Bouchon Bakery during the week. The food seems to be made fresh daily during the week, but the weekend seems to be leftovers from Friday's batch. We went on a Friday AM and a Saturday AM and the quality was vastly different. The beignet on Thursday was the best I had ever had and the cheese danish was fantastic. On Friday, the danish and the brioche were both very subpar.",neutral,restaurant
168069,"Mmm.. I was kind of expecting a bit more for a place so popular for their macarons.. Yes the macarons are super big but also too chewy and too sweet for my taste. They also carry pretty limited flavors, only about 6 different ones. i had better so it's hard to love Bouchon Bakery.. but I suppose the macarons are still enjoyable, just don't have too high expectations.",neutral,restaurant
168107,"It was good but quite frankly, too expensive. I think every ice cream and gelato shop is overpriced anymore. I'm tired of paying the price of a gallon of ice cream for a scoop or two.

168481,THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE they were so friendly and knowledgeable. 3 stars for the ice cream: Cereal as toppings and unique flavors like honey lavender and bourbon caramel toffee crunch. The ladies next to me tried the Cookie Monster and it made their mouth blue. I sampled the honey lavender. Not a strong lavender or honey flavor. I ended up going with the frosted sugar cookie in the donut with Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I appreciated the unique flavors but nothing wowed me. The ice cream donut sandwich I got was so sweet I couldn't finish it. I might go back to give it another try. I might have gotten the wrong flavor.,neutral,restaurant
169315,"Touristing my way through Scottsdale, I'd bookmarked a few of those ""Food Network"" locations prior to my vacation. And y'know what? Shame on me, because that technique has led me wrong more times than not. Following a tasty dinner, my wife and I stopped at Sweet Republic for a small sweet treat. Neither of us had enough room for one of the massive sundaes, so it was a single scoop for both of us, and I topped mine with a roasted marshmallow because that seemed like an awesome idea. Sadly, the marshmallow tasted like a cross between melted plastic and butane. Could've been the torch that was used to fast-roast it, but I commented to my wife how it tasted seriously foul. My ice cream was pretty good. I went with the almond toffee something or other. Not the best I've ever had, but not bad in my opinion. My wife went with salted caramel and complained that it was completely tasteless. I sampled it, and had to agree. No flavor at all. I thought the prices were pretty fair. I know other yelpers complain that they're a bit steep, but I think for a small family location like this (especially with all the attention they get) they were pretty reasonable. Service was super friendly and fast too. All in all, I don't know that I'd make it a regular place if I lived in the area, but it wasn't too bad. Maybe they need to work on a few of the flavors, tho.",neutral,restaurant
169409,"This place is good - not my favorite - but good. The flavors are definitely artisan. But honestly, some of them tasted ""off"" to me. I actually had a difficult time finding two flavors I liked... which is unheard of! But that being said, the flavors I got (vanilla with brownie chunks & peanut butter chip) were A-OK. My partner got vanilla and he said it's some of the best ice cream he's ever had. So it's preference (as always). If you like artisan flavors, this may be your place. A friend of mine got the mint chocolate chip and loved it. I tasted it and thought it was way too intense. If you like real mint, go for it. Honestly though, even putting my desire for more traditional flavors aside - I still only give this place a 3. The texture wasn't as creamy as I like and again, the flavors were a bit off. It seems like this place is more known for its specialty creations - like their s'mores sundae, milkshakes, and ice cream sandwiches with homemade cookies. I'd go back and try something different. Prices are comparable with most ice cream shops these days. Overall: All-natural and local ingredients, clean environment, friendly staff, ample parking. A-OK.",neutral,restaurant

I was met with innovative and different flavors, like honey lavender and almond butter crunch, but mediocre ice cream. As a whole this place has awesome creations like the banofee cup and ice cream cookies, but I went with the good ole double scoop of milk and cookies and brownie swirl. Both totally edible, but not the best ice cream I've ever had. They have some board games available too, which would make for a super cute date night. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here for their ice cream, but would totally try one of their creations if I found myself in the area with a sweet tooth.",neutral,restaurant
169531,"So everyone loves this place... it's ranked top 10 in the top culinary magazines. If you have a super sweet tooth you'll love it too. I... liked it. The problem is, the more I thought of it after I left, the less I liked it. It was good ice cream but verrrry rich, creamy and sweet. It was a lil too much for me even though I got the less sweet of all my samples. Maybe I just like things a bit more simple. The girl was very friendly though and patiently gave us samples of ice cream and even their bacon brittle. My friends were very happy! I'd go back but would really rather keep it more simple with ice cream... or better, a healthier fro-yo! If I go again, I'd definitely stick with their sorbets.

Also felt a bit adventerous and had the honey-blue cheese that was good and different though it was no wow experience. If i would go there again sometime in the future i think i would go all in and have one of the sundaes with wipped cream and sauce. Its a bit pricey for icecream but not too bad.",neutral,restaurant

The employees were incredibly patient and genuinely kind while we spent a few minutes going over their choices - even offering samples and recommendations. My mini cupcake was nice and moist and I loved the gooey center. My gripe: the price! $2.50 for a mini cupcake is insane. My husband got a milkshake which was delicious but the paper straw was TERRIBLE. It got soggy and was not sturdy enough for the milkshake ingredients to pass through the straw. We had to throw half of the milkshake away because we couldn't drink it. I love the idea of being environmentally conscious but the straw made it impossible for us to enjoy your product.,neutral,restaurant

I've had both give cream and cupcakes taste fine. Being right next to in-n-out helps bring in ton of traffic. Where they can improve is the speed of the service.

Usually when you are drunk every thing tastes better. Maybe it is because I always come in at night. I have also gotten the wrong cupcake out of the vending machine twice. First time I thought it was user error but second time I know I did not get what I selected. That being said I am sure I will be back next time I am drunk and in the area.",neutral,restaurant
170168,"Sprinkles Las Vegas is a cute cupcake and ice cream shop. Choose from an assortment of freshly made cupcakes in flavors such as coconut, vanilla, chocolate-marshmallow, strawberry, peanut butter chip, carrot, and lemon-blueberry. I tried the salted caramel and their best seller, the red velvet. The salted caramel is a denser cupcake, the texture is more like a banana bread. I didn't enjoy this cupcake as much because I prefer an airier cupcake. The red velvet hit the spot. Light and airy, moist, with chocolaty flavor and the right ration of cake to sweet cream cheese frosting. At $3.75 a piece, visually the cupcakes are pretty plain. Frosting is smoothed on with an off-set spatula rather than piped on in fancy designs--but we don't care as long as it tastes good, right? Just don't eat the circle decoration on top, it's hard and tasteless. Sprinkles is a great place to stop by when you're looking for a sweet treat.",neutral,restaurant

I got 3 cupcakes plus the free one: Chocolate marshmallow, S'more, Banana Peanut butter and Caramel vanilla at $3.75 each. Nothing really stood out, even the chocolate marshmallow which was once my favorite was just ok, I still like the bitterness of the ganache but that was it. The Caramel vanilla which was a suggestion by one of the girls tasted stale. Their specials for the month: S'more, dark chocolate cake with graham on the bottom and toasted marshmallow frosting was good but then again I like anything s'mores. The Banana peanut butter was banana cake with creamy peanut butter frosting wasn't memorable either.

If I had only tried one inside, then it would be 5 star, if I had only tried one from the ATM, it would be 1 star...so 3 is the average. Inside, the sprinkles cupcake was moist and perfectly rich, a great buttercream and sprinkle topping, and the staff was friendly. It was not even $4.00 for my cupcake. A bit later we were walking back to my car and I wanted to get one to go. The ATM only had four choices available, not the total number that the interior had.

We decided that all of a sudden nothing sounded better than a cupcake so we went inside. There was a long line but lucky for us it was for their ice cream and not their cupcakes. We made out decisions, purchased, and sat outside to enjoy our cupcakes. Since it was Halloween/Fall they had a delicious looking caramel apple cupcake so that is what i had. It was good but nothing close to the best cupcake I have ever had. My friends felt the same about their banana and vanilla cupcakes. One of the coolest things I have ever seen was their cupcake ATM. Yes, it really is an ATM that dispenses cupcakes instead of cash. I rather have cash but cupcakes are a close second. If the line is long you might as well use the ATM outside since it is fun and gives you the same thing as inside.",neutral,restaurant

170284,"Really good cupcakes. Really expensive cupcakes. Deducted one star for cost/benefit. I enjoyed the cupcakes that I tried and even brought home an half dozen. Traditional and unique flavor combinations and a very dense cake batter mix make for a rich and satisfying cupcake. The fact they are almost $4 a piece (and they are about the size of a standard cupcake; I realize that's a subjective statement, but think of a cupcake wrapper you buy at the grocery store, same size here) make for a double take. My favorite was the chocolate and peanut butter combo. That and the chilled $3 bottle of 8.75 oz of Pellegrino was a nice respite from the Vegas heat. The store also has an ice cream section that I did not try. Based on the cost/benefit analysis in my head, I probably won't.",neutral,restaurant

First, my wonderful boyfriend surprised me at work one day with mini cupcakes and fresh cookies. Like almost still warm, so fresh. The cookies were amazingly good. For sure one of the best I have had. But wait, I thought Sprinkles was a cupcake place? My coworker and I split the minis and they were decent. But did not compare to the cookies. My second experience was after a super cool Yelp event. A few of us decided to try this place for a sweet spot. I got a cupcake, some ice cream, and a few cookies togo. The ice cream, nasty. DID NOT LIKE AT ALL. The regular size cupcake. Eh. It was ok, but not worth the price or the fame. I actually enjoyed the minis more. The cookies the second time around, also eh. They were not as fresh and didn't live up to the previous enjoyment I once had. Is Sprinkles a way cool addition to the Linq area and the wheel? YES. Will it bring in a shit ton of money? HELL YES. Will I return? Proabaly not when there are quite a few mom and pop bakeries with better prices off the strip. This place is great for some, just not for locals.

I can't say that these cupcakes were so out of this world as to justify spending about $6 on one. Now, the cupcake itself- pretty good! I got the Triple Cinnamon, and it was moist and dense. The frosting was a little overly sweet, but like I said, it takes a lot for me to complain about a cupcake. And luckily, we came at the exact right time- the line wasn't long, but it was slow (about a 10 minute wait with only 2-3 people ahead of us). I don't know how exactly they got in the weeds, but by the time we left, the line was out of the door. Whew! I'm glad that I didn't have to wait in that madness.

Yes, everything was good but it didn't give me the WOW FACTOR that I was looking for in places like this. Overall, moist & yummy cupcakes plus yummy ice cream? Delicious combination, but way too overpriced in my opinion.",neutral,restaurant
170487,Very sweet. Too sweet. Expensive. However cashier was nice and even gave sample. Loves the tables outside to sit by fountain. Make sure to brush teeth after sugary treat!,neutral,restaurant
170494,"I really like Sprinkles, but their frosting can get a little overwhelming... I got the strawberry ice cream with mini red velvet cupcake. It's a really cute store but their employees at this Sprinkles was a little lacking... They were playing with their phones and gossiping to each other while there were customers in line. Sure it's fun but it's a little unprofessional to say the least. They were friendly but still. I thought the strawberry ice cream was a little too sour? I wasn't sure if it was because I paired it with sweet red velvet, but the cream cheese frosting did get overwhelming that I had to just discard it. Overall I enjoyed the experience with my new friends. I definitely won't go back to this Sprinkles on purpose though.",neutral,restaurant
170638,The famous sprinkles...in regards to decor the cupcakes are definitely minimalist. It makes you rethink the cupcakes of your youth. My husband got the cinnamon sugar (without icing) and I got the double cinnamon sugar with icing. I really loved the icing but the actual cake part fell flat (it's usually the opposite with me). My husband who isn't really into sweets loved the cupcake. This makes me wonder is it really a cupcake if you market to those who aren't that into sweets? I might try sprinkles again but will probably do the cupcake ATM for novelty or maybe incorporate the ice cream function of the store into my order.,neutral,restaurant
170643,"Let's be honest-- I love sprinkles. I used to get their cupcakes every time we would go to SoCal, and was so happy that they decided to open up a location here in Vegas. We've been to their location at the linq quite a couple of times, but yesterday's visit was just disappointing. I dragged a couple of friends with me to satisfy my cupcake craving, but what I got instead were two very dry and crumbly cupcakes. I got the seasonal chocolate chip cookie cupcake and my favorite, the dark chocolate cupcake. As soon as I bit into the chocolate chip cookie one, the whole cake practically crumbled in my hand. I had to use a fork just so I wouldn't make a mess. Whatever, I thought it was just that cupcake, but when I came home to eat the dark chocolate cupcake the same thing happened. The cake fell apart, and broke off into tiny little pieces. I mean, the flavors were still there, frosting was still great, but it was just not enjoyable to eat. It just didn't feel nor did it taste fresh. I know I'll be back anyway since, as I've mentioned, I love sprinkles, but hopefully next time will be a better experience.",neutral,restaurant
170645,"I have heard so many things about this place... and maybe that made my expectations extremely high... and it didn't live up to that expectation. Tried 4 flavors - Red Velvet, Orange, Lemon Coconut, and Cuban Coffee. Now I have to let you know, I LOOOOVVVEE me some sweets. I love all things sugary and I enjoy baking as well as discovering all wonderful bakeries. These cupcakes had a simple presentation. The cake was moist, but it was not outstanding. 4 cupcakes for $15. Of the 4, my favorite was the Cuban Coffee. I really really wanted to love the red velvet, because I love red velvet, but I didn't. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The frosting was very sugary.. like hard-shell. Maybe I will try the ice cream next time. The location is nice though. Picked up the cupcakes here. Grabbed coffee across the street at Ghiradelli, and sat outside by the fountain on a beautiful afternoon.",neutral,restaurant
170666,"Wasn't anything too special, though it may be because we got in right before closing. Ended up getting ice cream with a red velvet waffle cone. The cone was pretty good, though because it was late in the day it wasn't as fresh and it could have been. The ice cream was also decent but because of the flavour we got (salted caramel) I couldn't eat much of it so I let me girlfriend eat most of it. Didn't get a chance to try any cupcakes because I was too full from eating earlier but I'd recommend you try and get there earlier in the day.",neutral,restaurant
170697,"I really only wanted to come here for the cute little ATM Sprinkles experience. I'm one to pay for experience more than anything especially while on vacation. It's awesome that you can buy a cupcake from a vending machine anytime of the day. It was a late night adventure after the higher roller experience that I was craving for a cupcake. It's an easy touch screen process where you can pick and choose what flavor you want and it'll come right out after payment. I got the red velvet which I thought wasn't as great as other red velvet cupcakes I've tried. It was a bit dry. I wish it tasted just as good as it appeals to be. Could it have been that it's because it's from the ATM and not fresh from inside the store?! hmm.. but the experience itself was cool. I was just expecting a little bit more for a $4.25 cupcake price. Although, I'll definitely try the other items in the store when I'm in town again.",neutral,restaurant
170737,"Ok, I may be the only person who does not get the whole cupcake craze. I thought the cupcakes were ok, nothing special. We had to wait in a line outside, which was weird but I understood why they were doing it. The thing is there was no communication with the line being for the ice cream part of the store. If you just wanted cupcakes, you could just go into the other side of the store. They staff may want to let people know that. There was noone in line for the cupcakes. It was a little overwhelming when 2 to 3 gals asking what you wanted or if ive been helped. I think the customer service was great but still a bit much. I got 4 mini cupcakes, my friends got something with ice cream. Again, nothing really special. I dont think I would come back, just because I dont like cupcakes.",neutral,restaurant
170750,"I'm a local and have been here a few times ever since it opened. I have never been disappointed by their ice cream. I always dig creative flavors and sundaes. However, their cupcakes have let me down on occasion; they're sometimes not very moist. It's moments like that when I just want to stick with Nothing Bundt Cakes (or local bakery). That being said, I will give their cupcakes another chance. The service is always good though. Last week, when I went in to try the Gingerbread cupcake, the girl helping me was soo friendly. I wish I remembered her name (short hair with glasses and a sweet tone of voice).",neutral,restaurant
170821,"So the girls and I on a Friday decided to get some sweets for a friends birthday after dinner, and Sprinkles so happened to be something we have all wanted to try! We had went up to order and the girl who took our order was very kind and helpful. As soon as we went to the register one of my friends had over heard one of the girls say how annoying and loud we where being and wish we would leave. I was in complete shock!!! It was so rude and disrespectful, I had asked the register girl what her name was and she said something along the lines of merella, but regardless it left a bitter taste. (No pun intended) We where close to being done eating when one of the workers walked up to us to apologize about what happened because she had been told what she said, she was very sincere and kind about the whole situation and I applaud her for that. I didn't catch her name.",neutral,restaurant
170855,"Just had the black and white and the chocolate marshmallow. The icing on the black and white was descent, but the cake was dry and not a good flavor. The icing on the chocolate marshmallow wasn't good and again the cake was dry and didn't taste good. I would have given 2 stars, but the service was quick and very friendly, so I'm giving them an extra star. It's too bad the cupcakes look better then they taste.",neutral,restaurant

170935,cupcake vending on west side - funny and gets a lot of traffic.,neutral,restaurant
170936,I tried the chocolate coconut cupcake. It was moist and just ok. It cost $3.75 plus additional .30 to eat inside. Even though it had a lot of coconut shreds at the top I could barely taste the coconut. The frosting was too sweet & it over powered the coconut shreds.,neutral,restaurant
170941,"Very good coffee. Reasonable prices for the strip. We tried icecream & cupcakes, both were far too sweet. The red velvet icecream had icing in it which over the top in a bad way. A plus was the moistness of the cupcake.",neutral,restaurant
170946,"I first heard about Sprinkles when New York City got their cupcake ATM. I was pretty excited when I found out there was one in Las Vegas so my boyfriend and I decided to stop by and grab a couple cupcakes for the drive home after riding the High Roller. I was rather disappointed in the quality of the cupcakes. I got four of them from the ATM: two red velvet, one vanilla milk chocolate, and a mocha. I am a huge fan of cupcakes and I had my hopes up for some amazing cupcakes based on all of the hype and the line that was out the door. The frosting was overly sweet and overpowered the taste of the cupcake itself. Of course I didn't eat all four that night, but the next day the cupcake had already become very dry and the frosting was almost hard. Compared to other cupcake places in Vegas, Sprinkles was a little above average, but I have had better. I wouldn't mind going to Sprinkles if I am on the Strip, but I don't think it is worth the trip down there especially with all the traffic.",neutral,restaurant
170960,"I was craving ice cream and after striking out at churroholic (the line was soooo long) we ended up here. The ice cream was....ok. for the price though, we could have gotten local artisan ice cream elsewhere in the valley. It just wouldn't make sense to go here unless this was close to your home. It's ice cream, so it isn't bad. It just wouldn't be my first choice in town.",neutral,restaurant
170984,"This place is a place I would try once. I think I was expecting much more because the pictures on yelp look so good. I ordered the big daddy ice cream sandwich. It comes with two huge macaron cookies and your choice of ice cream flavors. Then it is topped with a marshmallow toasted to your preference. I really like the concept of this place. The ice cream is really presented in a beautiful manner. However, the ice cream itself was not creamy enough for me. The ice cream had a ice like consistency. Also the macaron became so hard because the ice cream froze the cookie. The macaron gets lost in this modern sundae. The macaron because frozen and soggy. Overall, I would suggest trying it once. You would get a cute Instagram picture. But, personally I don't see myself getting my ice cream fix from here again.",neutral,restaurant
171025,"Eh, fine in an ice cream emergency. Vanilla and cherry are sticky sweet, toasted marshmallow is a bonus on top. No option to mix flavors in a small size cup. $13 for two small scoops is too much for me.",neutral,restaurant
171043,"We got the Fatty Daddy--it was VERY tasty, but it was like our 3rd choice. I made the mistake of falling in love with some of the flavors and macaron combinations I saw on Yelp and Instagram, and almost every kind I wanted was out of stock. Such a letdown! We ended up picking something my husband and I could agree on since we made the trip out there, but I wasn't in love with it. The woman working there was kind enough to offer samples and apologized for not having the kinds we wanted in stock (totally understandable), but it's hard to justify anything above 3 stars due to the limited choices we had relatively early in the afternoon on a week day.",neutral,restaurant
171054,"I had the single scoop of Salted Caramel and it was interesting. It tasted like a cinnamon roll and not really at all like Caramel.....my husband had the strawberry guava, it was good kinda like a smoothie but not very creamy. This is not a place I would want to come back to. The aesthetic of the place is very interesting.",neutral,restaurant
171104,"This place was definitely different. The location was a little far from most of Main Street. The atmosphere was average but there was a fair amount of seating for an ice cream shop. There was unique artwork, 'wall flair', that a person could purchase. The ice cream flavors were largely varied but the quality was average. The macaron cookie was great and the homemade marshmallow on top was a unique contribution to the 'Fatty Daddy' combo.",neutral,restaurant
171259,Way over priced and the ice cream is nothing special. The macron didn't taste all that fresh either. I will not return. Service was good and clean atmosphere. Too many other options for a better value.,neutral,restaurant
171263,"Gelato, macaroon, and a toasted marshmallow, very basic- kinda overpriced. The gelato is tasty, variety of flavors to pick from! The marshmallows and macaroons aren't anything unique. Small seating, cute/clean restroom, limited parking. It's yes for some people to find this place as it's tucked back in a dark ally.",neutral,restaurant
171279,"This place is ok. Customer service is not the best and the ice cream quality is neutral to me. The dinning was interesting , the wood chairs are way too tall to sit and talk with the person next to you!",neutral,restaurant
171300,Super nice lady at the counter. Lots of great and different flavors but pretty forgettable taste. I had the hazelnut with marshmallow topping and an almond macaroon. It was just ok....nothing special. The boy got coconut ice cream and a coconut macaroon and loved it. We also took a red velvet macaroon home and enjoyed it later. It was all pretty decent.,neutral,restaurant
171538,"I have only been there once, and I was disappointed. They didn't have any macaroons, and the ice cream looked sparse.",neutral,restaurant
171588,"Yum yum yummy!! I love desserts! They have pastries where you can grab your own. They are individually wrapped. I get other pastries to try but the one I love the most and always get is the Ube Marble. It's mashed sweet purple yam in sweet bread. Better when toasted. They do have cakes which I'm sure is sweet and good. I haven't really tried those. They have different variety of teas and coffee and boba. When we first walked in, we were not greeted nor asked if we needed help. But they did answer questions when asked and were nice. You can eat your dessert inside in a different room. That room was a bit messy with tables that weren't clean and few garbage laying around. We still enjoyed eating some of our treats there!",neutral,restaurant
171652,"I'm pretty stoked that Vegas finally has an 85c bakery here. I no longer have to drive all the way to SoCal for ""fresh bread"". This bakery is a lot smaller than the ones I've been to. The quality of the bread and iced sea salt coffee is equivalent to the other bakeries. Please keep that up! I'm rating this a 3-star because of their inefficiency on inventory and line control, plus their ""no ice"" policy on their drinks. Inventory: The shelves would have one or two bread left or it'd be empty. But you'd see a fully loaded bakery rack chilling in the corner. I'd suggest assigning an additional person to deliver those bread. Line control: This shop has been opened for 2-3 months now, there's still a long line, most of the time it's even out the door. I get it. Everyone in vegas wants their bread. I once came on a Tuesday night around 8pm, thinking I'd bypass the long line. Well, I kind of did. I bypassed the line to grab bread. But the line to pay was long, and it took forever. They only had 2 cashiers when there were 20+ people in line. They definitely need more help; assign an additional cashier or a person to bag up the bread to expedite the process upon check out.",neutral,restaurant
171740,"I have tried a variety of breads here as well as in California and wasn't really a huge fan and would say it's a hit or miss depending on what you get. The price point is amazing, and the bread is fresh. I feel the variety is limited compared to the Cali locations and they tend to have a repeat of the same breads on the other side of the bakery. The cakes or a no-go for me. The cream cheese filled breads I like, but I'm also a huge cream cheese fan. Lines go by quickly.",neutral,restaurant
171778,"Awful. Dining experiences are more than food. It's the overall; treatment, wait, friendliness, etc. 1) Why would you only leave two cashiers up front when there's a line 20 people deep? (From earlier review) 2) Why did the kid making my vanilla latte have a problem making me a half-caf? 3) Why is the back room so ice-cold? 4) Why is the service so sub-average? 5) Why did I come back? - A) Inexpensive pastries - B) decent product. ... But I stand firm on",neutral,restaurant
171812,"Their pastries are really good! But their customer service sucks! And for that reason I think I'm gonna take my business elsewhere. I called on Monday to ask about getting a cheesecake. They only have it by the slice which I can buy 8 slices to make up a whole cake. No problem. $3/slice of $24 for the whole cake. Verified their whole business hours since the COVID reopening and they said 10am - 6pm. I got off work at exactly 5:30pm the following day, start hauling ass and called them on my way, only to be told that they're closing early. This was around 5:40pm and I'm around the corner already. I asked why, and they said they ran out of bread. I told them I'm not buying bread. I'm buying a cake. And it's for a birthday gift. Didn't matter. They're closed. I decided to drive over anyways. Parked my car, and the door is locked with a sign posted that they are closed. There were about 4 other vehicles who parked while we were there and tried to go in but no luck. I had to tell them what I was told over the phone ""that they closed early because they ran out of bread"". Sucks to be then really. I started looking for other bakeries at that time and found one across the street. Better YELP reviews! Awesome customer service! Great prices!",neutral,restaurant
171825,"It's a cute place but just not sure what the ""hype"" is all about. There's nothing really unique about their pastries, cakes or drinks. I guess it's just another bakery to choose from but doesn't stand out as a ""the best"".",neutral,restaurant
171886,"This location is fairly new so I hope they improve. Ordered my Sea Salt Coffee and it was so watered down, the flavor had to be ""imagined"". Brioche bread was fine, some of the other rolls/muffins were too chewy-totally opposite of the light, flaky pastries the made 85° so popular. Those of us who are used to the original Orange County goods know better. Prices have increased a lot so step it up, people. Make this franchise outstanding.",neutral,restaurant
171908,"Actually I really like 85°C, but when I go this time, I find out they don't have many choices. I mean they only have half menu different bread. The worse is they use paper to wrap bread, not plastic bag anymore. I mean even paper bag is better. When I go back home, the bread come out from the paper wrap...",neutral,restaurant
171938,"It's ok, we've been going a lot since opening. Main complaint is the efficiency even when there isn't a line around the door. Takes a long time to get coffee or tea. Definitely go and check it out. But make sure you're not in a hurry. You'll be here a while",neutral,restaurant
171974,"Looking for ice cream in the area, came across Melt. We got the monster cookie which had multiple types of cookie chunks in it. Came in a cute Chinese take out box topped with a fortune cookie. Pretty basic with no additional options for topping for $7. Don't recommend if you are just looking for ice cream.",neutral,restaurant
171994,"2.28.2018 edit: A fellow yelper reached out and let me know that apparently Melt isn't in business anymore due to some conflicts with the landlord. I'll leave this review here until further notice. -- I've never written a review for somewhere I haven't even been to before. I tried coming here once at 10pm -- closed. I tried coming here a second time at 9pm -- closed. Today, I tried for a third time at 8:30pm -- closed. For somewhere that blatantly displays open hours until midnight, this makes no sense to me. I can't be so unlucky that I've come here the only three days Melt has been arbitrarily closed in the past few months. Would I chance coming here a fourth time? Eek, me thinks not.",neutral,restaurant
171998,"We had Melt on our list to try for a long time.. so long that by the time we decided to try it they had moved from their actual storefront and now have a stand in front of a coffee shop. Hey, rent can be rough, I get that. We still wanted to try the product! I will say, from the pictures of the previous place the flavor selection is far more limited. You can get a single or double scoop and that's really about it. They had some ring pops and candy cigarettes too. The girl working was super nice and took care of us quickly. We tried the peanut butter pretzel and the captain crunch berries. Both had decent flavor but the pretzel chunks and cereal chunks are naturally soggy once in the ice cream and I would have rather just had the flavor without the soggy bits. The consistency was okay. Sadly I don't know that we would return although our flavors were fine. It is sad that they have to just be a cart on the street now instead of what looked like a cool set up before. Perhaps they will find a more permanent location again in the future?",neutral,restaurant
172089,"I hadn't been to Melt in awhile and I swung by on the way home from work a few weeks ago. It seems like it's gone downhill quite a bit. They were out of almost every flavor and only had about 5 left. The shop seemed kind of dirty, and service wasn't the best. I had to wait a minute for an employee to come from the back to help me, and he seemed put out that he did. I got a basil sorbet for myself and some kind of chocolate flavor for my husband. My basil sorbet was really refreshing and the flavor was fantastic. My husband said his was just alright. I originally liked Melt because of their service and unique flavors. However, it seems like both are now lacking. If I was downtown and wanting ice cream, I'd choose Novel over Melt.",neutral,restaurant

I tried about 5 flavors and only really liked 2...the pineapple and mango. My friend got the cucumber one which tasted okay but had a weird texture, more like shaved ice than creamy. Portions are pretty big and each it comes in one of those Chinese to go boxes. Each box comes with a fortune cookie as well. Overall, I probably wouldn't go again on my own.",neutral,restaurant

172756,"With reviews like these, how could you not go? We were also surprised to see it was super close to our favorite sweet shop, B A Sweetie up the street so this was a no brainer. We got a half dozen. 2- chocolate peanut butter, 1 chocolate chocolate cream, 1 chocolate white cream, 1 maple bacon and 1 smore. I thought the smore looked like it had nuts on it but the hubby said it was graham crackers. When we got to the car we confirmed it was nuts. Since where are there nuts on smores? No graham crackers at all. We think given the caramel drizzled on top that it would be more aptly renamed a turtle donut. The hubby liked it though. I didn't care for the cream so I scraped mine off and we both were pretty turned off by the texture of the peanut butter cream. We're used to Buckeye Donuts and Jolly Pirates version and this just was too peanut buttery for me so I scraped mine off while the man enjoyed his. I have to say despite not liking the cream, we agreed the chocolate iced donut portions were really good. The maple bacon was awful and we didn't finish it. We agreed the bacon tasted fake like bacon bits over real bacon. The smell was really off putting before we even ate it so we won't be getting that one again. The donuts were decent but we just wouldn't say 5-star good. So, more for Clevelanders! FYI- Cash only.",neutral,restaurant

Generally, the ice cream flavors are good but in my opinion they are not exceptional. Additionally, don't be in a rush because on sunny days the line is long and it moves at a snail's pace. Honestly, this location needs to take a page out of the Chick-fil-A handbook and learn how to properly move a line. It would go a long way in improving the customer experience.",neutral,restaurant
172999,"Very much craft ice cream with some very unique flavors. I enjoyed it, but there is a lot going on, maybe too much in the flavors. Biggest pros were the fresh waffle cones (although they were very buttery) and the very friendly employees who had a well prepared statement about each flavor and made them all sound delicious. Biggest cons were, well the ice cream itself. Some of the flavors kind of gave me a food truck ""we are trying really hard to be extremely unique"" kind of vibe. Bangkok peanut ice cream is actually very spicy with a strong cayenne flavor. The sweet corn with blackberry tasted exactly how it sounds. I am definitely a fan of the brown butter almond brittle but a whole scoop of it is just too much. All in all, I would go back but I wouldn't seek it out or go out of my way, I certainly wouldn't wait in a line for 30 minutes again.",neutral,restaurant
173095,"I was not impressed. I really wanted to like the ice cream. I am a big fan of cold creamy concoction especially in the summer. It was just too over priced and did not seem like a good quality ice cream. That being said, I will try it at least once more.",neutral,restaurant

You order your ice cream on one side of the glass and the other side you see workers toiling away making your ice cream. I couldn't decide if I liked the feeling of this place because it felt very industrial and kinda cold. The ice cream was good and the portions were generous. However, I've had better ice cream and I didn't feel like this really hit the spot. We tried a good number of flavors and nothing really stood out. I vote Jeni's and because I'm not really from Columbus you can't say its Columbus pride. But I knew it was a bad sign because my sister, who loves loves loves ice cream, didn't even finish hers! Instead she left it in the cup holder next to my phone, waiting for me to dip my fingers in the slurry. Yuck.",neutral,restaurant
173708,"really nice, spacious, and clean ice cream shop. there is a big seating area for customers to sit at after they purchase the ice cream. they made their ice cream on site and they claimed all the ingredients are fresh and homemade. there is also a large selection of ice cream flavor more than most ice cream place offers. i ordered vanilla bean and mango sorbet. i also tried taste other flavor. overall, its ice cream is really creamy. to me why i gave a three stars instead of five stars bc to me the ice cream is too sweet and too creamy to me. if u have a really sweet tooth then this is probably the place for u. to me i felt there is too much sugar and butter added to its ice cream and kinda over power its original flavor like mango. such as the salt caramel i tried it is on the salty side. overall it is a nice ice cream place but just not for me.",neutral,restaurant
173747,"On a street packed with bars that close at 2am, this place closes at 11pm on Saturday. Genius. Good ice cream though.",neutral,restaurant
173772,"This place was busy for a Monday dinner hour. Tip: Take a number for service! I missed it when I entered and thought I was going to miss my chance at a cannoli. Luckily, I was able to snatch one and a creme brÃ»lÃ©e. The cannoli was overly sweet and felt dry eating through it. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e surprised me at how not sweet it was (which is a good thing!) The let down of the creme brÃ»lÃ©e is that that I know it's been sitting there for some time because the top doesn't crack as smoothly when it gets torched. It was meh, I would pass for another Bakery. Another tip: $5 minimum for credit card use.",neutral,restaurant
173837,"Presti's can be really hit or miss. It's definitely the most popular bakery in little Italy but it's a little overpriced and I haven't enjoyed all of the bakery items I've tried. I would definitely suggest sticking to the cassata cake, cannolis or their assortment of Italian cookies, which seem to be pretty consistent in quality. They do have a wide range of food items including baked sweets, gelato, hot drinks and hot prepared food and they are a convenient dessert stop if you are grabbing dinner in little Italy.",neutral,restaurant
173881,"Been here a bunch of times over the years and was never that impressed by its offerings, but figured I would give it another shot since it had been awhile. If I'm being honest the baked goods look much better than they taste. The chocolate chip cookies were rather average, and hard, which I prefer soft to. The Napoleon was bland and didn't even come close to comparing to Farka's in Ohio City. Oh well.",neutral,restaurant
173884,Meh! Crazy busy at 730 pm on a Sat night. Very noisy. Tried a cannoli and a chocolate torte with cannoli filling. The torte was mediocre at best. Cannoli was ok but I've had better. Very overrated on my opinion!,neutral,restaurant
173898,"I have been to this bakery ranging from times when it was very busy to when it was not busy at all. Regardless of the unpredicted chaos, the staff was always courteous. In terms of the bakery items, there was nothing there that really knocked my socks. I did try different bakery items around the country so I don't know if i happen to compare the different items unfairly. However, this is still a go to place for most people in the area especially the students. This place is a walkable distance from the University Circle, and the items are very reasonably priced. This place also has lunch items (which I personally did not try) and has a very large seating area.",neutral,restaurant
173943,"They were extremely crowded on a 3 PM Friday afternoon how to draw a number to get service ended up getting quite a selection as there are a lot of items to choose from. Staff is very friendly. got the chocolate walnut hazelnut cake the pistachio chocolate cake, cannoli cake, Napoleon, German chocolate cake,cappuccino brownie and the lemon coconut cake. to be totally honest none of them were good they werent offensively bad per se but lacked flavor. my main issue was with the Napoleon, as this is my favorite dessert. this was literally not a Napoleon. it had the traditional Napoleon topping but then the body of it was chocolate mousse and with a very very thin layer of cream and phyllo. so that was a huge disappointment. the other cakes also didn't taste like what they were advertised to especially the pistachio cake and just in general weren't very good they all had the mousse and maybe it's a personal issue I have with mousse. The German chocolate cake also just wasn't very sweet and the cappuccino brownie we a-likened to a Costco brownie it just honestly to me tasted like Betty Crocker- it did not taste special and it did not have a coffee flavor at all. I feel bad being so critical because it was a really beautiful store and the desserts are all very aesthetic but I just don't think it was worth it especially for the price which ended up being about $36. The quality was like a grocery store.",neutral,restaurant
173951,"Ehhh, I don't see the hype honestly. Maybe is was just my particular order (Chicken Parm), but the meal was extremely basic and the taste did not match the price. I also felt that this place isn't very clear (as someone unfamiliar with this establishment), where you need to go to order once you walk in. I was told I needed to get a ticket by another customer, and it took me a while to actual find the ticket dispenser... and then I was unsure if I needed to wait in the line they were in, or a separate one. Well, anyways, the girl who helped me out was extremely friendly and got my food ready fairly quickly. She also assisted me in telling me where there was an outlet to temporarily charge my phone while I ate. I was visiting Cleveland for the first time and definitely screwed up coming here and ordering the Chicken Parm. I definitely think I should have gotten something else... this place seems popular and was packed every time I passed it!",neutral,restaurant
174009,"Food fairly good for Italian bakery. My taste buds may be spoiled by the tastes from Boston, New York, and Italy though. Large variety of pastries and gelatos, also have some hot foods. Good amount of seating but bit loud to really have easy conversation. Service fast and efficient. They should wear hair nets though.",neutral,restaurant
174132,"It was a cold summer day in Cleveland. (I love the fact that that occurs here...) Walking briskly around Little Italy, we happened into this little cafe, drawn in by the tempting word: Gelato. I have no idea how the canolis, bread, sandwiches, or stromboli taste... but I know the Gelato is pretty good. While service wasn't warm, it wasn't bad. The decor is light and cheerful, and despite numerous other empty restaurants nearby, this one was mostly full. So, despite mediocre service, we had good gelato, and colour us satiated. :)",neutral,restaurant
174163,"Hadn't been here for a couple if yrs but stopped today & was disappointed. Never found ticket disperser, older lady waited on me was a bit rude. Peanut butter bars tasted like they had canned frosting on them..kinda gross. Not what it used to be. I'll go elsewhere next week.",neutral,restaurant
174174,"When I went to school in Case Western, I went to Presti to get lunch very often. However, the taste is really just normal. The most terrible thing is the servers' speed is extremely slow!!!! It takes them 10 minutes to just get you a piece of pizza. They have enough people work there though, Those people just slow!",neutral,restaurant
174212,"I can at least say that the food here was great. We had their egg and cheese croissant sandwiches and I purchased a few sweet things to go, some cookies and macaroons, all delicious.... but the service, goodness gracious, it was awful. We stood in line for literally a half an hour before we could place our order. They had a number dispenser but half of the staff was calling numbers and half of them weren't. Behind the counter seemed completely disorganized and they only had one register running during the breakfast rush on a Sunday! Most of the workers were just standing around not even helping people! One lady kept yelling out, ""if you're paying in cash I can help you"", so I stepped forward and started placing my order and she ignored me, looked right past me and yelled, ""Oh Melvin good to see you again, hows the family"" Clearly she preferred the business of her regular customer rather than I, a tourist. It was so freaking rude. Finally when I got to place my order I wasn't even finished making my order and she started having a conversation with a coworker! Seriously, WTF was wrong with this woman. Then it took forever for them to heat up the sandwiches. Their food may be good but their service and organization needs a serious overhaul. Maybe that's a typical Italian Deli for you, I don't know. But in the great state of Indiana, we have manners.",neutral,restaurant
174346,Cute little shop. I went in for the first time because I was nearby. Limited selection of treats. I got the chocolate peanut butter cake. It was just ok. Rich chocolate flavor and the pb comes through. Negative is that my slice was dry. It wasn't the most moist slice of cake for $7+. I'd rate the slice a 6/10. Not the worst slice but also not the best.,neutral,restaurant
174386,"Hello guys! I decided to pay this bakery a visit due to delicious macarons that they had in the pics. They did not disappoint by the way! But they have a cute little store. You might ride past it if you are going too fast but otherwise you won't miss it. It was my daughters birthday weekend so I wanted to get her some macarons because she loves them. They did not have a big selection but there was a variety to choose from. I then noticed the massive cakes that they had displayed. OMG! They looked so delicious. I wanted a slice of the chocolate cake because that is here favorite, but could not get it because there was actually a fly in the display case. Got to be more aware of the flies! They are sneaky! And we really wanted that cake! But she chose the red velvet instead. Now I am from Georgia so red velvet hits a little different for me. With that being said I did not really like it. I ate some but not all. But the macarons were great! We got the Nutella and the almond. Will definitely go back for those very soon! My daughter also decided to try the some kind of rainbow cookie. She loved it but I did not. I also noticed that they had cheesecake in the fridge as well. I'm definitely interested in return to try their other delectable delights!",neutral,restaurant
174390,"I've been here several times and I've enjoyed some of their desserts, especially the oatmeal cookies! They're very friendly and the service is great! The dessert are very hearty which is nice considering most places serve very tiny portions when it comes to dessert. I am however not pleased with their macaroons as they all taste the same and have a stale taste to them. The Tiramisu is delicious! As are most of their cakes! They have their own small parking area so you can run in and out whenever you have a sweet craving!",neutral,restaurant
174427,I love going for the baked goods. The drinks on the other hand always come out inconsistent. The specialty drinks are always luke warm and only taste like milk. It seems like this is a recent change as I used to love coming for the coffee.,neutral,restaurant
174487,"HIT -AND- MISS My Wife & I are former NY'ers of Italian descent, so we were excited to try Villani's. The Bakery concept is nice; the server was really nice, and they have several items - though the availability of items rotates. Part of what I had deserved 5 stars, and the other part of what I had earned a single star. The rainbow cookies were five star perfection, as was the pastry part of what comprises their St Joseph's pastry (which I think the clerk referred to as Sfingi). How do you describe the perfect rainbow cookie? Villani's. Likewise, the Sfingi pastry was fluffy without being too light; a perfect balance, and tasty - a five star pastry that could go head to head with anything in NY. Literally. May I also add that everything was fresh, which is also uncommon. The filling of the St Joseph/Sfingi, and the filling of the cannoli, was a disaster. In my life I have tasted different types of cannoli filling made from ricotta, with different bakeries flavoring the filling with nuts, chocolate chips, etc. I have had cannoli filling that is sometimes too sweet, and cannoli filling that leaned towards ricotta tasting. The cannoli shell at Villani's tasted like a fried noodle from a Chinese restaurant, formed in the shape of a cannoli shell. Both the Sfingi filling, and cannoli filling, tasted like unsweetened heavy cream with a touch of cinnamon. The consistency was good, but the taste was very unexpected. In my 40 something years of eating Italian desserts, I have never had anything like this, and I didn't find it tasty. So...IMHO, Villani's was a hit and miss; what Villani's got right, they got right in a way that's worth bragging over. Unfortunately, what they got wrong was likewise extreme. 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3 stars, as I believe that Villani's makes a deliberate effort in serving up fresh, quality, items. The cannoli shell and filling were a HUGE miss, unfortunately.",neutral,restaurant

174667,"Ok yelpers that live on Willy St, let's be honest here... Sweets are so sweet that you may as well just eat sugar. Tried apple pie, blueberry muffin and russian tea cookie. Went there shortly before they close and the only reason why 3 and not 2 stars because they gave free baguette and it was good. Will try more breads in the future.",neutral,restaurant
174833,Not really crazy about the ice cream. Some flavors are cloyingly sweet and hard to finish. Then there's the ingredients. This ice cream always tastes like it's got stabilizers and gums (and who knows what else) in it which I really don't like in my ice cream.,neutral,restaurant
174844,"I was very excited to try this place after hearing its Madison's most famous ice cream shop. I was very pleased at the selection of flavors and the size of their scoops were pretty big! A single scoop here is probably comparable to 1.5 scoops at other ice cream establishments. The flavors of ice cream was good, but I like my ice cream texture more creamy and this place seemed comparable to store bought ice cream. Nonetheless a delicious stop for any occasion!",neutral,restaurant

Service was not very accommodating tarnishing the Great name of Ghirardelli's Ended up only with a scoop of mint chocolate chip disappointing that with no room ate ice cream standing up outside lol,neutral,restaurant
174968,"If you want a quick ice cream pick up, this is a great location to go to. It's a very relaxed ice cream date spot located in the Linq area. It think it's a great quality ice cream and chocolate sauce. But gave it a 3 star for the price being too over priced. It's a chocolate shop at the same time. There's only a few tables, but it does not get crowded enough where you don't have a place to sit.",neutral,restaurant
174981,"I went here for dessert with a friend after dinner at Yardhouse. As usual, we were given small sample bits of chocolate (Milk Chocolate Caramel, this time!) and it is delicious, as always. I appreciate the complimentary water cooler in the back of the store, which was much needed after this sample and the Las Vegas heat. The man at the door was quite lovely and offered to answer any questions or help with our dessert selection. While I was stuffed from dinner, my friend ordered a simple vanilla soft-serve with butterscotch topping...this took 10 minutes to receive. Now, the butterscotch was quite generous and delicious, but on a slower Wednesday evening with several (2-3) employees 'lounging' at the cash wrap, while one made all the sundaes I was disappointed in the service for such a simple order. Even so, that chocolate can't be beat!",neutral,restaurant
174990,"It was my good luck that the day I happened to walk in, it was National Sundae Day and they were offering half priced hot fudge sundae's for that day only. Good thing it was half price! The normal price is over $12 for a sundae, which I think is outrageous. I was happy to pay $6 and change. The hot fudge was thick and decadent, but I've definitely had better ice cream. As I sat and ate, I watched as people walked in and were given a free Ghirardelli chocolate square. Where was mine?",neutral,restaurant
175011,"I was too excited to see Ghirardelli as they are hard to come by, however, all my hopes and dreams were ripped away with the staff from this location. The staff was not friendly and very slow. They had no sense of urgency with a room full of waiting customers. No smile, no greeting, no energy. The ice cream itself is always great 5/5 recommend! All the sundaes are devine. The whipped cream is my ultimate favorite. They are never shy with any toppings! However, one shouldn't wait 20 minutes for ice cream. Sometimes the staff overweights the overall experience. Come to this location if you do not mind poor service and have time to wait.",neutral,restaurant
175083,"You'll get the same chocolate and ice cream here as you would at any other Ghirardelli, but most of the time when you come in, you'll have to sacrifice a good bit of your personal space. We managed to find enough space for ten people in the shop and everyone enjoyed what they ordered, especially the younger ones in our group. We came in on a Tuesday night around 9 PM and there wasn't too much room inside. Even if it was just my wife and I, we would have had a difficult time finding a place to sit. So if you come for some ice cream, don't be surprised if you order and have to finish your dessert elsewhere. After the previous patrons got up, we cleaned the table ourselves and everyone had a seat but we were bumping elbows with the parties next to us and had other customers hovering over our table as they waited to place their order. We ordered nine items and everything came out in a timely manner. Four of the orders were just single scoops of ice cream with total bill being $70. All of the sundaes are served in plastic cups instead of the customary sundae glasses with long spoons which even though they probably weren't, makes it seem like the portions are smaller. I had the Ocean Beach which was s nice combination of vanilla ice cream, caramel, hot fudge, and sea salt. By the way, if you're with a group and thinking about ordering the The Earthquake, don't do it. We've done it before and it's a sloppy mess and nowhere near worth the $30+ price tag. There are better places for ice cream in the city but if you're in the LINQ and just can't get up and go elsewhere, Ghirardelli should work as long as you can handle the masses and elevated prices.",neutral,restaurant
175090,"Overpriced for what you get on ice cream. $12 for a 2 scoop hot fudge sundae in a 16 ounce plastic cup. The ice cream is just ok. Looks a lot better than it tastes. They don't give you a lot of ice cream and they smear the hot fudge on the sides of the cup to make it ""look like"" you are getting a lot fudge. You are buying the name. Ben & Jerry's is a lot better!! They do have a great selection of candy at the store.",neutral,restaurant
175099,"Their chocolate is top quality. Love their ice cream sundaes and their service. Huge selection and they constantly come up with new flavors. Free sample for coming in, nice touch.

175240,"An update is overdue for this place for a couple of reasons. For one, I didn't review the birthday confetti cake which is quite legit. Sad to say that most cakes in America are t that great to me, but the chocolate birthday cake was a pleasant surprise. The chocolate was not too sweet and was rich with the perfect amount of cream cheese frosting to balance it all out. There's been some new investors, hence, the famous ""crack pie"" has a new name now and they've gotten rid of the cereal milk soft serve with crack pie pieces. Or maybe that was an insider menu item but they offer you to buy them separately and make your own soft serve with the ""crack pie"" pieces. Bring it back, though, because it's a unique masterpiece. If you're a chocolate lover, the chocolate birthday cake gets a solid 5 stars, and I'd pick it over the white confetti.",neutral,restaurant
175252,"This place unfortunately did not impress me as much as I was hoping it would. We tried a variety of things: crack pie latte, Birthday latte, one whole crack pie, cereal milk ice cream, and birthday truffles. Needless to say, we spent a pretty penny. The ice cream did initially taste like vanilla but then shifted into a cereal milk aftertaste which I found unique. This is probably what I was most impressed with. The crack pie latte is, as you can imagine, extremely sugary. It is without a doubt the most sugary lattes I've ever had and we were not able to finish either latte because of how sweet it was. Unfortunately, the problem was that all I can taste is sweetness and there was no unique or even coffee flavor. If you're wondering what the crack pie tastes like, just imagine pecan pie. It basically tastes exactly the same and I honestly don't think it was worth the money. I'd rather go to Cosco and get a big, thick pecan pie. The slice was so tiny and so thin with not that much filling in it, I don't think it was worth it. One slice is around seven dollars and one whole pie is $52, not worth it. The birthday truffles were really good, they tasted like cake pops with sprinkles but once again, I don't think it was worth the price.",neutral,restaurant
175300,"Wanted a sweet cheat treat while at Cosmo. Found milkbar. Menu overwhelming but fun. I ordered the pint $18 and birthday milkshake. The pint was swirl ice cream with cornflakes and sprinkles. This thing was waaaaaay too sweet. And it was messy, spilling on the sides. Why bother to put the cap on when it's going to melt. The cap just wasn't functional. The birthday milkshake was super small for $10 and I wouldn't order that again. It cost way too much, not worth the value and the pint was super messy. If I came back here, it would be for the cakes or cookies.",neutral,restaurant
175371,"Heard about this place through Instagram. We had family in town, so during our once-a-year-sort-of-forced-trip-to-the-strip, we went to the Cosmopolitan for dinner. Ended up walking by Milk Bar after our meal and decided to give it a try. I ended up buying 6 cookies for $22.00 - confetti, fruity marshmallow, cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow, chocolate chocolate, compost, and blueberry & cream. The texture of these cookies were odd. They were chewy but tasted like they were losing their freshness. The chocolate chocolate was the worst because it tasted like nothing! The fruity marshmallow was the best one, even though it was a little too sweet. Maybe they would have tasted better with some of their ice cream, but I don't see myself going back there anytime soon. On a side note, customer service was excellent and friendly. The cashier who helped us gave us an overview of their menu and pointed out the cookies that were the most popular. Again, unless I am at the Cosmopolitan again (chances of that being slim to none), I most likely will not be back.",neutral,restaurant
175377,"Anybody familiar with Milk Bar's origins shouldn't be surprised to see their Las Vegas location next door to Momofuku, just like in NYC. I've been a big fan of both founders for some time and couldn't wait to try both, even if it was one of their outposts. Inadequate planning kept me out of Momofuku on my recent trip to Sin City, but I was able to try Milk Bar for the first time. It was split decision. We managed to hop into a relatively short line knowing right away what we were going to try. I have been hearing about the famous Milk Bar Pie, aka Crack Pie, for ages. I even almost ordered one on Goldbelly for mail order deliver awhile back, but couldn't talk myself into the expensive FedEx fee on top of a $51 pie (btw, they don't do mail order w/ Goldbelly now, they have their own website). She wanted to try the Cereal Milk soft serve. We were also going to grab some cookies to go for later as well, but seeing how the cookies were packaged and handled we decided against them. In fact, the whole packaging and presentation was a bit unexpected. Everything was packaged like something you would get when the goods were not made on-site. I could totally picture this stuff in a high-end grocery store. We were expecting fresh made stuff. So we passed on the cookies and took a slice of the pie and the ice cream for $12.50 plus tax and tip. We found a seat nearby (they don't have their own seating), and dug in. The pie slice was very small, but considering the ingredients and the 300 calories quoted on the label, this was probably an adequate single serving. The pie was in a little box, like a McDonald's Apple Pie. Removing it I found the slice to be extremely cold, possibly over chilled, like not quite Sara Lee frozen pie cold, but headed in that direction. The taste was disappointing. My senses wanted to fire, but something was off. She took a bite and gave her unsolicited appraisal, ""the butter is stale."" Yeah, it had that taste. When I made it to the back edge, there was a little more of the oat cookie crust, some of it not so compressed. That tasted pretty good. I'm not sure if I got a bad piece or I just have bad taste, but I don't get it. This was a disappointment. 1/10. I took a few bites of her Cereal Milk Ice Cream and it was fantastic. It was appropriately named. The malty flavor with the creamy sweetness tasted just like the milk in the bottom of a bowl of Corn Flakes or Rice Krispies. This stuff is so simple it's brilliant. 9/10. I'll get the ice cream again if given the chance. I'm glad I didn't order a whole pie mail-order. Still not sure about the cookies.",neutral,restaurant
175419,"I came here because they are so instagram famous, and unfortunately fell for the hype. They are located in Cosmo, next to eggslut ( another overrated place which I do not like). They had already run out of many items because we didn't get there till around 8pm at night. I got the birthday cake, cereal milk soft serve, crack cake, and compost cookie. The cereal milk soft serve tasted exactly like leftover cereal milk, which is my favorite part of eating cereal. The crack pie was delicious, super sweet, and rich. Crack pie is almost exactly the same as chess pie, I think it only got so popular because of the name ""crack"". I am not completely convinced that this was a brand new recipe because I have been to plenty of bakeries in the south that have a chess pie that taste exactly the same. This cake is very easy to make and super affordable, so paying so much for such a small slice felt so unsavory. The birthday cake and compost cookie fell through though, the birthday cake tasted like any regular birthday cake out of the box. It was not worth the $14, the compost cookie was really dry and not that great tasting at all. In fact all of the cookies looked really dry and gross. I took a chance and bought the cookie but I regretted it. So save yourself a trip unless you really really want to try the soft serve.",neutral,restaurant
175434,"Horrible customer service by Ingrid. Ordered some milkshakes, 1 cookie and 1 slice of cake. She was acting as if we were ordering the most complicated stuff in the menu! Rolling her eyes and giving us attitude. The milkshakes and cake were good.",neutral,restaurant
175449,"Visited Milk Bar after stumbling upon it at the Cosmopolitan. We've seen documentaries on the story behind this bakery so we figured we had to try it out. We tried: -Crack Pie- super dense and tasted a lot like toffee / heath flavor. Not bad but overpriced and too sweet for us. You could only have a few bites and definitely need a glass of water or milk nearby. -Compost cookie- very dense and lots of textures. Not bad but nothing special in our opinion. -Frozen cereal milk ice cream- the star of this visit. It really tastes like cereal milk! It was creamy and delicious and worth the $6 they charge per cup. Staff was friendly and there wasn't any wait. Overall, the place is cute and there's a lot of cool concepts. Some of the flavors are just a tad bit too sweet and prices were on the higher side for what the portions and taste actually delivered. Worth a visit maybe if you have a sweet tooth or if you are a big fan of cereal milk!",neutral,restaurant
175451,"Favorite thing at Milk Bar is hands down their corn cookie - sounds weird but don't knock it until you try it! The cook is soft and buttery, the perfect texture and right amount of sweet. I like the cereal milk ice cream but a sample of it is plenty for me. The fruity pebbles flavor is uncanny - literally liquid cereal. If you're looking to try the infamous Milk Bar and haven't made it to NYC, I love how accessible this location is. Also I've visited numerous times and there has never been a line!",neutral,restaurant
175482,"I was excited to try this place out after seeing all the photos and hearing about all the hype. Many years ago my dad had brought home a compost cookie from NY after a business trip and I remember it tasting sooo good. I was excited to be able to try it again. My husband and I shared a cereal milk soft serve with cornflakes topping and a compost cookie. Maybe it's the hype but I don't really understand how the cereal milk is so popular. The cereal milk flavor is pretty subtle and the cornflakes completely overpower the taste. I personally thought the cornflakes were much too salty and I didn't really care too much for it. Also, it's quite expensive too--an extra $1 just for some cornflakes!! The compost cookie was pretty good but not as good as my memory makes me believe. It didn't taste that fresh and was also a bit too sweet. I like it but I'll probably pass in the future...$3 is a bit too much for a cookie that didn't blow me away. Overall, this place is definitely hyped up. Prices are high and it's not really worth it. If I ever come back again I'll probably try the Crack Pie that everyone is talking about.",neutral,restaurant
175487,"After watching the Netflix special, I've been really looking forward to trying the place, so we had to make a detour prior to seeing Bruno Mars. The location is more of a bar, not a cafe, so not as spacious as a traditional location. I got a slice on their signature cake, which came at a pretty price of $14. While I understand that all prices in Vegas are inflated, I was not blown away - it was good, but nothing to give it that extra wow factor that would warrant the price. We also tried the cookies, while good - were all individual wrapped in plastic. I could understand the packaging option for people wanting to take some baked goods to bring home, but for enjoying in the moment - the plastic was annoying because I was wanting something fresh from the counter. Overall fun experience, nice presentation - but not worth a detour.",neutral,restaurant
175500,"Cookies are good and it kinda taste like rice crispy. It's $4 each for cookies and it's not even big. Chocolate truffle my favorite, chocolatey inside and the outer cover taste soo good but I don't know what it is. It just super good. Crack pie is small, pricey and tastes okay. The crack pie soft serve is good too. No need for toppings. I had a hard time deciding and reading their menu. The two ladies was like rushing me.",neutral,restaurant
175502,"I have been wanting to try this place for quite awhile, especially with the Christina Tosi's showcase on Chef's Table. Now, I have never been to the original but if the food tastes like it did here, I would be disappointed after having heard such good things. Overall, this place gets a 2.5 stars from me. When approaching the counter, I always thought it was weird that the cookies were individually packaged. Perhaps that's better for this type of establishment or maybe it's an excuse to jack up the price a bit more but it made everything seem premade and not fresh. My date and I got three cookies (chocolate chocolate, compost, and cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow) and some chocolate soft-serve. We also sampled two other types of soft-serve. Regardless of which flavor we tried, they all had a sour taste to them which to me was off-putting. The three cookies all had a very nice texture, firm but soft, essentially the perfect cookie texture. I have a hard time picking which was my favorite because honestly they all tasted very similar. They too had that slightly sour flavor profile that was present in the soft-serve. It must be the cereal milk...Anyway, the cookies were good and I did enjoy them but were nowhere near the best I've had; they were just different. The chocolate chocolate honestly did not even taste like chocolate which seemed really odd to me. I would normally think that I came on an off day but seeing as how they are all pre-packaged, this must be how they all are. It's a very weird feeling for me. I'm disappointed but I also want future cookies I eat to have the same texture as these.",neutral,restaurant
175505,I had high expectations for milk bar but it was just OK. It reminded me of Honeymee but not even as good. Good to try once. I did hope they would have the blueberry cake but unfortunately not this time around.,neutral,restaurant
175510,"No longer so impressive. Has Tosi released herself from active management of the LV place? From the last two visits, I feel that the quality of the cookies have really taken a fall-- like off the cliff of deliciousness. For the price of the desserts charged, I would expect better offerings.... not dry, bad QC wrapped desserts for take home. Even the soft serve thing I tried, meh. At best!",neutral,restaurant
175525,"I was so hyped to visit this spot after watching the Milk Bar episode on Netflix. The cake truffles definitely lived up to my expectations, but I was the only one in my group that seemed to really love them. They gave them to my sister for free since it was her birthday. I thought that was a nice touch. The soft serve itself...I did not love. I have to add that I don't actually love the milk left after you've devoured a bowl of cereal, so that may give you some perspective on my opinion. The soft serve just didn't live up to my sweet expectations of ice cream. Think soft serve but with mild sweetness.",neutral,restaurant
175544,"I've been to the one in Los Angeles I wanted to give this one a try. I got the cookie that had marshmallow, chocolate, and cereal pieces. It was chewy and very tasty. It was a five dollar cookie which is very expensive to me.",neutral,restaurant
175573,"But sure, let's just say 3.5 stars because it's a fun concept! Our girl gang enjoyed a concert at Planet Hollywood and walked to the Cosmo on a mission to find the cereal soft serve and crack pie. The line was insane, even at 10pm. We ordered exactly what we wanted plus one compost cookie to share. For the cereal soft serve, I've never been and still am not a huge fan of corn flakes; but I get the contrast and whatnot. I do think nostalgia is worth the hype and the pricing is probably more about aesthetics. Who doesn't love the good 'ol simple times? Overall, everything tasted like a straight up spoonful of sugar in every bite. I couldn't finish any single order by myself, my sweetness tolerance is definitely dwindling with age.",neutral,restaurant
175591,"The hype of Milk Bar is so real and really got to me. Made the trek over here late at night after dinner really hoping to enjoy their Cereal Milk soft serve. Luckily I also bought a Compost cookies because I was really disappointed with the soft serve. I got samples of their Chocolate Pretzel and Crack Pie - Chocolate Pretzel was overly salty while Crack Pie was overly sweet. I ended up ordering their Cereal Milk soft serve and added on the cornflake topping for an extra $1something. Regrets. Cereal Milk tasted like cereal milk, but creamier, less sweet. Nothing worth noting. That extra $1something on the cereal should've gone to slot machines or something - crunchy, yes; overly salty, yes! It just took away from my enjoyment of the soft serve. However, Compost Cookie is great - a thick kind of chewy, with the different flavors of salty potato chips and sweet chocolate chips and graham crackers and all other kind of desserts come together to create a pretty good color.",neutral,restaurant
175594,I had the birthday cake and birthday cake balls and both were just meh. It was okay but not amazing for a $14 slice of cake. It was my birthday when I bought it and was kindly given the cake balls but i wasn't a fan honestly. Maybe next time but that slice on my big day didn't make the cut.,neutral,restaurant
175599,"I came to milk bar with my family after eating at block 16 food court . My little sister ( 7 years old ) ordered the cereal milk ice cream with sprinkles . We also ordered a few cookies ( corn, cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow , compost) . The cookies were soft and good size . The corn cookie was just ok . The compost cookie was good but it had a coffee flavor so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like coffee. The cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow cookie was my favorite . It was sweet and salty. I've tried other cereal milk ice cream flavors that I like better but this one was ok . It wasn't that sweet . My little sister did not like the ice cream at all . I would give this place another shot and try something else but I don't think I would recommend it for kids because the flavors are pretty unique and different for certain young palates .",neutral,restaurant
175602,"I really wanted to like this place. I MEAN really, really wanted to be a raging fan just like everyone else but honestly, it's all hype to me. Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, the Milk Bar has located next to Momofuku. I have visited Milk Bar on many occasions and have tried a variety of different desserts. I have had the birthday cake, soft serve cereal milk, a milk shake, the infamous crack pie, and all of the cookies (blueberry, compost, cornflake)-- but none of them were impressive. I have gifted the cookies to my family when I went home to visit, and even they were underwhelmed by the taste and the quality. The cookies were dry and flavorless. For the price of the cookie gift set, I was hoping for at least one winner in batch but none of them were THAT memorable. The birthday cake was good but other than it being cute it was pretty much funfetti cake mix (yeah, I'm sorry but I just had to say it). The crack pie was something that I thought that I would like, but meh. It tasted just okay and the oil seeping through the packaging wasn't very appetizing. Maybe it is because the items here at the Milk Bar come at a premium price and the quality just doesn't match? Either way, I found myself disappointed visit after visit. Milk Bar will survive in Vegas because of its reputation and tourists will keep on coming to get those Instagram likes but I don't see locals going out of their way to give this place a return visit. I still have hope that the one in New York will win my foodie heart over. See, I told you I really wanted to like this place.",neutral,restaurant
175606,"Oh Milk Bar, I originally loved the idea of you because I adore Christina Tosi, but that feeling quickly faded as I bit into your cookies and truffles, and licked the soft serve flavors from the sample cups. I was excited to see a Milk Bar in Vegas because I was under the impression that they only had stores in NYC. We bought the malt chocolate and bday truffles and both flavors were chalky, dry, and disappointing in taste. I usually enjoy ""birthday cake"" flavors, however the birthday truffle tasted overly fake-sweet, if that makes any sense to you. Ordered several cookies (compost, confetti, cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow, chocolate chocolate) and my favorite was actually the confetti cookie. The texture and taste of the cookies are similar to the truffles - dry, chalky, lacked any real flavor, etc., so I just could not comprehend the hype around this store. I sampled the soft serve flavors and didn't think any of them were worth buying a full cup's worth. In my opinion, the truffles and cookies are too expensive and not worth the high price tag. This store is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan next to Momofuku. I know that Milk is known for their cakes, so maybe I just have to give those a try instead. I'm not sure if I will ever go out of the way to visit a Milk Bar again, but I am glad that I can finally say that I have been to one of Christina Tosi's shops!",neutral,restaurant
175614,"Not a whole lot of variety on the menu (even less if you don't do alcohol)... cereal milk flavor was a nice treat, and cereal in the milkshake is even better. A little overpriced, and the shake size is a little small.",neutral,restaurant
175619,"The cashier was not super nice she seemed rushed and we were bothering her. I ordered the ""crack pie"" and the ""blueberry and cream"" cookie. The pie was super sweet! It's sorta like a pecan pie with out the pecans. It was good but nothing I would go out of my way for. The blueberry cookie was good once again was pretty sweet. I don't think I would go there just for that. I also sampled the soft serve.. the white one was horrible and the brownish one was ok.. sorry they were my friends samples so I don't what the flavors were. I don't know if I would treck the strip just to come back here but if I'm in the area I I might stop and try something new.",neutral,restaurant
175627,"I stumbled upon Momofuku & Milk Bar side-by-side at the Cosmo & thought I'd hit my head & woken up on the other coast. This is the furthest west I've ever seen these New York staples. For old times sake & because I love giving into unhealthy habits, I ordered a slice of Crack Pie. Served cold, the tiny, flat triangle flavored of butterscotch (& other sweet flavors I can't pinpoint) packs a sweet wallop for its size. If you can stomach parting with $7 for a few bites of dessert, Milk Bar's Crack Pie is a pretty good one to throw your money at.",neutral,restaurant
175644,It's VERY creamy and I thought very sweet but good. I order birthday cake soft serve and it comes with sprinkles but wish I got fruit pebbles cereal to cut the sweetness. The peppermint bark shake was awesome. The service was quick.,neutral,restaurant
175649,"Hmm.I have been hearing about Milk Bar for a long time and finally had the opportunity to try without having to stand in line! I ordered the Gluten free cookie, but unfortunately at least for me, it was nothing quite special and just a mediocre cookie. Perhaps their other items are better?",neutral,restaurant
175679,"I was excited to try this place out and thought it was okay. They don't make the cookies there as it is shipped from New York, so don't expect fresh cookies here. They are all prepackaged which sucks as I can go my local bakery for fresh cookies. The positive thing is they have very unique flavors which is the draw here. I guess if you want it fresh, fly to New York. The birthday truffle was yum and the crack pie good, reminded me of butter cake. I tried their soft serve crack pie and it was ok. It just melts quickly and they put it in a small container. Or, maybe I just lick my ice cream way too slow..*shrug* Would I be back? Uuummm..I would if I was passing by but wouldn't go out of my way to get something here.",neutral,restaurant
175703,"3.5. I'm super torn because some was great and some was not. First off the Crack Pie is amazing. I mean amazing. I savored every bite. But after that things just kind of went downhill .... slightly all be it... but still down. The cereal milk with corn flakes was ok but I really wanted the fruity pebbles, and they don't do that anymore. It does honestly taste like cereal milk. My husband had the shake version and I had the sundae. His was better. The cookies were ok tasting but very hard. Maybe we got a bad batch? The truffles were not good in my opinion. I didn't get the slice of cake and I really wanted to so I may be back to try that out next time I'm in town.",neutral,restaurant
175721,"My friend recommended this place and told me their soft serve ice cream are good. So I came with high expectations. We ordered cereal milk with extra corn flakes topping and a crake pie soft serve. The ice cream was very creamy, especially the crake pie flavor. But i think it is lacking some in depth flavor in the ice cream. The first few bit was good but you can get board easily. Maybe I was expecting too much to when we finally got it it was a little disappointing.",neutral,restaurant
175736,"Three stars only because it's highly overpriced and for a place that's probably on every dessert foodie's bucket list, I know they can do better. I bet there was hard work involved in making this cereal milk-flavored soft serve, but it is not worth $7. You can buy yourself a more wholesome meal with $7... But anyways, about the cereal milk soft serve that I got: it seriously tastes great. I did not realize that I enjoyed the milk that comes with having Frosted Flakes soaked in soggy the bowl for a while - the idea of that sounds kind of gross, but Milk's genius in this soft serve is marketing this into something that sounds totally palatable. However, the texture is kind of weird - very light, grainy, but also borderline melting. It didn't really hold its shape and soon after I got mine, I had to scoop up puddles of cereal milk from the cup with the inconvenient wooden popsicle sticks they give you for a spoon lol. The extra sprinkles were kind of expensive too, but I've never had anything like them - they were super crunchy and I loved them. It really added the much needed texture to the soupy soft serve. So, basically, I think the only reason why Milk Bar's cereal milk soft serve is so expensive is because of the unique flavor, but nothing else. So, if you have an ice cream maker and can concoct your own cereal milk flavor, then save money and make your own :)",neutral,restaurant
175739,This place is a hit or miss. My favorite is the cornflake cookies and crack pie. Everything else is either too salty or overwhelmingly sweet.,neutral,restaurant
175754,"As of late, a lot of East Coast staples have been gracing Sin City with their presence. Starting with White Castle, Shake Shack, Halal Guys and most recently Christina Tosi's Milk Bar. People can now enjoy this cult classic at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, their very first store opened in the west coast. Like the ones that have come before, this too have been plagued with cheers and jeers. So how good is this place really? It's up for debate. Personally for me, I give it 3 solid stars. I decided to get the Greatest hits combo $19 to have that variety: 3 birthday truffle, a cookie of your choice (opted for the compost), a slice of Crack pie and a cereal milk soft serve with cornflakes. On a couple of subsequent visits I've tried their passion fruit and chocolate truffles, cornflake marshmallow cookie and chocolate chocolate cookie. None of which blew my mind. They were all fairly good but nothing stood out and not something I would go out of my way for.",neutral,restaurant
175758,"Tried this and was a bit disappointed as everything was mass produced. The cookies were packaged in bags and were not fresh. The cereal milk soft serve was okay nothing too special. The one thing I did like was the crack pie! It's supposed to be served cold, but I recommend getting it down to room temperature and enjoying it that way. You can't really heat it up because it's a custard pie. Overall, service was good, but wouldn't really go back for their cookies. I would for their crack pie.",neutral,restaurant
175764,"True Rating: 3.5 Sweet and Savory My friends have hyped up this place for a while now, so I decided to check this place out the past MDW. I ordered the cereal milk ice cream with corn flakes and hot fudge. The ice cream base in my opinion was just ok. I am usually into creamy ice creams, but this my friends was not. However, I did enjoy the toppings. The corn flakes were sprinkled with salt and super crunchy as for the hot fudge it was not too overwhelming and loved the fact that they used dark chocolate. Final Verdict: It's okay.",neutral,restaurant
175767,"I am giving my experience a five star and the actual food I had a three. I ordered the pie because it was very popular in reviews unfortunately it was so sweet that I could only take a few bites before I recognized I needed to not eat anymore. The birthday cake was twice as expensive, totally recognizing we are in Las Vegas and things are going to be expensive but nearly $15 for a slice of cake is a little extreme. The staff was nice and on my next visit maybe I will try the ice cream. But the pie was way too sweet for me.",neutral,restaurant
175780,"It's soft serve, and there's a limited amount of flavors; however, the flavors they did have were delicious! It was extremely pricey for what we got and the toppings were a lot extra. This review is more for the value, because even though the taste was unique, regular soft serve flavors would honestly be very similar with the added toppings. Also it's impossible to walk outside in Vegas in the summer with this because it melts in like 2 seconds as expected, but just kind of a bummer because it's extra melt-y being soft serve vs the real deal ice cream.",neutral,restaurant
175785,"You're at Momofuku and they serve Milk Bar for you. WHY NOT? Milk Bar is ""one of the most exciting bakeries in the country"" by bon appÃ©tit magazine. Okay, since they say it like that, it's a sin if I don't right? We ordered the Milk Cereal with crunch and the Birthday Cake ice cream. Milk Cereal: 3/5 Milk Cereal WITH crunch: 3.5/5 Birthday Cake: 4/5 I'm into that sweet life and the Milk Cereal was definitely not sweet enough for me. However, the crunch was a great addition because of the sweet and savory taste. For my preference, I enjoyed the Birthday Cake more because it was sweeter. Even though I enjoyed it more, I actually thought it was too sweet. If there was a sweetness level in between the two it would be the winner. I enjoyed them, but it was just alright. Yes, it was tasty, but I had higher expectations. Creamy but not creamy enough. I feel so bad for giving it such a low rating, but perhaps the cookie route is the safer route. We'll see how it compares when I visit the NYC location.",neutral,restaurant
175787,"If you enjoy milk and cereal from Afters in California, you'll enjoy this place as well. They have their own version with cornflakes on top of milk ice cream and it's a really nice treat to have while in Vegas! What I liked was that the ice cream wasn't too sweet, and the saltiness of the cornflakes went well with it. I tried all their cookies (besides the confetti) and my final verdict is that the BLUEBERRY AND CREME is THE BEST ONE. The others tasted just like regular chocolate chip cookies to me. Blueberry and creme really stood out! Also perfect balance of sweetness. Really does tastes like a blueberry milk ice cream. If I ever visit Milk in Vegas again, it'll most likely be for the cookie.",neutral,restaurant
175794,"First and foremost, the staff was very friendly and accommodating at Milk Bar. Overall the store has cool and colorful decor with a modern appeal. I expected to pay more than the usual since this place is on the strip and located in a very popular resort and casino. I decided on getting the, Greatest Combo. Which was a good idea since it was my first time and wanted to try a bit of everything. The combo included a slice of crack pie, cookie, birthday cake truffles (3 pieces) and soft serve ice cream cone w/cornflake pieces. Crack Pie- Clever name, was ok and it was a bit bland in flavor. Cookie- This was my favorite of the items, consistent, chewy and full of flavor. I got the compost cookie. Will have to go back and try the other flavors of cookies Birthday Cake Truffles- Looks pretty but overall it was good and a little on the sweeter side. Soft Serve- I was expecting more of a creamy and tasty flavor but it more of like, ""I could've gone to DQ, reaction."" I wouldn't waste my time just to grab something sweet in the future. However, if I'm ever in the area with family and friends visiting is probably the only time I would come back or if I'm at one of the many restaurants or events at Cosmo. FYI: This place has no tables or chairs, it's more of a grab and go. There is lounge area that is part of the popular chandelier bar across the way that has decent amount of sofas and side tables. 2017 Yelp Review #10",neutral,restaurant
175795,"Milk Bar.. Its located in the Cosmpolitan.. They have different choices of ice-cream that you can choose.. But I got the cereal milk soft serve ice-cream, and I think it's too sweet and also overpriced of the amount of what you're paying for just to eat this. ... And also this was hyped up..however, I don't regret eating this, but this willbe the first and last time that I will eat that cereal ice-cream.",neutral,restaurant
175803,Cookies were on the sweeter side. Compost cookies was yummy and a good mix of sweet & savory but too heavy for my taste. I also tried the corn cookies. It's like cornflake cookies. Tasted much better than the compost cookie. I ordered a small size soft serve. Tasted like cereal milk with cornflake topping. It's yummy if you like drinking your cereal milk after eating all the cereals.,neutral,restaurant
175811,"Crack Pie. After watching Chef's Table I was obsessed with trying this Crack pie. In the documentary they had Matt Lauer saying it really was like crack and he needed more. So I finally get to the one at Cosmo in Vegas and order a piece. It's $6.50 and smaller than a McDonald's apple pie. Maybe the size of a McDonald's apple pie with a bite taken out of it. From what I've been told it's supposed to be gooey toward the center (center? At that size there's really no center!), smooth and silky. Instead I paid for a dense, chewy piece that more resembled a cliff energy bar. The flavor was good and very sugary but nothing close to what was billed in the documentary. I was really, really bummed. You see, I gave up crack a few years ago and was looking for a replacement. This ain't it. I'm wondering now if it wasn't sitting in their cooler too long and I just got a stale piece. Nonetheless I would expect more from a place like this. I was going to get a slice of Birthday Cake for my granddaughter but at $14 a slice I didn't want further disappointment and possibly become suicidal. In my opinion Crack pie is not all it's cracked up to be. I may be giving it another try in the future though. You know how junkies are.",neutral,restaurant
175820,"We ordered compost cookies and milk ice cream for our after dinner deserts one night. The verdict was ordinary tasting cookies and ice cream, not worth the high prices. Basically we paid for bragging and photos of the famous Milk Bar visit. I supposed the high rent of locating the store inside The Cosmopolitan justified the high prices. One visit was enough.",neutral,restaurant
175845,"Haven't been to the original location in NYC but decided to come here since I've been wanting to try it. My bf & I shared the milk and cereal flavored soft serve. It was super creamy and I also added the corn flakes topping as well. Overall, the ice cream was good, but definitely not good enough to warrant the price. For one small soft serve I paid almost $8!!! The corn flakes topping itself was an extra $1.50 & they didn't even give that much. It was pretty much just fried corn flake crumbles. I would prefer milk & cereal flavored ice cream from afters back home instead of this one, although this one wasn't necessarily bad, it was just way overpriced and not that great.",neutral,restaurant
175869,"Before any Vegas trip, I find it necessary to look to Yelp for any new, must-try foods or desserts that have arrived in Vegas. This most recent trip, Milk seemed like a must-try given that they only have three other locations (NYC, DC, and Toronto). The shop has a small footprint in the Cosmopolitan where real estate must be extremely pricey and for that reason, it's mostly a buy and go, but there's plenty of seating nearby. The menu has lots of options but breaks down pretty simple to cookies, klossies, which are also cookies, cake truffles, cakes and pies, soft serves and shakes, and lastly, buns and breads. If you look on Yelp or Instagram, the go-to is the cereal milk soft serve, which when you break it down is a vanilla soft serve and garnished with corn flakes. It's funny how something so simple can be so tasty and grow a following. If you're visiting from out of town, I suggest going with this menu staple. If you're a coffee lover, you cannot leave without trying their cereal milk affogato, which was made with their vanilla soft serve and topped off with a double espresso shot. Again, simple in its own right, but oh so tasty. If there's anything I could of changed, I would of asked if they could of added corn flakes on to the affogato. If you're with a big party, there are more items on the menu that can be shared such as the infamous Crack Pie or their cookies, but if your by yourself or with your significant other, you can't go wrong with their cereal milk soft serve. Note: Located on the second floor near Eggslut. Ambiance/Decor: N/A Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Price: $ Overall: 3/5 Pros: + Simple and straight forward dessert menu + Tasty soft serve concoctions + Delicious affogato + Grab and go storefront + Late hours Cons: - Staff could have been a little more friendly - A bit on the pricey side; $7 for cereal soft serve; and a reasonable $5 for the affogato",neutral,restaurant
175871,"This place is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel right next to Momofuku. My friend told me about this place and I thought I'd give this a try to see what the hype was all about. This place constantly had a line but the workers move pretty quick. Being my first time here, I referred to yelp to help me decide on what Soft serve/dessert I wanted to try and it seemed like their cereal milk soft serve($6) with Frosted Flakes add-on ($1.50)seems the most popular, so I thought I'd give that a try. The soft serve wasn't the best I've had, but it definitely wasn't the worst. I expected a lot more from the soft serve but it just tasted like milk with salty Frosted Flakes.

175901,"WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE SWEET CRAVINGS (Warning: Young adult from Central Florida in for vacation) The Cookies, Crack Pie, and Coffee all fell to my cravings- sadly since these snacks were just to top off a meal, I had no room for the (very cool and crazy looking) Milkshakes... which can be made boozy! COMPOST COOKIES- NAME SAYS IT ALL ... and I also took a Cornflake Cookie. With ingredients like Coffee, Potato Chips, or Cornflakes, the end result was actually more like a 'more complicated' Chocolate Chip Cookie. I barely (if at all) tasted those weird ingredients individually so it was a bit of a miss. The best part were the bursts of salt from the Pretzels or Cornflakes. I also enjoyed the changed texture, ore similar to a soft (but not gooey) Oatmeal Cookie. IT IS ALL IT'S 'CRACKED' UP TO BE? The Crack Pie was a decent dessert. I liked the butterscotch flavor a lot- something I don't see in many pies. But the hard texture and strange way of serving it (packaging it in a cardboard, roundish box) were curiosities. Overall, this place is a bit pricey... but I also know you're paying for Strip resort prices. Keep in mind there's no seating here- just a walk up counter.",neutral,restaurant

175933,"I was really looking forward to trying Milk Bar, but to my dismay, it really wasn't that great. It's not even that the prices are ridiculous or anything; the sweets just didn't live up to the hype. When we went around 1:30pm on a Sunday, there was about 10 people in line and it didn't take too long to get to the counter. They ran out of a few of the popular cookies so we ended up getting the crack pie, corn cookie, blueberry and cream cookie, birthday cake truffles, and the cereal milk soft serve with cornflake crunch. The crack pie was way too sweet for my taste, though I enjoyed the consistency of the pie.. The blueberry and cream cookie was kind of oily, and the corn cookie was pretty good. I only had a bite of the soft serve because I was so full, but my first impression was slight disappointment and that I've had better. So all in all, I may have expected too much, but it was simply a mediocre experience.",neutral,restaurant
175982,"As part of the Momofuku experience, it would be hard pressed not to stop and try some goodies from Milk! However, because I'm lactose intolerant and didn't bring any lactaid with me when I went, I have to give a review on the cookies only. First, the staff work as quickly as possible, but since they're basically a stand next to Momofuku in the Cosmopolitan, people can be rude and cut right in front of you! (Which they do!) Only so much the staff can do about these people lol. They're all really nice people though! (As are most servers in Vegas) I got three cookies, which is one of the deals. Cookies are $3 each or 3/$8. Blueberry and cream, compost cookie, and the chocolate chocolate cookie. All of these cookies were a bit dry and not really that great or even memorable. The blueberry and cream tasted like it had sour cream in it. It was weird and I wasn't too much of a fan, that I didn't even finish it. The compost cookie wasn't *bad* but it wasn't that great either. It was a little salty, a little sweet, and pretty much forgetabble. Also crumbly and did I mention dry? Finally, the chocolate chocolate, which lives up to its name. It's super rich and pretty satisfying, but again, nothing special. So for cookies, I think because they're prepackaged and not freshly made, I would just skip it. I want to come back and try some of their other goodies though like their stuffed bagels or their ice cream!",neutral,restaurant

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and there was no line. The girls working were super sweet. They gave me complimentary birthday truffles when my boyfriend told them it was my birthday. The birthday truffles were a bit too sweet for my liking but my boyfriend absolutely loves it. He ordered the compost cookie which I highly do not recommend. Flavors were lacking and cookie isn't too soft. I ordered the cereal milk soft serve with cornflake crumble, one of their popular items I was told. It tasted exactly like its name - cereal and milk lol. While decent, it isn't worth $7 and probably is something I wouldn't go out of my way to get in Vegas.",neutral,restaurant
176014,"I was so excited to go to Milk from all of the pictures i see on social media. I got 3 things at Milk. First since I am a cake lover I got a slice of Birthday Cake which is a vanilla rainbow cake, rainbow cake crumbs, sprinkles, vanilla frosting. The cake was moist and and the frosting did have a big vanilla taste but as far as cakes go it was a little underwhelming. Really nothing special with that slice of cake. The second thing I ordered was the Crunchy Cereal Shake which was made with milk, cornflakes, brown sugar and a pinch of salt. It did taste like cereal like I expected but all I really did was pay $9 to drink cereal, nothing special there either. The last thing I ordered which was the best thing was the Crack Pie. I can see why this is there fan favorite because it is addicting as if you were doing crack. Haha. The Crack Pie has a toasted oat crust and a gooey butter filling. So you get that crunch of the crust with that creamy gooey filling. This is the one thing you must have at Milk, but overall this place was pricey and not as exciting as it has been made out to be.

176015,Food: only tried the dessert items: assortment of cookies and crack pie. Have made several of the cookies from the cookbook. Not impressed. All of this might be better if if was freshly baked. Like my own versions better. Service: it was a walk up counter. Atmospher: it was a walk up counter. Visited on 2.24.18,neutral,restaurant
176027,"This place is so stinking cute it's a small spot and I decided to get a soft serve which is what there know for, and it was good I would say it literally tasted like left over milk from the bottom of fruity pebbles or Frosted Flakes, but frozen and I made a mistake on getting chocolate chips with it definitely would recommend the cereal crunch instead it pairs way better. It was pricey though for two soft serves it was $14 so about $7 each ice cream with out the cone. It was good but not that good maybe if it was cheaper I would consider getting ice cream again but I'm not much of a cereal person to begin with so I might have to pass.",neutral,restaurant
176029,"I love white russians so I had to get the cereal milk white russian milkshake--bad choice! It made me sick to my stomach, it tasted so gross. I ate some of my friends' soft serve (different ones got the different flavors) and they were all good and made up for the bad milkshake.",neutral,restaurant
176034,"Was super excited to try out Milk Bar after watching Christina Tosi's episode of Chef's Table and knew I had to stop by. We ordered a slice of crack pie and a cereal milk soft serve as a post-lunch dessert. As many others have said, everything here is expensive and in my opinion, not worth the high price-tag. The cereal milk soft serve tasted nice, wasn't too sweet, and had a lighter texture than many soft serves I've tried before but I felt that there really wasn't anything special or memorable about it- at least not enough to warrant $6 (& this is without the cereal flakes on top). Now moving on to the crack pie, I was pretty shocked with the size, this thing is SMALL. My boyfriend is honestly still appalled that we paid over $6 for this but I personally think it's a better deal than the soft serve. Yes it's small but it is really dense and filling. It has a beautiful buttery and sugary taste that I really enjoyed - I'd probably bump my rating up to 4 stars if the price of this dropped to about $4 or $5 to be honest. Overall I think Milk Bar is the type of place you visit just to say you've visited. The prices are simply too high- even if it does taste pretty good. I would only be back if I was SUPER craving crack pie or if I won a nice little jackpot downstairs (then I'd buy the entire crack pie for ~$50)",neutral,restaurant
176036,"Three stars - Milk Bar was just ""A - OKAY."" I was super amped to try this place upon viewing photos of the ever popular Milk Bar on Instagram. However, the taste did not make up for the hype or all the visually appealing photos. I tried the crack pie, cereal milk soft serve and three cookies. Crack Pie - My friend made this once with a recipe she found online and it was ah-ma-zinnnnnng! Surely I thought the original must taste 10x better. Unfortunately, it was a total let down -- nothing too spectacular about it. It was essentially like I was eating a really sweet piece of butter. Cereal Milk Soft Serve - This literally just tasted like milk. If you enjoy the aftertaste of milk in your mouth, this this might be for you. I didn't enjoy this overall. But that's just my opinion. Cookies (3 for $8) - I tried the Blueberry & Cream, Compost and the Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow. I enjoyed them most in the order listed. The texture of the cookie was a weird hard chewiness? The blueberry & cream was quite tasty, so I would probably get that again if I were to return.",neutral,restaurant
176081,"UPDATED: In regards of my review, the manager reached out to me and was extremely polite and considerate causing me to raise my star review. I will be giving this place another try because of his kind words & customer service skills. Milk bar was extremely mediocre. The regular vanilla soft serve was disgusting. The chocolate pretzel soft serve was wayyyyy to salty. The crack pie soft serve is by far the best out of all of them. The crack pie is good, but way over rated, I've had much better. The birthday cake shakes had to be the best thing our party got. The girls at the register were nice & polite, but you could tell they were trying to rush through the line because it was slightly busy. Overall it seemed extremely over priced & definitely not good. We will not be returning.",neutral,restaurant
176093,"Heard the rave about their shakes so had to give it a try. I've only tried the Crack Pie Milk, a slice of crack pie blended into cereal milk, soft serve. It wasn't anything spectacular. It was a bit too sweet for my liking, but to be fair I don't have a super love for overly sweet things. For the price and flavor I most likely wouldn't order again. Maybe next time I'd order something else to give this place a fair shot.",neutral,restaurant
176147,Just okay. We had some kind of cereal ice cream. Humphry slocomb is better!,neutral,restaurant
176155,"I visited Milk Bar twice during my recent stay in Vegas. The first time I got a fantastic Boozy Coffee milkshake. The guy making the drinks was informative, patient with EVERYONE in line asking ""what's cereal milk"" ** and he made sure it was done right. The result was a fabulous, just the right thickness, not too boozy, just the right coffee essence masterpiece. The second time I went no one seemed to know how to make the SAME milkshake I ordered before and it was dismal. Way too thin this time with no balance of flavors and really not at all worth the $12 price tag. We ordered two and they came out different, neither of them like the fantastic one I had the day before. Bad execution issues.",neutral,restaurant
176156,"Milk Bar is definitely one of the most unique ice cream/dessert shops I've been to. Their class cereal milk ice cream with cornflakes threw me off. I was expecting a sweet, creamy flavor but was struck with slight sweetness overpowered by salt from the cornflakes. The ice cream takes a more salty approach than sweet. I also tried their compose cookie - one of a kind taste made with unconventional ingredients. Definitely worth a try. 3 stars because my taste buds say no but obviously Milk Bar has a huge fan base from all the 5 star reviews.",neutral,restaurant
176172,"The dessert bar looks cool and are operated by nice people. They have baskets of cookies arranged in the front and a chalkboard menu. Only ordered the most recommended dessert, the birthday cake, since I make it a habit now to try the best thing before buying a lot of things (especially at $16/ slice with tax). Not a huge fan of the cake. The portion was substantial but the cake was dry and the frosting was plain. A friend complained it was too sweet. I'd have rather bought the pillsbury funfetti cake mix and made it myself for much cheaper and same taste. Don't waste money here for any hype, it's not worth the price or the calories.",neutral,restaurant
176190,"Crack pie was very good, but so rich--plan to share the slice with someone. Compost cookie was not a hit with us--very strong coffee taste, which we did not care for. Overall decent, but not likely to go out of my way to visit.",neutral,restaurant
176197,"It's a great concept. The menu is creative and fun, and the product is tasty, although very sweet - and this is coming from an American. Beware of massive sugar highs and even bigger crashes lol! Firstly, Ingrid (I believe), has great customer service skills. She easily sold us on her favorite menu items, and was willing to answer my partner's many questions. She definitely had fun with us, and vice versa. She sold us on quite a bit of treats, and since we are locals, we don't mind taking stuff home. A box of a dozen cookies and a Crack Pie - because who doesn't get the Crack Pie? She had a lot of great ideas for enjoying the cookies. The Corn Sugar cookie warmed with honey? Yes, please! Now, my only complaint is the price point. I completely understand Strip prices, considering I live in Vegas and have worked on the Strip for years. However, $35 for a dozen average-sized cookies? That alone will ensure that I don't go back on a regular basis, even though I'm in the area quite often. It'll be a nice treat when friends or family come to town, maybe. But it's not going to generate any return business from myself, or many locals, really. It's too bad, because everything else was on point.",neutral,restaurant
176218,Pretty delicious. Cereal milk flavored ice cream wasn't super sweet which was a nice change and the cereal was a bit salty. Nice combo. It was a bit expensive but IT IS VEGAS AFTER ALL!,neutral,restaurant
176239,I wanted to be wowed and just wasn't. Well the bagel bomb was good it was way over priced for what you got. We also a slice of crack pie and was shocked at how small it was for $6.50. All food seems overpriced in Vegas I was just hoping for more. The hot chocolate was good but nothing special. Maybe cake is where it is but we will never know. Also we went in the morning and cashier was either high or hung over but she wasn't on this planet.,neutral,restaurant
176280,Went here for a 1am milkshake and it was just alright - there aren't a great many options and the cereal milk crunchy shake that I got was pretty delicious but the quantity was pretty small and I felt that there was way too much cereal left behind in the cup that I couldn't finish and had to throw away. (Maybe use a spoon the next time? ) if I want a milkshake next time I'd prolly just go to shake shack.,neutral,restaurant
176302,"Expensive and over rated. The crack pie is good, but not the best thing I ever ate. The bday cake milk quake was just OK. The ice cream texture wasn't my fave - too melty. I guess it didn't meet my expectations.",neutral,restaurant
176334,"Give their cereal milk soft serve a try. It's pretty interesting. Texture is creamy and taste exactly like cereal. A great spot in cosmo if you are looking for some quick desserts like cookies, milk shakes and ice cream. Bare in mind they do not have any seating and it's to go only.",neutral,restaurant
176386,What's so great about the soft serve? It doesn't doesn't like anything . The corn flakes taste like salty butter and the (milk cereal) soft serve doesn't take like anything. I was expecting something like milk & cereal from Afters in Long Beach. Stars for customer service though! I asked for birthday candles for the cake truffles (it's my husband's birthday) I purchased and the cashier handed me some! Thank you :),neutral,restaurant
176387,"I wanted to try out the cereal milk soft serve because of all the hype. I sampled the crack pie soft serve (too sweet!) and the cereal milk soft serve and preferred the cereal milk. I got the smallest size but after eating about half, the novelty of the cereal milk flavor wore off. I think this location also lends itself to an uncomfortable treat-eating experience (e.g., feels weird to eat soft serve when there is club music blaring and club people drinking around you).",neutral,restaurant
176389,Tried crack pie and most cookie flavors. Pie wasn't what I expected and tasted just ok.... very rich dense butter solid filling ...don't eat the entire slice in one sitting...can't believe the astronomical cost for a whole pie...over 50+... cookies were meh......liked the corn one best,neutral,restaurant
176393,"I got the chocolate chocolate cookie and it was too bitter and ""healthy cookie"" tasting. I get dark chocolate can be a bit bitter but this was too much, and if I want a healthy cookie I'd make it myself. Hubby got the crunch cereal shake which he said he like a lot.",neutral,restaurant
176402,"Somewhat over hyped for me. I enjoyed the cookies, especially the corn and compost cookies. I liked the crack pie, but it was too expensive for the little pie. Also it doesn't seem that they are freshly made their, it seems like they are just straight shipped from New York.",neutral,restaurant
176415,I really was looking forward to trying this place but honestly it wasn't all that...I have to say the customer service here is BOMB! I ordered a cake a week in advance and they were very accommodating. The birthday cake was delicious but the cereal milk soft serve with cornflakes was not good. Was hoping it would be sweeter and less bland.,neutral,restaurant
176420,5 stars for the cookies and 0 for the cereal milk which tasted like expired ass milk. Would return for the cookies and maybe a milkshake,neutral,restaurant
176463,"I read the reviews here before trying Milk Bar and thought they seemed particularly harsh. I generally love trying places like this, I love sweets of all types and I'm not too picky about them. But after trying Milk Bar I have to say for the most part I agree with the lukewarm reviews. First let me just say that the flavors this place serves up are unique and dare I say jarring. They don't quite taste like anything i've had before, for better or for worse. Corn Cookie - Their cookies are very dense and hard without being crunchy if that makes sense. They're a bit too dense for my taste. My favorite of the cookies was the corn cookie. I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, I had to get used to the unique taste. I didn't love it, but it was good and interesting. Blueberry & Cream Cookie - Not as yummy as it sounds, I think this was my least favorite of all three cookies. Compost Cookie - Not impressed by this either. This one was the most dense and hard and had an overpowering taste of coffee. Birthday Cake Truffles - I love anything bday cake flavored, so I had to try these. These would be great if you are majorly craving something super sweet, but like others said, it is a bit too sweet and just tastes like an undercooked sugar cookie. Not bad, but not particularly good. White Russian Milk Quake - Again, jarring and unique flavor. This is a milkshake made out of their cereal milk spiked with kahlua I think. It was the cereal taste that caught me off gaurd the most. Overall, I enjoyed this the most out of all the items I tried and would definitely try another one of their spiked milkquakes. Most spiked milkshakes you get on the strip seem to have zero alcohol in them but this one, I could really taste the alcohol (in a good way). I'm sad I didn't get to try the crackpie. Next time I'll be sure to grab one of those and maybe the soft serve. Oh, also the service left something to be desired. But overall, I think this place is worth a try.",neutral,restaurant
176488,"Good, but overpriced for what it was. They give huge servings tho, so you can easily split it with a friend.",neutral,restaurant
176498,"After dinner at Momofuku, we stopped by Milk Bar for dessert. They also serve most of the items at Momofuku, but we wanted to stretch out the experience. After trying samples of the Cereal Milk and Crack Pie soft serve, I hastily made the decision to go with the Crack Pie soft serve ($6) as it was more flavorful at the moment. I quickly regretted my decision as it got heavy very quickly (as I was still finishing my samples after paying). I +$0.50 for sprinkles. Should've gone with Cereal Milk. Very disappointed as they yelled out my order to find my soft serve in a non-distinct clear cup instead of their famous MILK cup. Also, they did not roll the sprinkles onto the side as they do with the corn flakes (+$1) like I saw in the pictures (WHY!). I wanted the full Milk Bar experience, but feel like I only got half. Noteworthy mention was definitely the sprinkles. Conflicted if I should return or not..",neutral,restaurant
176524,"Since this was probably our only opportunity to try the famous Milk Bar, we decided to go for the tasting. The cake pop was incredibly sweet (as I think most are), The soft serve with corn flakes was good, the cookie was just ok, and the crack pie was very good. Probably wouldn't return to spend that much unless it was for the pie.",neutral,restaurant
176576,"Okay, so I may be reprimanded for this rating! I don't get how this is good 'custard'. If custard stands for froyo-ish ice cream then yes it's good. Good texture, stays cold, no overpowering flavour and just yhe right amounts of sugar. And the lemon one is the best flavour. But, IMHO, this is not custard.",neutral,restaurant
176666,"Sure, it tastes all right, but this place is nothing to get worked up over. Especially considering the price. After I went I wished I just picked up a pint of Ben and Jerry's instead (not custard, I know...) The menu might give you a seizure, too. Trust me I am an expert on frozen desserts.",neutral,restaurant
176723,"It's frozen custard, not yogurt or ice cream. I'm probably not a fan of custard. But definitely worth a try because its the most famous dessert place in town!",neutral,restaurant
176784,"First of all, Jarling's custard cup is NOT custard. I assume it used to be custard at one time. It isn't anymore, but they've retained their name. The website clearly states that they serve ""Ice Milk"". ""Our Product is Ice Milk. It has 30% less butterfat and cholesterol than traditional iced cream and contains no eggs."" Try to make custard without eggs. Oh wait, you can't because eggs are one of the defining ingredients! If you have had real custard before, then just go to Jarling's knowing it's NOT custard, and it'll be okay. I went thinking it was custard and was disappointed. It all made sense when I found out the truth. I highly recommend the lemon flavor. We're used to lemon tasting artificial. Lemon meringue pie, lemon bars, lemonade, etc. all taste artificially sweet and like, well, lemon flavoring. That's why lemon tastes the best at Jarling's. You are used to and expect the artificial taste. The other flavors taste artificial (because the ingredients are), but they're not satisfying. Personally, I prefer natural strawberry flavor over artificial strawberry syrup. This applies to almost every flavor, except lemon! The waffle cones are generally good. The best part of going here is watching the employees create snowstorms and sundaes. You can see that they are using a freshly opened Snickers candy bar in your treat rather than scooping sitting pieces out of a bucket. TIP: If you don't want to wait in line, go on a rainy day!",neutral,restaurant
176806,"I really like the atmosphere here. Even though I'm not from around here, its the sort of place I can feel right at home in. And its fun to people-watch everyone enjoying their cold treats on a hot summer day. And if you grow tired of the crowd, its across the street from Hessel Park, where you can find a spot out on the grass. The frozen custard itself? Nothing out of the ordinary. I mean, of course its good, its cold, creamy and sweet. But so is the ice cream from anywhere else.",neutral,restaurant
176815,It's a mom & pop ice cream place. What's not to like? They recently starting taking credit cards so I like them even more now ;-),neutral,restaurant
176821,I think this place is a little overrated. I honestly don't think it is as good as some described it to be. My custard was a little too soft and not creamy at all. I would rather have Culvers.,neutral,restaurant
176835,I might be a little biased because Jarlings comes nowhere near close to my favorite frozen custard place in Chicago (Scooters!). It still satisfies the sweet tooth and they have a pretty good variety. I've just had better frozen custard (at other locations besides my favorite).,neutral,restaurant
176900,"My daughter and I were craving for ice cream and saw this place in Yelp. We were excited for Somisomi as it was our first time here. We walked in and it smelled so good! The fragrance of the waffles filled the room and so we decided to get the 5 pc Nutella filled Taiyaki. After further examination of the menu, we also opt for the soft serve - ube and matcha. Everything was delicious. The gentleman who prepared our food was great! He was polite and helpful. The girl at the register however came off as rude and impatient. We had questions about the menu and it was obvious it was our first time here but she had this attitude like oh you don't know?! We will try this place again and hopefully we don't get that girl. She was the reason why our first experience at this establishment was not great. Our excitement slightly fizzled after we encountered her.",neutral,restaurant

177099,"My girlfriend and I went there a few weeks ago because it was a catchy name, it was close, and the pictures were interesting. However, I was quickly apprehensive when I ordered a very simple ( one scoop vanilla one scoop strawberry in a cup) order and the employee seemed like he didn't know where to start. He made it vastly more complicated than it had to be and it was so tiny I think a child would have been distraught. I didn't say anything because I didn't mind and told him to get my girlfriend whatever she wanted. She ordered one of the snow cones that they have featured on the sign. It had three ingredients excluding ice. He had to look back at the sign numerous times, he clearly had no idea what went into the dish, and to top it off she said she could barely taste the flavors and basically had a five dollar bowl of shaved ice. They're a little pricy for what you get and they were out of nearly all the flavors we either wanted or wanted to try. I felt bad for my friend because she agreed to go because online it says they offer frozen yogurt. Well, Inside, they don't. She can't have ice cream. I will say the inside is esthetically pleasing and could be a cool little unique place If they were accurate with their menu, knew the menu, and had the ability to make the dishes that they offer. Better luck next time I suppose.",neutral,restaurant
177168,We were referred here by friends who rave about this place. Maybe our expectations were too high because I think you can do better in the ice cream aisle of the grocery store for less than our $14 bill was here. The ice cream was fine. The chocolate wasn't rich or very flavorful. The peanut butter ice cream was nutty and not too sweet. That was good. I was told to get the hot fudge which I ordered but didn't end up on my sundae. My wife ordered a chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was baked well and had good texture but had more salt on top than I'd prefer. There's a good amount of parking and a nice outdoor seating area out back. Only one party of customers is allowed in the store at a time and all of the employees were wearing masks. Sanitizer was provided. All in you can feel okay passing on this one.,neutral,restaurant
177171,"Visited churn after looking at the reviews and wasn't disappointed. Tried the double scoop with one scoop of Vietnamese coffee and the other being butter pecan- both were amazing! Got whipped cream as a topping to add to the taste... Also tried the malted milk chocolate which was yummy but butter pecan won over for me. The Vietnamese coffee was the top favorite flavor for me and my husband. The only reason I'm giving less stars here is because when I checked their online menu they had so many amazing and out of the box flavors showing up which I was really looking forward to try but they barely had 6-8 ice cream flavors to choose from at the store - whatever flavor I tried were without a doubt amazing for sure! Also, I thought my husband and I wouldn't be able to finish the double scoop portion at once (which we ended up finishing) so I asked for a lid for the cup and they had only a flat top cup not a dome shaped one which wasn't cool.",neutral,restaurant
177230,"I wasn't feelin this place quite honestly. It's a little hole in the wall and the employees were more than nice. The ice cream just didn't really set itself apart in anyway if I'm being honest and I know the 4 other adults with me felt same way. Nonetheless, Aaron Goldsmith was in front of us with his family and that was definitely the highlight",neutral,restaurant
177234,"Churn is a cute little ice cream parlor located near a bunch of restaurants on Central Ave north of downtown Phoenix. My friend and I got a scoop each on a sugar cone. To be honest, I wanted to like this place more because of the good reviews. However, I was quite disappointed about the small number of flavors to choose from, and they didn't sound that great either. Maybe it was just the night that we went. It was an ok first experience here, but I'd be willing to give it another chance and check out if they've switched the flavors around. Churn shares a space with the restaurant Windsor. They share a parking lot but it is quite small, so it can be challenging during busy times. I recommend checking out the parking on the right side instead of in front of Churn, if parking there is full.",neutral,restaurant
177235,"This ice cream place is a cute store! Has so many toys and interesting things. I like the interior design in the store. The Vietnamese coffee tastes pretty good. But I ended up getting the strawberry ice cream. Their ice cream is really creamy and soft. Also, their scoops are so big! I couldn't finish one by myself. They had extra seating outside in the back with the water misters going on so that was nice. I was scared I was going to eat my ice cream in the heat because there is no inside seating. Only one thing I didn't like is how the ice cream was melting really quick. Its probably from the combination of the door being kept open and people were really crowded in that store. I also don't see why people like this place so much. It's okay. Nothing special to it just regular ice cream but I just went to try to say that I have gone there before.",neutral,restaurant
177283,I had seen Churn on multiple lists of places to try in and around Phoenix so I made sure to squeeze in a visit. I made my group drive all the way across the city for what promised to be the best ice cream. Even though it was a cold evening the place had a line. After having some difficulty deciding what to get I went with a straight forward ice cream cone. I don't know if my expectations were set too high but I thought it was good. It nothing spectacular. I think the chocolate chip cookie I got for the next day was way better than the ice cream.,neutral,restaurant
177300,This place is WAYY too busy and the ice cream isn't worth the wait. There was a long line inside on a colder night in phoenix and the staff made everyone move outside and wait in the cold. Their store is extremely tiny and overcrowded. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the MANY other places to get ice cream in phoenix. There is NO seating inside their store which is ridiculous and seating is limited outside sharing tables with other neighboring restaurants. Just not worth the long lines and no seating battling the crowd.,neutral,restaurant
177371,"Let's get this straight first: this place is super cute and the employees were very friendly. It's got an old school parlor vibe and other nostalgic candy and toys available for purchase. The vibe is pretty nice. The ice cream is decent. They had some unique flavors along with some classics, and they have toppings etc you can add on. They also have a pretzel cone for those who may be into that. There isn't any indoor seating, as this place is connected to the restaurant next door. There are some tables outside out the back though. Logistically it can be a little crazy since they have people working the restaurant in and out of the back areas. As for the ice cream, it's okay. I had half a scoop of dark chocolate and half a scoop of peanut butter. Pretty cool that they do half scoops. The peanut butter was good, the chocolate was basic. My girlfriend ordered the s'mores sundae and it was HUGE. Toasted marshmallow, lots of hot fudge, graham cracker and ice cream. The hot fudge did have the ice cream melt quickly, so it was hard to eat l more than a few bites before it turned pretty soupy. Looked great though. Overall it's cute but I'm not sure I would come running back for the ice cream.",neutral,restaurant
177521,"Great ice cream! I don't know why, but it was so hard to find good ice cream places around here.. Parking was limited in their immediate private lot, but to the right is a larger parking lot available for the neighboring restaurants. (Postino Central is right across the street!) When you enter the store, it's like going back to your childhood because all the candies you grew up with are there! They have about 20 flavors of hand made ice cream. My favorite was the cookie & mint. I loved the cookie pieces in the ice cream! I tried their seasonal Whiskey Toffee and Peach & Honey, but I didn't like either one of those.. The flavors are definitely there, but I wanted something more refreshing like mint. I'd go back for that mint ice cream again! What's cool about Churn is their pretzel cone. For 2 scoops and a pretzel cone, it was about $4.50. The scoops were average/good size. The pretzel cone was ok; I would prefer a waffle cone because it's sweeter. The pretzel was too salty; it made me more thirsty than I already was in the heat! I personally wouldn't recommend the pretzel, but I would come back for the ice cream if I were in the area!",neutral,restaurant
177558,"Churn offers plenty of menu options that all sound amazing. All the ice cream samples I tried were delicious but the flavors didn't particularly stand out to me the day I went. I ordered a cookie and ice cream sandwich and it was a bit much, I should've just ordered a single scoop, which was still huge. A bit pricey but I think it's worth splurging for some delicious ice cream with huge portions, maybe worth sharing with someone else though.",neutral,restaurant
177611,"The staff was friendly, but I wasn't a fan of their malt shake. It was very watery. I had them make it with one scoop of chocolate and one scoop of peanut butter ice cream and the flavor was good, but it tasted more like I was drinking chocolate peanut butter milk.",neutral,restaurant

177881,"Delicious, but for the price I felt like I should have gotten more ice cream. They were cheap with the scoops and the sauce. The butter pecan with salted caramel was delicious. Just wish I had gotten more of it considering what I paid.",neutral,restaurant
177973,"The entry way of the shop is lined with shelves of nostalgic candy novelties and trinkets, the walls have cutesy hipster artwork, and the back is connected to a restaurant and opens up to a patio with seating. From what I remember, I kept thinking these desserts were rather expensive. I believe a small float was $5.25. That's nearly $6 for a float! However, the treats I sampled were quite tasty. The S'mores Sundae ($6.25) had two scoops of rich, decadent chocolate ice cream, hot fudge, graham crackers, and torched marshmallow fluff - a good treat to share but way too much on your own. I also tried Peach & Honey ice cream in a pretzel cone - I felt as though the honey overpowered the peach flavor and the pretzel cone is a good idea in theory but was a little saltier than I expected. Overall, both were pretty good and perfect with someone with a major sweet tooth!",neutral,restaurant
177983,"Great vibe, but the service sucked. Sunday night and there was only 1 person behind me. It was my first visit and the young girl was obviously in a rush. I ended up with the salted Carmel freeze. The ice cream was melting and runny. I will give it a try again, but my first visit wasn't impressive.",neutral,restaurant
178054,"I had heard so much about Churn and was super excited to finally go here. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was kinda disappointed. Ice cream was good but nothing amazing. We were lucky and only had to wait for one person before we could order. But, as we stood waiting for our ice creams to be made, the place started filling up with customers coming in both the front and the back door. It was becoming a huge cluster with no clear front or back of the line and if I had walked into that mess I would have walked right back out.",neutral,restaurant
178172,Ice cream good. Service not so much. The young lady that served us this evening was much more interested in continuing her conversation with her co-worker than anything I had to say.,neutral,restaurant
178293,"Donut Kill My Vibe!! This is a cute, small and fun donut bar! It's been in my bookmarked list for the next time I came to Vegas, and I finally got to try them. When you walk in the aroma of fresh donuts hits you in the face. It's also super cute and colorful. I love that you could see all the donuts on display as well as the colors of the place. It's very warm and welcoming. The staff is also extremely nice and patient. I say patient because I was so eager to get inside and take pictures and create a video. Haha. However as far as taste, their donuts are pretty average. They have tons of donuts to choose from but we ended up getting the Big Poppa Tart Donut, Strawberry Filled Donut, and they gave us a free candy cane donut because we had our 14 month old daughter with us. How cool is that?! Very nice and thoughtful. I have never had a donut place offer a free kids donut. However, I will say their donuts are a little more on the expensive side, but most are bigger than your average donut so it balances out. The Big Poppa Tart was definitely big and enough to share. I got the Strawberry one. It's made to look like an oversized Pop-tart. The cool thing is, there is an entire pop tart on the inside of the Big Poppa Tart. The donut itself was very good and tender. It also tasted amazing with the strawberry jam on top. Now I will be honest and say I didn't care much for the Pop-tart on the inside. It was chewy and a little stale tasting as far as texture. It didn't taste like a regular Pop-Tart. I guess something changes as the donut is heated and fried. Overall, the Big Poppa Tart is pretty and the edges taste really good. My husband ate my entire half of my Big Poppa and he never said a thing about the Pop-Tart so I guess it didn't bother him. He just said he couldn't taste it. *Shrugs* I guess it's more of a personal preference. The Strawberry Filled tasted pretty good. I didn't get to taste it because my husband killed it but overall it was good he said. He said it honestly didn't taste like anything special or different than any other Strawberry Filled Donut he has had. I will say this is one of their smaller donuts. If you order a circular shaped donut then these are the bigger ones. I also didn't taste my daughter's donut but my husband did. He said it tasted like a regular donut. I guess she liked it because she ate it all. It was just a donut in the shape of a candy cane with white and red glaze on top. Overall, Donut Bar was cute and fun! As far as taste, I don't think they were anything special. They were pretty average. I will say their creativity of their donuts and some of the flavors is unique but other than that they taste just like any other donut shop.",neutral,restaurant
178308,"We heard about this place that claims to be the best donut in the world. Read the reviews and saw the stars and we knew we had to come and see their claim to fame. With that said we came around 10am and there was no line. That was nice since we could take our time and chat with the workers. They told us their claim to fame is the Big Poppa. It's a massive size donut that has a Pop Tart in the middle. So we said to throw one in the box along with creme brulee, birthday cake, chocolate bar (it's like a long John with cream inside), and a couple of others. We were excited to dig in as everything looked good. Now this is where the song lyrics came to my head ""don't believe the hype!"". We cut the Big Poppa and took a bite and we both thought hmmmm it's kind of dry and not too tasty. So we cut into the chocolate bar. The cream inside was nice but once again the donut itself didn't wow us. Next was the birthday cake which the frosting and sprinkles was it's saving grace. Overall the batter of the donut was not good at all. We were both disappointed. IMHO, these donuts is more like a do nut eat it. It was like grabbing a donut from a truck stop. Sorry just being honest.",neutral,restaurant
178336,"Finally made it here after several attempts. Always too early on the weekend, so we hit other donut shops that open early mornings on weekends we are up and about with sunrise. This place opens 9 am on weekends! So the donuts look appealing, several large donuts, glazed, chocolate, Nutella. These are twice the size of regular donuts. Today, the large glazed was a little under cooked for me. It was doughy, when pulling apart, the pieces could be rolled into an almost raw like consistency. I don't care for that. The old fashion was too dried out, dry and stale. They pulled it from a large tray but I don't know how long they where sitting out, but just to dry for me. Got two of the cream brÃ»lÃ©e, good donut with hard glaze on top stuffed with cream filling. Tasted like vanilla pudding instead of real cream. Not bad for what it was. Next thing that we tried was the Boston cream bars. They where good, love the chocolate glaze, again the vanilla pudding cream taste and not truly the real cream flavor. I am not thinking it was a great choice today. Not completely opposed to trying again, but was not terribly impressed.",neutral,restaurant
178458,"I've tried donut bar before, but I came here for the ice cream donut cone. They don't serve them til after 10 am, so plan accordingly if you want to try it. I also ordered the creme brÃ»lÃ©e and strawberry cheesecake. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e has a hard caramelized top that I think is way too thick. The filling inside was really good, however the donut itself was a little dry. The strawberry cheesecake had an ample amt of filling but the dough was also dry. Onto the reason I came here...the cone isn't really a donut. It's more like a pastry covered in sugar. The soft serve was good, but for $6, would I get it again? No",neutral,restaurant
178460,I wasn't that happy about the customer service this time. The lady who works there was looking at me from the window the whole time while I was trying to figure out where I can park. So I get down and ask if I can park there. She says no you have to move forward and pay for parking. Even though I was going to be in and out. She was kind of pushy when it came to me ordering. First she says she will help me then she tells me to go to the other lady. They didn't have the French toast donut. We spent 4 dollars on 2 small donuts. They're good but I was not pleased with the service this time. I didn't feel like they were friendly like the people I met before.,neutral,restaurant
178526,"The good: service was great! The Filipino girl at the front line is a great ambassador. She's really warm and super helpful. And despite getting our drink order wrong, she was apologetic and quickly made good on their error. The not so good: the donuts are okay. Great novelty flavors, names and combos. But none it them really knocked our socks off. They make for great photos but none of them made me feel like I had to go out of my way to come back here. I didn't realize it's the same franchise as the Donut Bar in San Diego.",neutral,restaurant
178567,"3.5 Love all the flavor choices and cool decorations. My favorite had to be the lemon pistachio, was a little disappointed with the creme brÃ»lÃ©e and that was the one I was so looking forward to try. Staff was very nice and helpful. Clean bakery with the racks of fresh donuts. Used Yelp deal for a free large coffee with purchase of a dozen.",neutral,restaurant
178578,"I was excited to have found this place when I went to Vegas for EDC weekend. I was actually looking for a churro place but I guess this place popped up for their cone dipped in cinnamon sugar. Even more excited that the shuttle got lost and dropped us around the corner from Donut Bar!! So why 3 stars? Let me break it down: Ambience: 5/5. No complaints. Not the strip, and not a glamorous neighborhood, but inside is cute, the donuts all look amazing. Clean, etc. The board and menu is cute as well. Service: 5/5. The girl who helped us out was patient. It was kind of hard being a short Asian to try to see the donuts displayed in the back and not in the counter. She was super friendly, cheery, and overall nice. Service was quick. Layout: Definitely up with the social media trends with the hashtags and the sign so you can instagram those ginormous and beautiful looking donuts. But the most important part is the donut itself..... Donut/Pastries: 2.5/5. The donuts LOOK amazing. So much variety. Different sizes. Awesome flavor combinations. I bought 6 donuts. A whole box for $16. BUT the donut itself was so disappointing. The batter was dry and thick. Closer to an old-fashioned when it wasnt supposed to be. We got there right when they opened at 8am so its not stale. Its just the batter itself. All the donuts had the same batter so even if the frosting was different, the dry batter was still the same. Creme brulee donut was one of the top ones according to yelp and the girl, but even though the filling (amount was also inconsistent since I bought two), it still didnt moisten the dry batter. However, the crunch of breaking it was satisfying. The maple cinnamon which I figured was the closest to a churro was burnt near the top and edges but gooey in the middle. However it was too sweet. Perhaps it was the maple. I still ate 90%. I really wanted to like this place but their actual donuts were all disappointing. Could not use the #bestdonutsintheworld. Sorry! P.s. Apparently, the cone only is available after 10am. So I never even got what I came for. The rating is purely on the 3.5 stars rounded down to 3 as I do not think its overhyped for the donut itself. Everything was good though. Come for the novelty and not for the best donut in your life.",neutral,restaurant
178582,"We got the closing special so we tried a lot of donuts. Honestly I think they're okay. I've had specialty donuts and these were cool but I wouldn't come back. I didn't particularly care for any of them, I didn't like the donut batter itself. The crÃ¨me brulee wasn't sweet enough and I don't normally like super sweet things but something was just off. These aren't bad but aren't the best specialty donuts I've had. The search continues!",neutral,restaurant
178637,"Not everything I was expecting it to be. I was so hyped up from what I've seen on social media but Donut Bar just ended up being okay. The service was good. We did order online, got a confirmation email & then when we showed up they never received our order. We ordered 20 donuts online for us and friends, so I couldn't remember all the exact donuts. I ordered what I did remember and the girl that helped us was extremely sweet and threw in some extra donuts for the inconvenience, which we appreciated. As for the donuts, they were all just standard donuts. The only amazing donut was the pop tart donut. It was incredible & totally lived up to the hype!! Our creme brÃ»lÃ©e donuts were soggy on the bottom and the dough tasted like burnt oil. The raspberry cheesecake didn't taste like raspberry cheesecake at all. The lemon blueberry was decent. The original donuts were good but nothing special. Overall I was just hoping for amazing donuts but they were all subpar. Minus the poptart donut, everything was okay. I've had better donuts at places like Donut Mania or Fractured Prune.",neutral,restaurant
178642,"Don't get me wrong, the donuts WERE GOOD... but they weren't exceptional or phenomenal (to me). If you enjoy cake-batter like heavy donuts, then these will be right up your alley. But if you're more into fluffy doughy donuts, then these are not for you. My boyfriend and I landed in Vegas on a Saturday morning and headed straight to Donut Bar at 8am hoping for some fresh donuts. We got there around 830AM & there was no line when we walked in. The second we entered, the room filled with sweet smelling goodness. All the donuts LOOKED AMAZING. We bought 2 dozen for our entire group of friends. So we basically tried every single Donut they had to offer. And I mean I actually tried a bite of every single one.. and I wasn't too amazed. Maybe I was just overhyped? The price was pretty high too. The doughnuts are HUGE.. But bigger is not always better. They ranged from $2-5 depending on which flavor. We ended up spending about $75 for 2 dozen. Most likely I would not come back here again, but it doesn't hurt to try if you're a first timer! I would definitely recommend heading to the east coast if you're on the hunt for real delicious donuts!",neutral,restaurant
178652,With all the good reviews I thought this place has to be good. We thought we hit the jackpot when we went there for happy hour. We purchased a whole box of donuts for $10. They put as much donuts that they could fit into the box. We got a good selection of donuts but we were not wowed. This was shocking to me because the hubs loves donuts. It was just not our cup of tea.,neutral,restaurant
178693,"Pre-ordered on their website (available from 3-9pm the prior day). Choice to pick up at 8, 9, or 10 am. Minimum order of 1 dozen. Not all flavors are available for pre-order (didn't realize this was the case until pickup). Friendly customer service. They have a coffee/espresso bar as well. The Sumpton coconut cold brew sold by the single serve carton was really good. Not too sweet with a hint of coconut. Notes for the donuts I tasted this time: db Nutella - didn't really taste like Nutella, more like milk chocolate with crushed almonds on top. Really large size, frosting was borderline too thin for the size of the donut. The donut part had good flavor and texture on it's own, which is always a good sign. Creme brÃ»lÃ©e - smallest in size, but I appreciated that. Really enjoyed the crunchy sugar crust. The cream was also the perfect sweetness. My favorite of the bunch. Butter beer - larger size. I was expecting a pronounced butterscotch flavor, but didn't even get a hint. The Harry Potter theme was cute. Lemon pistachio - larger size. Hey, this one actually tastes like lemon and pistachio! Good balance of sweetness with the lemon. S'mores on fire - standard ""normal"" size. The most aesthetically pleasing. The only cake donut of the dozen. Didn't care for the actual donut part which was a little dry and lacking chocolate flavor. The marshmallow on top was good; probably made in-house? Maple bacon - bar shape, normal sized. I'm a fan of the whole salty/ sweet thing, but this was just ok. Caramel latte - larger size. Had good caramel flavor, but didn't detect any coffee at all. I feel like the names of the donuts set up certain expectations, but when the flavors weren't there, it was disappointing. I am willing to give them another shot though, since I did enjoy the creme brÃ»lÃ©e.",neutral,restaurant
178734,"Items Sampled: Cinnamon Roll Blueberry Pop Tart Blueberry Meyer Lemon Cake Maple Bacon Bar Vanilla Cream Bar with Chocolate Glaze Red Velvet Triple Chocolate Samoa Vanilla Glazed Chocolate Glazed with Peanuts Snickers - Peanuts, Chocolate, Caramel Twix - Peanut Butter, Caramel Fresh off an Orange County shutter reportedly due to inflated real estate rates, an import from San Diego intended to replace O-Face Doughnuts which recently closed in Downtown Las Vegas for reasons just the same, it was during the soft-opening that a stop was made at Donut Bar, the friendly manager and his team all-but giving away product - a total of three purchased by myself and a friend yielding a total order of sixteen. Having myself already visited the San Diego location, parking a serious issue for good-yet-expensive goods that failed to wow in the same way as Sidecar, Blue Star or Stan's in LA, arrival at Donut Bar Las Vegas shows little to have changed from the space's previous occupant and although coffee has been replaced by Stumptown the prices are equally as aggressive while a general lack of seating remains. A bit picked over at 1:45pm on Saturday, the Fritter gone but a dozen novel options including cake, raised and Specials all accounted for, service at Donut Bar takes a page from the youthful kids at O-Face and currently using a few staff from sunny SoCal to educate cashiers as well as customers the knowledgebase and readiness speak to experience and the Turn-Key location, though quality of the fried dough will certainly need some tweaks. Taking the goods elsewhere to eat, conversation about everything from music to donuts and the local dining scene spanning across two-plus hours of small tastes, a first look at Donut Bar's raised options speaks of sharable portions that may help to soften the $3/each pricing and with a soft center somewhere between Brioche and Angelfood the texture shines in the setting of several glazes, classic candy bars no doubt playing a role in several of the variants. Clearly needing some time to adjust to the desert with items featuring cocoa powder, both the triple chocolate and red velvet far too dry to be enjoyed, additional cake options were hit-and-miss in terms of consistency, the Blueberry Meyer Lemon unfortunately tasting as though it comes from the same mix sold for 69-cents elsewhere while the Girl scout themed Samoa was far more toothsome, perhaps as a result of coconut oil that several local Vegan bakers use to retain moistness in their cakes. Not really shocking anyone with Maple Bacon Bars in 2016, the Vanilla Cream-filled Long John equally yawn inducing but more tasty overall, Cinnamon Rolls kept under warming lamps fail to hit the same highs as nearby Glutton or other artisans like Mothership or CRAFTKitchen despite a similar price per portion, the signature ""Big Poppa"" appropriately compared to ""Fair Food"" by a youngster joining in our tasting, the added jelly almost admitting that the Pop Tart alone is nothing but a gimmick and nowhere near the housemade quality of jams, creams and compotes made daily at O-Face. TWO AND A HALF STARS: Recently seeing a growth in diversity as relates to donuts, nearby Pawn Donuts and Coffee sourcing better from Donut Mania while Real Donuts on Charleston fares slightly better in texture at nearly half the price only half a mile away, one hopes that Donut Bar received a more favorable lease than that which doomed O-Face or their OC Location...or that they have some tricks besides freebies to help bolster their branding before they are too far out of the gate.",neutral,restaurant
178771,It's a doughnut shop. If you like specialty Donuts you'll probably like this place. Personally I'm not a big doughnut fan and the one I tried was just incredibly sweet. Too sweet in my opinion but others may not think so. Service was very good and friendly. Their lattes are horrible however. On top of that I burnt my mouth on the first sip. I like giving other businesses over Starbucks my money when it comes to specialty coffees but I have to look for someplace other than Donut Bar to get one.,neutral,restaurant
178801,"Of course I'm sure the ""regular"" donuts tasted far better.. but we arrived at 10am and found there to be only 3 vegan options. The apple fritter was so burnt it was black on top. I got it anyways hoping that inside would be a delicious fritter experience... nope. Dry and tasted burnt. Tossed in the trash. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e was alright. I have had better. The last was a cake donut. Can't even remember the flavor. It was good. But not good enough to spend the amount of money I did. I would much rather got to Voodoo Donuts where they have atleast 10 different AMAZING vegan donuts at one time.",neutral,restaurant
178823,"Not bad doughnuts, but way too big in my opinion. I know bigger I better, but if you don't eat them warm, they dry out pretty quick. Good selection and different flavors. But I'll probably end up staying with some other local doughnuts for my regular everyday needs.",neutral,restaurant
178872,"Service girl was pushing French toast donut. Told her didn't want that. Asked what some of them had in them and she mumbled something. If the donuts didn't look so delicious I would've walked out. By the way, none of them were very nice. After choosing what I wanted to buy, she tried selling the French donut again. And again while she was boxing my donuts. Oh boy, was she going for the grand price, was she going to get a bonus??? When I got home, the donuts were very disappointing. Pumpkin spice donut? Not at all taste like pumpkin. The donuts with filling in them? What filling, had to find the cream filling in most of them. I will not be back. Would've give them a one star, except that the Boston Cream was the only one that were very good.",neutral,restaurant
178876,"We were looking for a donuts on our way out of Las Vegas. After looking at the pictures we deciding to go here. The donuts look wonderful, but unfortunately that is where it ends. The flavor was not matching what I was expecting. I got two donuts but they were just sub par. I had better in regular grocery store. It was a disappointment.",neutral,restaurant
178879,"While not mind-blowing in taste, the donuts are of quality. Yeast donuts are the game here, not cake, and so you will find fluffy, fresh, artsy indulgences here. It's all about the Instagram-worthy photo opportunities. If that's your thing, along with jumping on an undeserved hype bandwagon, you'll love it. If you enjoy donuts for taste and nostalgia, then graded meh+. Continuing the trend of designer donuts, DB rolled on to the scene in 2016. Since then, there's been a dedicated following. They will tell you as much on their website, which is a paragraph or two of self back-patting about celebrities and high-profile mentions. People love it! I like it. When people who haven't been ask about it, I reply, ""it's fine."" What has me unimpressed can be boiled down to one word: frantic. -- Parking is abysmal thanks to the location. It often can't be found or you're charged for a 15minute run-in to grab a box. -- On multiple occasions when I was first trying to check them out, they were sold out before noon. Set yourself up for disappointment before you even arrive. Donuts are a morning treat, a routine, a comfort food item. I've never experienced a donut shop that has as part of its marketing that, ""hey! we're soooo popular, we run out of our own product before it's even time for lunch, so get on down and fight for a parking spot and a donut. Whee!"" -- The inside is decorated trendy pop pop fun fun, part of the whole experience. But the space inside is cramped, uncomfortable. You walk in and your back is against the wall in a tight funnel herding you towards ordering, which makes everything feel urgent urgent urgent. HURRY. Claustrophobic? Go to a more spacious donut shop that doesn't run out of product, has hospitable parking, and allows you some elbow room for moving about. I will say, though: those French toast donuts I turned my nose up at? Pretty incredible. ALMOST worth the effort to gamble on there being one available.",neutral,restaurant
178887,"The atmosphere was great. The staff is awesome. The donuts look amazing, but I was not overly impressed with what I got. I had the creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut and the Elvis donut. Maybe I was expecting too much. I regret not trying the other ones I had considered. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e was weird. The burnt sugar didn't work for me with the donut. It was a little too thick and works much better when it's just over a custard. The Elvis had a peanut butter topping and a banana Bavarian cream center. Loved the peanut butter but hated the cream. It tasted like banana candy. Very artificial. I love banana and peanut butter, but real banana is better. Maybe I'll try it again in the future, but currently I don't think paying for parking is worth it.",neutral,restaurant

179071,"Promised my daughter I would take her here to try the nutella donut she has been dying to sink her teeth into. Came in on a Saturday morning around 11am to find a small line of about 5 people formed waiting to place their orders. Donuts are priced individually. Picked up two nutella overloads, one strawberry cheesecake and one toasted coconut; total came to $13. Nutella Overload: Nothing to call home about. In my opinion, there was no 'overload' of nutella present. This donut is basically a nutella-filled donut with powdered sugar dusted heavily on top. Strawberry Cheesecake: This is a jelly filled donut (I believe strawberry jelly - hence the strawberry in the name), with a glazed topping and a dusting pile of what I believe is graham crackers. I don't get any cheesecake from this donut, so I don't know why they find the need to call it a strawberry cheesecake donut. Toasted Coconut: An old fashion cake donut with toasted coconut on top. If you like coconut, you will enjoy the coconut topping. Overall, these donut were not terrible but they were not donuts that I 'gotta have' next time in Vegas. Side note - there is metered parking right in front of the business which only takes credit cards. Best bet, have someone drop you off and circle around and pick you up to save money on parking!",neutral,restaurant
179086,They ran out of a lot of donuts by the time I got there so I ordered what was left. So I got the PB&J and thought it was just okay. The donuts were $1.50-$3 each but they are huge so that justifies the cost. I might come back at and earlier time to try freshly made donuts. The donuts texture is somewhere between a Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donut texture.,neutral,restaurant

179616,"THOUGHTS: Overall, just a trendy hype. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. This is not to say that others may leave overwhelmed. I went with a group of three on a Saturday night. Line was out the door, but service was efficient. My intent was to order the egg waffle; at least, that's why I made the trek. I saw the assistant in the back bring the egg waffles out upon order and they were quite soggy, rather than crispy. So, I opted for a macaron instead. I sampled three flavors; taro, graham cracker, and Oreo mocha. Sadly, they were all too light in flavor - like water. I was embarrassed to ask for a four sample, so I just went with GC. Overall, it was okay. I feel the hype is more so for the aesthetic and trendy options they provide (like egg waffle, churro sandwich, etc.). My guest ordered a churro sandwich and waited 20 minutes for it (we were quoted 5 minutes). We found out later on it was crossed off the list. They did apologize though. It was something to cross off my list, but I don't plan to return.",neutral,restaurant
179652,Very tasty ice cream in delicious and unusual combinations. The cinnamon toast crunch was my favorite. The space is very cute and so is the staff! There is also a great selection of vegan options.,neutral,restaurant
179656,"Cute little ice cream parlor in the heart of a gentrified neighborhood. They only had 3 vegan selections to choose from and 2 out of the 3 weren't at all tasty.

The guy that took my order was pretty cool and very accommodating, he explained the ice creams that I tasted which was helpful.",neutral,restaurant
179695,Weird flavors. And after trying Jeni's this was well below. People behind the counter were great. I don't mind some weird flavors but most were weird like rosemary sea salt caramel. It tasted like foccacia bread as opposed to ice cream.,neutral,restaurant
179708,"This ice cream shop comes really close to making the mark, but the ice cream texture was very watery and full of ice crystals. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of flavors of ice creams offered and thought many were very creative. However many were lacking in intensity of flavor, coming off as a little bland. In addition, there was something off with the consistency of the ice cream itself. Many flavors I sampled felt a little watery and not as creamy as they could be. The ice cream here is about average, especially if you compare the product to Jeni's ice cream.",neutral,restaurant
179846,"RUDE! The ice-cream was good, but the blonde at the register was rude and the music was terrible.",neutral,restaurant
179849,"So I finally made my way to University area to try out this ultra cool looking ice cream spot who posts cool looking ice cream sandwiches on social media. I'd been very excited to try it out for a while so I popped by to taste their newly released ""dunkaroo"" milkshake because it looked so amazing! When we arrived there were about 6 people in line ahead of us so we got in a socially distant line and sort of made the line snack around the closed bar and window area. There was plenty of room and no crowding at all. The young lady behind the register proceeded to yell out "" y'all need to form a line OUTSIDE, you all can't make a line inside"". Mind you there's plenty space and capacity limits are a thing of the past but we all obliged to being literally kicked out of the store. Fun fact: there was literally a thunderstorm taking place outside. Thunder, lightning, torrential downpour and sideways rain. *upside down* smiley face. The weather was so bad we all came right back inside despite having just been kicked out because we didn't feel safe at all. Once we all came back in and reformed our original line the same young lady says ""oh I didn't know it was storming out""................... Well, that in itself pretty much ruined the entire experience for me. I kindly suggest perhaps not kicking your customers out so forcefully or without a solid and legitimate explanation. It didn't feel good to be thrown out into a thunderstorm. So, eventually I ordered the dunkaroo shake from the nice young fella behind the register (who was not part of the ""kick out"" crew). The shake was okay. Didn't taste much like the dunkaroos I loved as a kid but it wasn't bad. It also did not come as pictured. My shake was missing the yummy looking rim and apparently I had to ask for it to be added. Which is kind of misleading since it's pictured with that already on it. So once I got my shake I was disappointed immediately because of that missing piece and at that point I was too over it all to even ask about it being missing. I drank/ate about half of it and tossed it in the trash on the way out. We also ordered a brownie vanilla ice cream sandwich with Cinnamon Toast Crunch and that was really good. That's about the best part of the visit. Maybe this place just wasn't my scene or it was just a bad day. It seems like they do a great job with creative shakes and ice cream sandwiches that are definitely picture worthy. Probably worth checking out if you've never been but I personally will pass in the future.",neutral,restaurant
179913,This was pretty decent. I tried the strawberry shortcake yum-ee bun. They do something pretty cool that allows the bun to stay warm but the ice cream in the middle doesn't melt. The bun tastes like a sweet dinner roll but not as sweet as a donut. The ice cream is normal strawberry ice cream. The person I was with had a cookie dough milkshake and they thought it was decent. I did see some pretty cool looking other options.,neutral,restaurant
179977,This place was kinda cool and had lots of fancy looking treats. The menu isn't really anywhere you can see while standing in line though. We got the boo berry milkshake with the edible rim and it looked yummy but the shake was pretty bland. Not sure if all the shakes taste that bland but for how much they are they should promote other flavors for shakes beside vanilla. I do love cereal in milkshakes though. It's my favorite!,neutral,restaurant
180183,"After stopping here on several occasions, I've yet to figure out the hype. It must be rooted in the tradition and memories this place invokes for a lot of Pittsburghers. All local soft serve establishments run together for me, and this one is no exception. You'll get a good basic cone, a standard milkshake, or a decent banana boat, but it's otherwise nothing to write home about. I still don't understand their system either as different cashiers shift in and out of the 4 windows. Some people pay when ordering, some when the items are ready to be picked up (cash only mind you). There is always general confusion about who's order belongs to whom as they are typically busy. It's a Pittsburgh staple though, and worth the annual visit.",neutral,restaurant
180399,"I was very underwhelmed with my latest purchase from Page. The Hot Nancy B - a great concept with warm chocolate chip cookies, hot fudge, ice cream, and whipped cream - suffered greatly from a lack of execution in three of the four components. Page continues to have the best texture of soft serve ice cream around, hands down. The flavor and sweetness were lacking which provided a very weak base for the rest of the sundae. The fudge, although deep and luxurious in appearance, again lacked flavor... it's amazing what a little salt and sugar could do to transform this into something great. The whipped cream is left unsweetened... this is a great concept to contrast a sundae that is exceptionally sweet, but in this application it simply fell flat. The cookies were far and away the best component... a thick and crispy exterior with large, melting gobs of chocolate inside and a balanced sweetness to contrast the thick, velvety ice cream. This will not prevent me from returning, but I hope the next time is a bit more satisfying.",neutral,restaurant
180404,"This place was just okay. I had the cookie sundae and my fiance had the brownie sundae. We both kind of watched, horrified, as the girl making our sundaes ran our cookies and brownies through a warmer in one of those cheap plastic containers. I mean I know I'm eating ice cream which is sooo healthy, but a little cancer from warming up plastic with the food you're gonna eat never hurt anyone either...The price for the sundaes seemed a little high to me at first but the more I ate the more I realized we really did get our money's worth. This is definitely better than dairy queen and it has a good ice cream shop atmosphere if you're looking for some good soft serve treats.",neutral,restaurant

180770,"I needed to pass some time before a show last night so I stopped here. I have never paid attention to it before but it caught my eye. The long store is filled with all kinds of candy. Everything that can contain vast quantities of sugar is here. I was looking for some ice cream. I walked along the cases to see what flavors they had. I like the fact that they have stickers with the names of the ice cream flavors and what the ice cream is. While just looking, I was asked twice my different staff if I wanted a sample. Even after I ordered, I was asked if I wanted a sample to make sure I was OK with my order. I declined the samples but it was good customer service. I got a regular which is 2 scoops of ice cream. One was Vincenzo's Nutella vanilla and the other was Richard's Riot. The Nutella is vanilla ice cream with Nutella. Richard's Riot was coffee ice cream with toasted almonds, coffee chunks, and toffee. I paid with Apple Pay and was soon in the Grand Canal Shops where there are some benches and one high top table with no chairs. There is no seating in the very packed store. The ice cream was good with the Nutella being my favorite of the two. The scoops are small but the price isn't, but it's what I expected before I entered. This is the Strip and the Grand Canal Shops are high rent shops. I'd stop in again if I need some ice cream. I liked their variety of non-traditional flavors.",neutral,restaurant
180826,"This is kind of teetering on a two star rating but the ice cream was pretty good and the service was fantastic so I swung it up to three. At this price, up-charging for waffle bowls that are so stale that they are kind of gross is not cool. I pay about the same per treat at Ghirardelli and they have never given me anything that was even slightly less than perfect. This was my first and possibly last visit to this place and the waffle bowls were so disgusting that we ended up throwing them away after paying extra for them. It's too bad because they're in a great location and we really did like the ice cream. I'm a dark chocolate fanatic and they had multiple options for me. I guess you can get it in a non-edible bowl but that kind of sucks the joy out of it.",neutral,restaurant

The place is nice, there was a long line and there's actually two servers and they take turns for payments so it took us a long time to get our 2 scoops of ice cream. I wanted to get the classic circus box sundae but they said they were out. So I just ordered the regular ice cream 2 scoops. The serving was small comsidering i paid almost 9$ for my ice team, very small serving and it's not that good as well. For me, it's too sweet! I ordered the chunky chocolate, and the one with Oreos! I did not see much chunky chocolate chips or like oreo cookies in my Ice cream so I was very disappointed.

But if you are truly having a sugar fit you can buy it here no complains. The way you can get lured into here is the colorful ambience and the way the store is design. Its almost the candy house of from Hansel and Gretel in the middle of the forest but this one is inside the grand canal shops.

180929,"This small bake shop is located off Freedom drive. We made our way there on a Tuesday afternoon. There is limited seating, and limited options in regards to desserts. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting. There were a couple different cookie flavors, one brownie and the oatmeal cream pies. Aside from that there were a variety of coffee drinks to choose from. We attempted to come a few days before, but they were sold out. I could see that happening with the limited supply of baked goods. Though the oatmeal cream pie was good, I'm not sure the it was worth $4.50. The actual cookie portion was tasty, the filling was overwhelmingly sweet with a hint marshmallow flavor. I will say, we fell for the yelp hype on this one. Not sure we'll be returning.",neutral,restaurant
181003,"I admit--I bought into the Instagram hype on this one. I'd been following this place since they opened their doors and I'd seen several 'Charlotte celebrities' raving about the place. So I wanted to love it. I drove well over an hour to love it. But...I don't love it. Well, that's not exactly true--the puddle cookie was delicious. One of the best cookies I've ever had, in fact. We followed the instructions of The Batch Maker's cult following on Instagram, and got a couple of everything to bring home--two puddle cookies, two Oreo truffle cookies, two cereal killer muffins, two oatmeal cream pies, two s'mores brownies, and one piece of banana Nutella bread. It was also 26 degrees, so we sprung for two hot chocolates and two coffees, too. And $71 later (yep, SEVENTY-ONE; I about had a heart attack), we left there wholly underwhelmed. Again, the puddle cookie was delicious, and even the banana Nutella bread was pretty tasty. The Oreo truffle cookie was okay, but ultra rich--have some milk handy for this one. The oatmeal cream pies were fine, though the cream is nearly overwhelmingly sweet. However, the two things I've heard so many rave reviews about left me beyond disappointed. The cereal killer muffin isn't really a muffin at all. It has the flavor and density of pound cake, except it has cereal crumbled on top. Not sure why there's a fuss over these. I don't get it. Not a ton of flavor--just dense, cakey blah.  Finally, the s'mores brownies. I was so excited! And they were beautiful! And I LOVE chocolate--the richer, the better. Unfortunately, the two we brought home were inedible. They weren't simply rich and moist (though they are the richest things I've ever put in my mouth--shockingly and sickeningly so)--they weren't even gooey. They were simply under-baked. Nearly raw inside. Barely staying together. I was so disappointed. I for sure don't need to drive over an hour to come here again. And even if I was in the neighborhood, I probably wouldn't stand in line again, especially for the damage that was done to my poor wallet.",neutral,restaurant

181371,"Finally bit the bullet and got in line for the crepes. I've been to the market countless times and always pass it by because I don't want to wait in line (same for the gyros). I purposely didn't check the time because I didn't want to know how long it would take, but the line moved pretty slowly. All I could think the whole time was how much the coffee place next door must hate them because I heard so many people say ""wow look at the line for coffee!"" and keep walking, which I myself did several times before I realized the line was for crepes only. I don't know if the crepe people have much control over the layout of their stand, but I would think they should consider swapping where the prep area and cook areas are if they can. It would make ordering a lot easier, and probably faster since the guy taking orders wouldn't be shouting over 10 people ""who's next? what did you say?!"" repeatedly, because as it's currently set up he's trying to take orders while standing about as far away as possible from the person who is next up to give their order. Anyway, the crepes themselves were really good, and I enjoyed watching them make them. They were a good value for $6-7. I got the Florence for myself (spinach, egg, gruyere), and a peanut butter and banana for my son. I ended up eating most of his, and actually liked it better than my own.

181603,"I followed Hopscotch's buzz before ever tasting its baked goods. When we first moved to CU in 1993, there was only one upscale bakery in town and we longed for more and different. Now, we have a few to choose from, but more and different is always good. Hopscotch is a new take on the upscale bakery, a hipster one, with a particular decor style that is at once vintage and subdued with a modern twist. Think de-colorsatured roses, flattened, or cakes barely iced with embedded contrasting grit. I like this aesthetic -- it seems fresh and understated to me. I first tasted Hopscotch's products after purchasing them at a local arts pop-up. I bought a brownie and some kind of brown sugar butter bar. The brownie was truly phenomenal if you like fudge (rather than cake) style brownies, and I love them. The chocolate was so dark and dense it was like having my tongue immersed in a deep chocolate groove. The brownie had a soft, chewy bite and wasn't overly sweet. The other bar had good taste: brown sugar meets browned butter, but it was dry and crumbly. When Hopscotch opened in the new Art Mart space, I tried another brownie, and it was as good as the first. So, high marks on consistency. I recently went back and tried a strawberry baby cake for me and a white chocolate brownie for my son. I loved the baby cake itself as well as the fresh strawberry compote on top. The cake was moist and tender, the compote had great strawberry flavor. Neither was overly sweet. I did not like the disc of heavy buttercream frosting that sat on top of these. It had the texture of refrigerated butter and did not eat well with the more tender components. Although I suppose my standard for all such strawberry cakes is the enchanting cassata, a softer frosting would move this baby cake toward perfection. My son did not like the white chocolate brownie, although he loves both brownies and white chocolate. He thought the brownie was greasy and salty. It had moved from a fudgy texture to a fatty one without enough flour to support a good bite. Embedded in the bar were bits of white chocolate, which he said was the only positive note. Given Hopscotch's stiff prices ($8 for a baby cake, $4 for a brownie), one expects products to be truly exceptional, without any missteps. I believe there's real quality here and that products are sometimes worth the price. Hopscotch uses carefully sourced, superior ingredients; good technique; and a refined aesthetic. There's a great deal of potential here, but all of the products are not quite yet perfected. And, to be fair, I haven't yet tried many of Hopscotch's other products, although the case is full of tempting options (full sized cakes, meringues, and more). I will also add that I had one encounter with the owner (Kaya Tate) that disappointed me. When her new website went up, she asked followers on Facebook for feedback. I provided some, much of it positive, especially about the website's look & feel and navigation. However, I also said that I thought the landing page should open with something about the deliciousness of the products rather than ethics, originality, etc. The Hopscotch owner wrote back to defend her choices. I replied that I understood why she'd made those choices -- I get how important food ethics and authenticity (localism, etc.) are to the hipster culinary scene -- but stood by my point that what I want first in a bakery is tasty products. How the products get that way can follow. The owner replied again to defend her choices. To me, this was a misstep in a customer interaction. She had every right to disagree with my feedback, but she should have simply thanked me and moved on. Despite this rather sour interaction, I am rooting for Hopscotch.",neutral,restaurant

We left pretty much everything except the ice cream untouched. The matcha ice cream itself is pretty good though. I'm not a big fan of matcha so I can't comment on the quality of the matcha. In terms of ambience and decor, Matcha CafÃ© Maiko has nailed their theme and concept. The interior is aesthetic, clean, and comfortable; it's a great place to hang out and chat.

I grew up with Polish nalesniki which are just homemade crepes with any filling you could desire. So when the crepe rage hit the US, I was underwhelmed. But I wanted something sweet and it was late in the evening, this place was close by and open. I love the sitting arrangements in this place. They have futon couches, tables and bar seating near the window. Plenty of choices for whatever sitting mood you're in (that's a thing, ya know?!) I choose the futon couches with the sparkly pillows. That's the kind of mood I was in. You place your order, have a seat, and then they call you up when your order is ready. We split the mango-berry crepe. I wasn't expecting it to come out looking like a cone. But ok cool, easy to hold. I'm a fan. The taste was good, on the positive it wasn't too sweet or over soaked, on the negative I do wish it had more cream filling throughout and not just on the bottom. All in all....

You would definitely miss it if you aren't paying attention. This is a place you can sit down to eat . This is a take out spot only that houses multiple business. Order: you have the option to order online or order inside at the kiosk. Highly recommend ordering online to avoid a long wait. It took about 20mins for me to get my order. Parking: There is a small lot in front of the South End Eats building. My order: Peach Cobbler you don't get much for $8 but it was worth trying . It was lukewarm at best. It had a nice crust to cobbler ratio (if you know you know).

102437,"Hired for his transportation services, a former mercenary and his wife accompanying a secret convoy to a Soviet military base find it overrun by a gigantic snake and must battle the creature to get out alive.This here turned out rather decently overall, though it's better than might be expected. The location being kept in the darkened military base underground with its tight, cramped quarters and endless corridors always it to have a bit of a creepier feel than expected, especially when it winds itself up and really lets loose in the second half. That it focuses on the more traditional forms of suspense with its wailing cry off in the distance and being hidden away in the location makes these scenes far better than expected, and generally makes it quite exciting at times. While it does provide a nice body count within, the fact that the CGI for the snake is so ludicrous that it rarely looks realistic enough and really takes that away from the film. Also quite flawed is the fact that it doesn't really have a sequel feel to it, with little to connect it to the first one other than one character, and that's not saying much else for it. It's also got a tendency to fall into cliché far too often and feel reminiscent of too many other films when it could've done something unique with the material. That quality with the CGI, though, is the film's real true falling grace and what holds it down.Rated R: Violence and Language.",positive,movie

The storyline is simple and easy to follow, it hints towards the parodies within it instead of trying to mask them into the story, and the actors, while not a-listers, played the roles perfectly.It wasn't scary, or thrilling but it wasn't made for that purpose. What it's made for is the laughs, and they're definitely included.It's not the best film in the world, but it's one I wouldn't turn my nose to.",positive,movie
102494,"So, just to start... this movie is obviously not the newer Puss In Boots that was attached to the Shrek movie franchise. This is a whole different movie and, not, as some on here would have you believe, trying to cash in on the Shrek movie... mostly because this movie came out two years before the Shrek movie.That said, this is an odd film. My kids turned it on via Netflix streaming and when I joined them for a minute, I couldn't turn away.For starters, you can tell it's Shatner doing the voice of Puss quite easily, so there's a little mind eff going on almost immediately. The way he carries himself, you expect him to break into Rocket Man at any moment. Then, the animation is a little, um, different. It really looks like the very non-fluid movement that you see in the Korean news animations that have become popular lately, but with better developed characters. Plus, it's not that the characters are ""dirty"" or anything, but, you do see a little more cleavage than you would in, say, a Disney flick... or a Shrek or any other US created movie.The story is also a bit more, um, European, I guess. It's hard to describe. Growing up watching US cartoons, you don't realize how weird some of the old fairy tales really are in their original form. This story is more like the old stories and has some visual elements that would probably be really enjoyable if you were on various mind-altering substances.All that in mind, the kids ate it up and actually ended up watching it again the next day. So, give it a watch, be prepared for the weird, and use your friggin' head when you think it's a ""rip off"" of something that came out two years later.",positive,movie
102702,"I honestly didn't exactly know what I was getting into heading into this one. But to a pleasant surprise, this one surprised me. The acting in this film was solid, and I felt as if the actors really had heart for their characters they played. The characters we're given are unique, at times, however, presented on multiple levels with small shards of clichés, but overall entertaining, and unique enough to hold us off. The overall story I honestly felt it to be surprising. It had a good premise to where it introduces twists, and small surprises that satisfied. The story, and or premise also had some creative offerings, giving some eye opening take-ons. Keeping this review very short, the film overall was successful in holding the attention of us, audience. It was unique, refreshing, and for the most part the given story was thought provoking, new, and fresh.

Granted it does have a few moments with poorly acted dialogue and its very predictable. But the atmosphere in my opinion is very good, even when you know something is coming with the music build up, it still made me jump a few times and there's some pretty creepy stuff happening throughout. It's similar to the jumps and scares in the Grudge and other Japanese horrors.In the end it is a typical jump scare movies with a different approach.

Of course, Aamir Khan was great and he did carry a lot of the movie, but every movie I've seen with him he tends to outshine everyone else.Am I so alone? Was there ANYONE else out there that enjoyed this film? I really thought Faisal was a good fit for the character he played. Clue me in - why is everyone so harsh on this film? Is it because they can't see past Sholay? I would like to see more movies in this style; of course, there are so many Bollywood movies I might die before I am about to see 1/5 of them, but I always remember to turn off my brain and try to see the film as the directors meant it to be seen; and not to make comparisons. If we tried to compare every actor to Aamir, they'd all be found wanting.All the Best to everyone; and chin up, Faisal! Someone out here thinks you are a success at what you do.

103085,"First off, I have to give this film a 7/10 not because I liked it, but because my youngest kids (4 and 6) loved it. You know the sort of movie that puts you to sleep but your kindergarten kids just soak right in? Films like Bionicles or HotWheels are better than a sedative, but this one isn't quite so bad thanks to the Godzilla footage and little side-stories the kids will ignore, but the adults will enjoy (admittedly not many of these, but at least they tried).the most interesting of these side stories involves the boy's friend and neighbour, the typical mussy-haired scientist-tinkerer we find in most Godzilla films. In one scene worth the price of the movie (which I got on VHS at Giant Tiger for $4) our friendly neighbourhood scientist demonstrates his new invention, an integrated monitor and keyboard desktop computer. Keep in mind this is 1968/69, Xerox PARC was only just starting to toy with such ideas in a strictly-business domain, but here in Godzilla-land they are, as usual, decades ahead of the rest of us: IIRC, the boy recommends re-tooling the workstation ... so it will play not just one, but a variety of games! Toho invented the XBox! Back to the movie, it IS possible for older audiences to watch it, but you do need to suspend your belief just a bit more than the usual acceptance of 100-foot monsters. So ... should a baby-gozilla be 4 feet high, blow smoke-rings and walk and talk? Absolutely. The key to watching this film is just as another reviewer noted, by keeping in mind that the entire film occurs inside the daydreams of a very young person. Given that, it all makes perfect sense, the plot, the dialog, the flashbacks and everything, and if you happen to actually BE a very young person, then it not only makes sense, but it enters your own life.We were setting place-mats and pillows for Minya for months after they first watched this movie.Minya fans will also be happy to know that the diminutive atomic monster returns as a principle character in the 2004 Final Wars, albeit with a non-speaking part :)",positive,movie

Didn't know till I read the comments there were scenes where it could fly. At any rate just wanted to say yeah its got its flaws...but....remember when it was made.....special effects then WERE using a puppet and making it look like a Giant!

A European production with decent location shooting, an international cast (half horrible and unintelligibly dubbed), and a real B movie budget unlike those $10 Z movie digital camcorder pretenders. It's all off course a bit predictable. (If you can't figure out two of the survivors at the end turn in your monster movie-watching card now.) And despite a lot of fodder (always a good sign) to many deaths seem off screen or at least over a little quickly. The movie also could have used some gratuitous nudity (If young thing Alex Reid wasn't willing at least allow Spanish star Neus Asensi to release those puppies like she has done in the past.)

But to enjoy the film you have to stop asking questions during the film. Then I thought the film was more like I am Legend. But no. This is not a zombie movie with a Hero to save the day. The message the movie makes is so potent. Hayden Christensen says "" I'm here because I will myself to exist"", That is proved hollow too. Then John Leguizamo comes into explain what happened. He refers to the Croatoan incident. Argument starts that what is happening could have a reason or that it is God's punishment for ""something"". That they could have been chosen etc etc. But the Film ends with the best answer. What if nothing matters?

104279,"'SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The master of all zombie films George A. Romero adds a fifth entry to his 'Of The Dead' series, which started in 1968 with the classic 'NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD'. This one is more of a comedic zombie / western spoof than a frightening thriller. For this reason the film drew a lot of criticism from fans and critics alike but Romero is famous for always trying something new. That's what's most impressive about his zombie series, not one of the installments is anything like the others. They all center on random characters trying to survive in a world of zombies and focus more on social commentary than anything else but each film has it's own unique style and character as well. While this film is not nearly as good as the original trilogy it is better than a lot of other zombie movies coming out these days.The film tells the story of two feuding Irish clans, the O'Flynns and the Muldoons, on an island off the North American coast. The O'Flynns think the proper way to deal with the zombie epidemic is to exterminate all zombies once they've become infected while the Muldoons believe they should keep zombies alive in hopes of finding a cure and assimilating them back in to society. Early on the Muldoons gain the upper-hand on the O'Flynn clan's leader Patrick (played by Kenneth Welsh). They exile him and a few followers from the island. While away Patrick hooks up with a ragtag team of ex-National Guard just looking for a place they can go to survive, they're led by Sargent 'Nicotine' Crocket (played nicely by Alan Van Sprang, who's appeared in Romero's last three zombie films). O'Flynn leads the team back to his island and enlists their help in getting revenge on the Muldoons and especially their leader Seamus (played by Richard Fitzpatrick. Along the way they also meet up with a young boy (played by Devon Bostick) and Patrick's daughter (played by Kathleen Munroe).Like I said the movie is light on scares but it does have plenty of the traditional zombie gore. The zombies in this film are extremely passive, slow and much more of a comedic nuisance most of the time than a real threat. Which a lot of Romero's fans hated about this movie. The real threat (like in all of Romero's zombie films) is man and the conflicts that we let tear us apart. As I said the movie has all of the usual Romero social commentary, this time it deals with the feuding Irish clans that would rather kill each other and prove they're right than find a peaceful way to live together. There's of course nothing new to Romero's story telling but the way he delivers it is fresh; this zombie flick is a throwback to the cheesy westerns of years past. We've never quite seen a zombie film like this before. While it doesn't live up to the original trilogy, like I said, or the nearly as impressive fourth installment 'LAND OF THE DEAD' it is superior, slightly, to Romero's last installment 'DIARY OF THE DEAD' (and like I said a lot of the other low budget zombie films being released). It's no classic but it's still got that Romero feel that no other zombie films possess. Not a great film but in my opinion it doesn't disappoint.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22OZUY3a_KI",positive,movie
104301,"Sarah Jessica Parker hasn't had the most stellar film career after ending SATC but i think it's mainly due to the fact that she immortalized the character of Carrie that no matter what role she plays from now on will seem mediocre, especially one like this which is miles away from the hip Manhattan-ite we all know and love. I don't understand the extremely low rating and terrible reviews for this movie, for me it was a lot of fun.I honestly laughed a lot through this movie and isn't that what a comedy is supposed to make a viewer do? Granted yes it may be cliché in parts but that sure is nothing new in Hollywood, the storyline is a quite done and dusted storyline but it does try to put its own kind of twist on it, helping with his are the interview shots with Christina Hendricks and Busy Philips, two women who have polar opposite ideas of what women should be and this adds a lot to the movie i thought, i personally sided with the Christina Hendricks viewpoint as i'm sure most people also do. It is only joked about but there is totally a double standard with men and women when it comes to juggling work and family and this movie handles it quite well i thought.Sarah Jessica Parker is just so easy to watch in no matter what she is in, every time you hear her voice it's like hearing and old friend, and i might add she really pulls out some comic edge in this movie, i found her hilarious, the supporting cast are also pretty good, Christina Hendricks standing out a the supportive best friend, her role is slightly underused but she still stands out, also worth mentioning is Busy Philips in a great role which is very out of character for her, she should do more comedy.So this movie is far from the greatest thing ever, but it's entertaining, easy to watch, the characters are relatable and there are lots of laughs to be had if you just go with it.

104958,"A guy wakes up in a room. There's a flashlight. He finds a kid chained to a wall. He frees him. They tinker with a wall and turns out they are inside a moving armored vehicle. No problem, they just push the door open and jump out when it stops and walk away. They are in London in the future. Well, the guys in the front aren't happy and start chasing them. The two escape to a cemetery where the kid tells him that men in red masks killed his mom. When the bad guys arrive, it turns out that Ryan has some fighting skills and he beats one of them. The other guy knows him. When Ryan starts going through his own pockets he finds a gun and a red mask. But suddenly something strange happens.Now he wakes up several days later in a room with books and with some type of plan on the wall. The bad guy is there as well. He talks to Ryan as if they work together on some project. We learn more about Ryan. He was military and confined to an institution for PTSD, panic, and anxiety. The boss and researcher there is Dr. Langham who took care of him. The bad guy is working on something that involves the kid.Again something jarring happens and Ryan wakes up having sex with a prostitute in New York days later. He remembers the kid and decides to take the prostitute with him, but first he has to go through her Russian pimp. More fights ensue. He promises her freedom of she helps him find the kid. Good thing he remembers information from the previous episodes and he notices that each time he has about 10 minutes to get things done before he's transported elsewhere. They escape but the Russians are in pursuit and they also run into the police.Next he wakes up in a room where a guy is being waterboarded by police. He's there as some physician who OKs whether to continue or stop the ""interrogation"". The victim is some researcher named Leonid. The two manage to escape. But at every turn the bad guy appears.Through more of these episodes we discover that Ryan has received some implants by a corporation run by the good Dr. Langham who now has the kid. The aim is through these implants to control people. The problem is that Ryan's implants have a connectivity issue with the satellite which is why he gets these 10 minutes where he gets to be himself. During the other times his body is controlled by Langham. Ryan with the help of the prostitute will try to stop the Langham project to control all humanity and to rescue the kid. He'll have to confront Langham and the bad guy who always shows up and is actually Langham's son.The Anomaly is interesting and a bit original. It mixes science with futuristic sci-fi with a fight action movie and all told in these short episodes. The science is the strongest aspect. There are also some interesting ideas about humanity and control. I wouldn't recommend looking for plot holes though because there are plenty. The weakest are the fights. Oddly enough it seems that the filmmakers knew the fights were weak too, and how could they not, however instead of trying to mask the weakness they further enhanced it with tricks designed to make good fights look good. Here instead we have several poor fights that looks even worse. They used some jumping camera work and Matrix-like slow-mo editing, which works when fights are fast at normal speeds. But if you have slow and weak punches to begin with and slow them down, well, the result is nothing to brag about. Another problem is the completely uncharismatic lead and a dry villain. You do end up disliking the bad guy mostly because he's a bit annoying and because his role isn't thought out well, but you certainly don't care at all for the hero. Things improve casting-wise once the lovely Alexis Knapp appears, unfortunately she doesn't get enough to do. The Anomaly is an intriguing, good looking movie that creates more expectations than it fulfills.",positive,movie

Soldiers of Fortune is not the best movie you'll ever see. It's probably not the best movie you'll see this month. The special effects, the plot and the writing leave much to be desired too. With all that said, there is a certain something about this film which made me really enjoy it. I laughed quite hard most of the way through it - some of the jokes and scenes were hilarious and some of it was just ridiculously comical.

Simple premise: wife to an abusive husband, with two children at home, goes to mall for last minute Christmas paper and promptly witnesses a murder. The criminals also happen to be four lads she has already managed to make somewhat angry. She spends the rest of the film running away from them, before taking matters into her own hands. The whole movie is total entertainment! Well filmed - the woods are very claustrophobic - well edited - always jogging along - with a few good shocks - you just have to see it ... Kim Basinger is very watchable in this. Although never one of my favourite actors (of course I loved her in LA Confidential though) she is great as the hunted turned hunter here. Very physical, she works well with the material, drawing us into her situation, we see her change, her disbelief, her final resolve - altogether a class act. Lukas Hass as one of the gang is rather unsettling with his baby face and more highly pitched voice, surprising yet effective casting. Debut by director Susan Montford, I look forward to seeing more of her work. The ending is great. Some have called it too ""Hollywood"" - but who cares, when Basinger gets to deliver such a cool send off, it's worth it. All in all, this a movie that at the moment seems to be having a quiet release. Don't let it put you off.

If nothing else see it for that.I think the actual story was very well done, it's a change from the stock standard 'heroine' ideal by far. Maybe thats the part many people missed. The filming of it was beautifully done and built up the atmosphere very well, though sometimes it could seem a little slow. It was successful at being decently creepy without going too far.The costumes are great and subtly manage to change the mood of the film, something not easy to pick up on but it's there if you look closely. This is a film that you need to read into, it has many, many small details that could easily get overlooked since we're used to having clues and suchlike handed to us in most other films.The character development was easy to follow, nothing seemed out of place.

I gave it 7 stars for something that I think needs mentioning: it is one of the very few movies out there to include Byzantium. Hollywood doesn't even know what that is. 'Historical' american movies know only: Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, and maybe some thing up until the fall of the Western part of the Roman Empire at the most. After that: the complete vacuum. Well, at least this movie shows a very historically rich period. I liked the scene where the Russians talk with the Romans regarding marriage arrangements, where the Roman envoy speaks Greek, as was the case back then (and they're correctly called Romans in the movie, thus avoiding the anachronism typical of almost all English-speaking historical movies).

105764,"My quick rating 6,9/10. If you are a fan of quality camera-work, editing and an array of interesting characters, this one will do well for you. In a strange film noir mix with modern times (which sometimes works and other times just seems out of place) a couple, one who conveniently is a cop, are attempting to sell a house where a brutal massacre occurs. Jessica Lowndes plays a real estate agent who conveniently is married to Joe Anderson as they start to realize that this murder was not just a one time thing when the house sells almost immediately and upon inspection, the entire crime scene has been removed, literally. Upon this strange occurrence they soon find that this has been happened before, numerous times. What befalls them is a strange tale that draws the viewer in to see who or what is taking physical murder scenes and collecting them. Behind it all is Dayton Callie, playing Jebediah Crone brilliantly, who seems to have a hold of a small town in a rather unsettling way. As the movie plays out, you start to really understand the small town mentality, and realize that you are being drawn into a much larger mystery that culminates into a wonderful ending. I won't say much more on that, just a very well made movie that aside from the strange 50s meets today style hits the mark on many levels.

105942,"Review by DJ:I hate Michael Bay's Transformers franchise. I made many points as to why they are lowest common denominator fodder and a tried and true example of bad film-making alone. But to be honest, I hated it mainly because it was a tactical strike to my nostalgia. I am an 80s baby. Transformers, G.I. Joe, Thundercats, TMNT, He-Man, Voltron, M.A.S.K., DuckTales, TaleSpin, Rescue Rangers, Silverhawks, Gobots, Heathcliff, Centurions, Dino-Riders, Danger Mouse, Count Duckula, and many more shows practically raised me. Yes, looking back at them now, I can see they were cheesy. However, I still love them because they spoke to me. They spoke to ""A"" me that I wasn't fully aware of at the time. They filled in the gaps of love and companionship my family left me to fill when they were not around. They developed my entertainment pallet. They developed my right and wrong meter. They are virtually time portals to my childhood. And if they stayed that way I would be happy with that. So, if you are going to remake them...if you're going to bring them back to modern day...changing things...changing their DNA to shoehorn them into modern sensibilities...it literally hurts me. I bring up Bay here because of the financial success of his Bayformers, other studios followed suit seeing as the almighty dollar is their guiding light. Stephen Sommers (A director I can't believe I used to like) fired another Trident missile into my memories when he brought G.I. Joe to the the big screen. It was almost as if he was copying off of Bay's test in school. It was predictable, trite, comically bad entertainment. Then, it was announced that a sequel was on the horizon and it would be directed by the guy who did the Step Up films and Justin Bieber's Never Say Never. I felt like Dustin Hoffman in Outbreak. However, after seeing G.I. Joe: Retaliation I'm relieved to say that it is much BETTER than I expected. So to say it is BETTER isn't saying that it is a great film. It still has logic problems and cheesy moments and lackluster effects. But it more effectively fits the tone a G.I. Joe film should have and offer up enough fan service an old school Joe fan would want in order to be able to walk out of the theater under their own power.Let's compare apples to apples; The Expendables works because it acknowledges the performers' nostalgic roots. It gives the fans of these performers what they want. You want Arnold to say 'I'll be back'? Fine. You want someone to say yippee ki yah? There you go. You want a Van Damme spin kick? You want a bloody, bullet riddled, fire fight for ten straight minutes? We'll give you twenty. It isn't complicated to make films that are based purely on nostalgia like Transformers and G.I. Joe. This isn't The Master or Tree of Life. Keep its simple and give the people what they want. Popcorn films like these have longer legs that way. Ask Joss Whedon. Yes, Transformers made money. A crazy amount of money. But does anyone...ANYONE hold it in high regard?G.I. Joe: Retaliation is burdened by cleaning out the closet of the previous film's story-line. A terrorist group called Cobra have an operative impersonating The President and reeking havoc on the Joes and the world. A team of surviving Joes must clear their names and take down Cobra before its too late. Simple. Director Jon M. Chu seemed to have done his research on what failed in the first film and done research on the material in general. It shows in the little nuances Joe fans would notice. A faceplate for Cobra Commander, an Uzi for Snake Eyes, an Australian accent for Firefly, a blindfold for Jinx. Its those little things that show me he actually cares about the material and doesn't just want to use the property as a bridge to show off his directorial talent. It comes across that the Joes in this film seem to actually be capable soldiers with varying skills, the way the show was intended. That as apposed to the bumbling, excelerator suit wearing, dummies in the previous film. Men and women who seemed to be working for Maxwell Smart instead of the United States Armed Services.Dwayne Johnson takes the lead in this and does an solid job. Much BETTER than the laughable Marlon Wayans and the cameoing Channing Tatum. The one thing that I thought the first G.I. Joe film got right was Ray Park's Snake Eyes. Though, Sommers even tried to screw him up too by putting a mouth on a masked man who DOESN'T TALK. But I digress. He is the only thankful carry over from the first film. His action scenes with rival Storm Shadow are worth the price of admission alone. Bruce Willis is trying much more in this than he did in his own tent pole franchise and I really liked Adrianne Palicki's Lady Jaye. However, the performances aren't all roses. Jonathan Pryce is still a bit over the top as the faux President/Zartan. The ball was dropped by casting the wooden D.J. Cotrona as Flint. A character who is supposed to be the more charismatic version of Duke merely slinks by unnoticed and unremarkably through this film. And I'm not even going to get into how bad RZA is as Blind Master. I think it is the overall camaraderie of both teams that allow you to be able to dismiss the bad apples.",positive,movie
106158,"I enjoyed the hell out of this film. It had me constantly engaged and interested in the story. I like the conflict between the characters, but glad they didn't make it dramatic. My biggest problem is there are such big ideas in this movie, they needed more time to develop some of them. A few scenes here to flesh out the conflict more. I am pretty sure they didn't do it because they have to follow the currently trend right now, mindless action set pieces with very little story. I appreciate the writers and director trying to accomplish something bigger, but there were still some missing parts. I still enjoyed the movie a lot and appreciate the effort.",positive,movie
106277,"The Ring 2 isn't as bad as some people say it is, the plot is a little more simple than the first one and I admit that there are a few places in the movie that could've been better, but it's still a good movie. I like how the movie starts off in a similar way to the first film, since it gives the feeling of deja vu. After that there are some things that are a little to much like the first but they can be ignored with little effort. The story starts out really well as I said the plot is kind of simple but its set out so that it takes a while to see the whole picture. There are some parts with CGI effects that aren't needed and that will annoy some people but thankfully, there's not to many of those. Half way through it gets really good, you don't know whats happening and you don't know how they're going to stop it all you know is that Samara has come back but with unknown intentions. After that it gets a bit obvious and kinda hurried but who cares. To sum it all up I'd have to say it done quite well since the first film was hard to follow up on. See the film for your self, trust me, you won't regret it.",positive,movie
106423,"I went into this movie tonight not expecting much based on the HORRIBLE reviews given to this movie on IMDb and critics reviews in today's paper. I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be another sweet movie about two male buddies that are learning to grow up. Owen Wilson was adorable and his character was not a loser. Dupree (I won't give away his real name because it surprises you when it comes up in the movie...) gives sage advice throughout the movie. In one scene is he standing in for Matt Dillon's character at a career day, in Molly's (Kate Hudson) 3-4? grade classroom. He tells the kids that some of them will go on to traditional or socially acceptable success, while some of them (pods, he calls them!) will ""float"" for a while, while they wait for the calling from the ""mother ship"" for their destined path in life. He says ""the pods that needed to hear this, did,"" and I laughed my butt off. His ""floating pod"" theory was hysterical and very accurate.It sounds ridiculous, but it isn't. Dupree's character is consistent throughout as a lovable guy looking for his path. He's a smart, charismatic guy that makes lots of mistakes along the way. Of course the previews showed all the stupid humor (bathroom jokes, jacking off, etc) but it doesn't play as crazily over the top in the movie as it is edited for in previews. I think the movie was as fun as it was because of the great casting. No one else could have been Michael Douglas' character (besides perhaps James Caan but he might have been too scary) and NO ONE could have done Dupree like Owen Wilson, because Dupree IS Owen Wilson. If you're like me and you like Owen Wilson movies, you'll really enjoy this movie.PS: There is a (hush hush) cameo in this movie when you least expect it and you'll laugh.",positive,movie

The plot is I like, because it is really keeps me thinking. What I don't like is the 1 hour and 35 minutes long running time and it is very long.

It is a pretty good thriller, once you get used to the fact that that is what you are watching. The storyline, basically that horrible things have happened and we the audience have to figure it out along with the main character, is not the tired thriller standard, or at least the details are different enough to not seem tired. It's actually intriguing and the answer to the mystery is not obvious miles out, even if the climax sort of is. The acting is really quite good too.

Somehow along the way, generations who follow the latter will falter just like the predecessor.Chow Yun-Fat, whom I remember from ""The Replacement Killers"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and others has really put on a show in this movie. I liked everything his character did to mentor the street kid. Seann William Scott and Jaime King were great as well. Their fighting skills are not bad at all. It's a surprise that they became ""bulletproof"" as well.This movie was just as believable as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but the results are not hard to spot in either.

107148,"Baby Mama was pretty good for the most part. It wasn't very original but pretty fun to watch. Pretty much all of the funny scenes were in the trailer. There were some other funny parts but none that really got you to laugh loud. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler did a great job together. They were very funny and Amy Poehler did a good job acting like a stupid adult. She seems like any movie with her in it are always funnier. She sometimes does get annoying in this and gets on your nerves. I don't think that this will be near the top funniest movies of 2008. It doesn't need to be though it was fun to watch especially if you are going through pregnancy. I think all sorts of people would enjoy this movie. Steve Martin was even in this movie and was very weird. This was more of a joking type of movie. Most of the funny scenes were from jokes. It was sort of boring in the beginning and was to slow moving. Then it finally picked up half way into it. It then got pretty funny and fun to see what the two ladies were going through. This movie was just like Juno, and Knocked Up, so if you liked those you will most likely like this. The characters in this movie were pretty conceded at first and selfish but then get better. Some of the messages were good. They were mostly about doing anything to get a baby if you want one. The story was pretty cliché but cute and funny. Overall this was a pretty good movie. Go see it for a pretty good time.",positive,movie
107215,"So it's no masterpiece. I wasn't expecting one. As a good ol' blood-and-guts horror/thriller, it delivers. I will say is that it's not for the faint of heart, though. This is definitely a gruesome flick, even for today's standards. I was pretty close to the edge of my seat throughout 80 % of the film--so I'd say the film did its job. And watching Sophia Bush (from ""John Tucker Must Die"") run around in short skirts and tops made the film even more fun to watch. I do have a few mild criticisms. There are some clichéd scenes, like the main characters getting arrested and being taken to one of those precincts that only exist in movies. Only about three people are on staff, making it convenient for the killer to stroll inside, murder the officers in cold blood, and track his prey. Sean Bean plays the villain/title character. Sean's a significantly talented character actor, who most people probably recognize by face, rather than by name. This could've been a much more juicy role for him, but he's not given much to do. His performance consists of sneering and delivering sadistic one-liners in a monotone. I blame this more on his character being underwritten, rather than the actor himself. He has proved in movies like ""Goldeneye"" that he's capable of playing villains with much more depth. On the other hand, character actor Neal McDonough is given a pretty juicy role as the somewhat sympathetic sheriff. ""The Hitcher"" is not a film that will go down in history, but if you want to kill an hour and 30 minutes with a kick-a** popcorn flick, it's definitely worth watching.",positive,movie
107261,"Suburbicon is a very dark comedy from the mind of director George Clooney. Clooney has a very twisted sense of humor. The gags about murder and death run rampant in the movie, yet some how we can't help but laugh at the misfortune that occurs to the characters in Suburbicon.Suburbicon is a fictitious suburban town in the late 1950's where things are slow and the worries about the traffic and the hustle of the big city are far away. Then the unthinkable happens to the members of the small community; a black family moves to town! We soon see the ""true colors"" of the people in the small community as they ban together to ""over come"" and run the professional black family out of town. Meanwhile, next door to the protesting mob, a home invasion takes place at the Gardner house (Matt Damon and Julianne Moore). Damon's wife is killed by the burglars and he and his sister-in-law pick up the pieces after the crime, along with his young son Nicky (Noah Jupe), and start a new life. But things take a twist and we find out that Damon's character is not what he appears to be to everyone in the community of Suburbicon.The movie is written by Clooney, along with the Cohen Brothers (O Brother, Where Art Thou) and is about as satirical as you can get. It drips with irony and is a social commentary film about this country, both in the 1950's and still even today. Even with it's violence and dark theme this will be a film that will be discussed at Oscar time, perhaps even as Best Movie. There is no denying the quality of the film; however, it wasn't a movie I really enjoyed. For me it was too dark and too violent. It's rated ""R"" for violence and sexual situations and runs at 1 hour and 44 minutes. There were parts of the movie that made me howl with laughter and the black family living in suburbia was another good twist on the tale, but overall the movie wasn't an enjoyable experience. My sense of decency made it hard for me to laugh at all the murders and violence in the movie. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" I rate Suburbicon a LARGE. Hollywood Hernandez",positive,movie

In the original novel, written by Ted Lewis, it was Michael Caine who was the unstoppable, revenge filled Gangster out to discover who killed his brother. In this updated version directed by Stephen Kay, we have Sylvester Stallone playing Jack Carter. Both versions were very well conceived. The updated film has added the blood, gore and non-stop drama which is common with newer versions. The story remains the same in that Carter (Stallone) learns his younger brother died under suspicious circumstances and he is determined to learn why. Along the way, he is met with business types who are not interested in helping Carter find the truth. To that end, John C. McGinley, Mickey Rourke and even Michael Caine get in the action.

107571,"Dragnet is one of those films from the 80s that you just love. It's laugh out loud funny, and the jokes - mainly the deadpan stuff - never get old. So many of the lines are incredibly familiar, and like films like Top Gun, Princess Bride, Dirty Dancing many people can quote you large chunks of the script. Dan Aykroyd is brilliant as the policing by numbers monologue play by the books guy; similar role to his character in Gross Pointe Blank and there's a little of the Blues Brothers in there too. His comedic genius is playing everything so straight against Tom Hanks' enjoyable over the top, very physical slapstick sort of comedy. Together they are comedy genius both against the foil of Christopher Plummer playing a rather similar bad-guy-but-charming character to a lot of his films - Pink Panther (whichever one it was), Dreamscape etc. Some of the best lines come from Harry Morgan (famed for M*A*S*H) as their Captain.Saddled together as an unlikely pair of partners in the Police Hanks and Aykroyd stumble upon a LA-wide conspiracy involving a prominent man of the church and the Police Commissioner and a group calling themselves PAGANs - people against goodness and normalcy - and there's Connie Swail (Alexandra Paul) the hapless virgin who will be sacrificed in on of the PAGAN's rituals... and Friday and Streebeck (Aykroyd and Hanks) have to get to the bottom of it. Hilarious police procedural, witty one liners, unforgettable scenes, great stunts and car chases and great performances make up this 80s remake and homage to the original 60s series. It's not aged that well and is a little clichéd in terms of 80s films but that is the charm. Love this film - it always really makes me smile.",positive,movie
107575,"What makes football great is that it is a game of opinions. It is obvious from reading some of the postings on here that some people have judged the film on whether or not they like David Beckham. Yes, he does appear in the film, but then so do a lot of the other players. Like it or not David Beckham is one of the most bankable stars in football, so it inevitable. Lets face it anyone from Arsenal (as one of the postings is from) is not going to be a Beckham fan. Anyway, as for the film, I think the makers of the film are so intent on steering the film away from the predictability of most sports films, ie player/team starts off badly, then ends up winning an hour and a half later (well you all know what happens) that it leaves out any real moments of drama or tension.

108319,"I tend to be curious every time a talented filmmaker gets to direct a film set in a pessimistic future/post-apocalyptic era : visually, it's the perfect setting for desolated landscapes and amazing images of urban chaos ; story-wise, it's the perfect occasion to insert social commentary and establish more or less subtle metaphors about our current way of life, our current values, and extend in a fictitious way many assumptions that we have regarding the fate of mankind and our very own planet. In my opinion, it has to be one of science-fiction's most important sub-genres, since it leaves so much room to contemporary concerns (the environment, pollution, wars, immigration, etc.). Films like ""Children of Men"", ""Looper"", and ""The Road"" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : ""Children of Men"" was an ode to life, ""Looper"" felt a lot like a modern-day western, ""The Road"" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, ""Elysium"", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with ""District 9"", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.""Elysium"" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.The first third of ""Elysium"" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in ""District 9"". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.Unfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in ""District 9"", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in ""Elysium"". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.Then the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.Overall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while ""Elysium"" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of ""Elysium"", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package.",positive,movie
108367,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is an obvious (and proud of it) homage to the great teen films of John Hughes. It is updated for this generation of teens - replete with FaceBook, texting and webcam. While this one may not have the fully realized characters of the Hughes films, it actually takes things a step further in its commentary on many topics: family life, parenting, religious zealotry, rumor-mongering and the public education system.Writer Bert V. Royal's script delivers an intellectual and comedic look into high school life ... told through the eyes of the smart, ""invisible"" girl. Just a brief overview will be offered here so as not to take away from the multiple layers.Emma Stone (""Zombieland"", ""The House Bunny"") delivers a star-making performance as Olive. Forced into a faux-confession by her best friend, Olive experiences the efficiencies of digital gossip spreading as word leaks regarding the apparent loss of her ""V card"". Even though this one is based in Ojai, California, it's nice to know that high school promiscuity is still met with a certain stigma. Here that stigma is compared to Hawthorne's expert novel, The Scarlet Letter.This sets into action a series of unforeseen events. The school's religious nuts, led by Amanda Bynes, take Olive's situation as a personal affront and spend a great deal of effort trying to punish her for her sins. At the same time, the geeks and dweebs view Olive as their savior and proceed to take advantage of the opportunity.While she is presented as a very sharp-witted, well-grounded teenager, Olive experiences the enormous power of a reputation. All of this is balanced out by her extraordinary relationship with her free-spirited, yet wise parents played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci.I can't possibly do justice to the script or the numerous topics broached, but I will say that it's a welcome new approach to teen movies. The usual schlock sex is replaced by sharp quips and real pressures. Do note that the dialogue is filled with much harsh language that wouldn't be welcome in an environment other than a high school campus. Further support work is offered by Penn Badgley as the good guy, Thomas Haden Church as a new world cool teacher, Malcolm McDowell as an old school principal and Lisa Kudrow as a guidance counselor (in a role that gives me permission to feel the disgust I usually feel when she is on screen).Don't be scared off thinking this is another lousy teen flick.

I saw it its opening weekend in theaters, and **THIS WAS IN PREVIEWS, SO I Don't CONSIDER IT A SPOILER** I see a man strapped to a chair, with this ""Man in the Iron Mask""-like thing on with all sorts of pretty nails poking toward his face. If you've seen the first one, you can expect what it does. A TV turns on, and there's the puppet thing, and that creepy voice. I'm like ""Hell yes!"" and it seemed like a great beginning, and it truly does have a great idea going for it, but unfortunately it seems like they got lost in the success of the original and the new bigger budget and lost something. It became the traditional horror movie, with your typical predictable characters, and the innovation and claustrophobic feel of the original was gone. It wasn't scary, but then again I didn't think the first one was to be honest, I think they're more of a mental experience than anything. The weird acid-trip like camera shake still occurs, though thankfully less frequently, and it is like a bigger budget Saw. Think Land of the Dead. Still a Romero movie, but it didn't feel like one as much. Same thing applies here. The ending is cool for most people, but I honestly saw it coming. It gets a bit muddled, and by the end of it you really don't remember much except the very beginning and end. It's fun, and it's an interesting piece of this new Saw series, but it just doesn't seem to live up to the original for me. You watch it yourself and give it a chance.

108670,"This film screened at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. It is a reasonable well-made based-on-a-true-story film that tells the story of a group of MIT students who attempt to make a fortune counting cards in Vegas. The screenplay apparently plays pretty fast-and-loose with the version told in the book. Never-the-less, the acting is excellent - especially Jim Sturgess in the role of the lead student. Honestly, his accent was so good that I didn't realize - until he came on stage afterward - that he was British. He does a great job with the mannerisms to give you a real sense of the character's evolution. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are solid - although Fishburne's role is fairly small. The minor characters are not as well-developed as they could have been. The cinematography of both Boston and Las Vegas is quite good, especially on the big screen.

108718,"Austin Powers is one of those movies that has become MORE popular as time wears on. Austin's slang has worked its way into the lexicon and everything from the redhot video to the Austin Powers Penis Enlarger is on sale and raking in meeeeeelions. When news of a sequel hit the streets, fans freaked. It's safe to say that AP2 is rivaled only by The Phantom Menace as 1999's must see.The wait is over.The second-most anticipated movie of 1999 finally comes to theaters. We're ecstatic to report that AP is a friggin' laugh riot, as Myers and crew have strung together another brilliant collection of one-liners and over the top, sometimes horribly disgusting, sight gags. The follow-up to 1997's video hit has Austin heading back to the 60s to track down his mojo, stolen by one of Dr. Evil's comically evil hapless henchmen. What's mojo? A multi-colored, stringy looking mess that makes Austin irresistible to the ladies. But the plot isn't so important. This is the Austin you know and love, only this time he's even more raw and hardcore.It's clear that Myers was given a much larger budget to bring his vision to the screen after the runaway success of Austin Powers on video. The sets in Spy are much more vibrant and huge, the effects (yes, effects) are top-notch, and the pacing is completely nonstop. I had a perma-grin stuck on my face through the whole thing and will need to see it again just because the audience drowned out some lines with laughter.
Here Kitty Kitty Kitty Spy picks up with Austin taking a trip in a time machine back to the smashing 60s where, as we all know, he is a sexual dynamo. The time travel bits can get confusing, but as Basil Exposition of British Intelligence says, ""Just sit back and enjoy yourself."" Back in the 60s, Austin quickly draws the attention of his nemesis Dr. Evil. The hilarity begins as a patchwork parade of moronic henchmen attempt to wipe out Austin.Still, the best reason to shell out your cash is that AP2 is clearly Dr. Evil's movie. If he's your favorite, you're in luck. Most important, we see him get some.
The film does lean a bit too heavily on gags from the first flick and some of the ""Yeah, baby"" schtick grows old fast. (When your Mammy starts saying ""Yeah, baby,"" it's clearly tired, right?) Still, fans of the original will feel right at home with the budget destructo devices, the horrid teeth, and the clumsy bumblings of Austin himself.

108851,"So, here we are then with the third installment of the American Pie series. The first one was a refreshing take on the teen comedy. I'm not a massive fan of the genre, but thanks to good writing and interesting characters, the film worked. The second one was more of the same, but in spite of that it still managed to be entertaining enough to be considered 'good'. This third part again can be considered 'more of the same', except this time there's a wedding theme and, thankfully, the writers have isolated the dead wood from the other two films and dropped it. The dumb jock, Mena Suvari (good actress, crap character), Kevin's girlfriend...you get the point, have been dropped. This leaves us to concentrate on the more interesting characters - Jim, obviously but more notably Stifler, Finch and Jim's dad; who are the real stars of the series anyway. As usual, they're the ones that are relied on to bring in the laughs, and they do it to the standard that you'd expect. None of them are quite as funny as they have been and Stifler's character seems to have become more outrageous, rather than keeping in with what's gone before...but who cares in a film like this? Character coherency isn't too much of an issue anyway.The central theme of the wedding is how most of the jokes come about, and it creates four big set-pieces; two of which work, and two of which don't. Seeing Stifler dancing in a gay bar is hilarious and sure to delight everyone that sees the film, but even funnier than that is the part where Stifler hires two exotic dancers to 'entertain' the boys...at the same time that Jim has invited Michele's parents round for a 'chat'...oops! The two that don't work are more disgusting than funny...and I'm sure you'll see which parts I mean upon seeing the movie. As you might expect from the conclusion (hopefully!) of a series and one that sees two of it's characters tie the knot, there's a degree of sentiment here; but it does work, and it's even kind of nice to see after watching the characters 'develop' (somewhat, anyway) over the last two films.American Wedding is a decent comedy, and one that I would recommend to anyone that liked the other two films.",positive,movie

There are really only two places for the story to go -- Jodie's crazy or she's the victim of a Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy -- and it doesn't take a seasoned film critic to figure out which direction this one is headed. But while FLIGHTPLAN offers just a few mild surprises, it does so with a fair degree of tension and passion on Foster's part (she's settled into the role of hysterical mother a little too comfortably). The cast features several fine actors who you could say are slumming or more agreeably characterize as giving their all to a serviceable mainstream thriller.

I watched this movie alone in the dark at midnight, with my DTS surround sound speakers, and it scared the HELL out of me! This movie intends to makes you feel damp, filthy and frightening. It takes itself very seriously, no jokes. The horror is non-stop, not allowing you to take a break. The fright and the gore satisfies most horror fans. Good style, good cinematography, well-directed.

109629,"A group of six young people find themselves stranded in the mountains of West Virginia. When four members of the group leave to find either help or a phone they stumble upon a cabin that at first appears to be deserted. But what they find in the cabin proves that it is actually inhabited and not the place they want to be when the owners return home. Just as they are making their exit, a truck pulls to the front of the house and three inbred mountain men enter the house carrying the dead, butchered bodies of their friends with them.What Works: Inbred Hillbillies. Movies with backwoods murderous inbred hillbillies have always fascinated me. Some of my favorite movies (The Hills Have Eyes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Final Terror, etc.) feature this kind of character. These characters are frightening because you know they're based in reality. There really are people out there who look and, to a lesser extent, act like this. As a bonus, the make-up used on Three Finger, Saw-Tooth, and One-Eye is excellent. It's another argument in favor of traditional quality latex make-up.No Jokes. Other than a few bits of comedy that fit within the framework of the plot, Wrong Turn is played straight. Most movies made today with this many horror clichés would turn into one big self-referential jokefest. I'm glad Schmidt avoided going down this road. There is no attempt to go out of the way to create comedy or fill the movie with inappropriate one-liners that only serve to ruin mood and atmosphere.Scenes of Violence. I found many of the scenes of violence particularly well done. These inbred hillbillies are brutal and savage. They care not for human life. Their methods of killing are primitive but effective. One of my favorite scenes involves a bow, an arrow, and human eye. Nice! What Doesn't Work: It's Not West Virginia. My wife is from West Virginia and I've been there any number of times. I could tell almost immediately that the film wasn't actually made in West Virginia. I wasn't surprised to discover that the actual location was Ontario, Canada. If you're going to film a movie that is set in West Virginia, why not film it in West Virginia? This just bugged me throughout the entire movie.Why doesn't Eliza die? With the exception of Eliza Dushku's character, every other victim the inbreeds run across is immediately slaughtered. So why did they (or better yet, why does the script) treat Eliza differently? Why is she spared long enough to be rescued? Obviously I know the answer, but it's an inconsistency in Wrong Turn that I didn't appreciate.Wrong Turn is a nice throwback to the 70s movies I grew up with. It's vicious, raw, brutal, and a lot of fun. In short, it's my kind of horror movie. Just thinking about the movie should make my family's annual October camping trip to West Virginia a more interesting.",positive,movie

From the day I saw it as a 17-year-old in January 1998 I always found it entertaining and exciting. This might be down to the fact that I have never seen the 1973 original.Brucie plays a nameless assassin, cool as ice and utterly emotionless. Richard Gere is the only man to have seen him. He's let out of prison to assist the FBI in catching the Jackal before he takes out an uncertain high-ranking official. Willis and Gere are, for the most part, leading their own movies as they never meet until the climax. It's very interesting watching them both go about their business, Willis hatching a master plan and Gere methodically picking apart his trail and hunting him down. There is great support from Sidney Poitier and cutie-pie Diane Venora as a scarred Russian cop.With a wide variety of brilliantly photographed locations across the US and Canada, and plot with a medium-level of complexity it's not entirely brainless viewing but not too taxing as to alienate lazy viewers. I honestly do not get why so many people hate it. Willis has done far worse films (even seen Mercury Rising?) that get off scot-free somehow, but The Jackal doesn't get off so lightly. Aside from Gere's slightly dodgy Oirish accent I have no complaints about this film. Give it a chance and you might just be entertained.",positive,movie

However, as events roll on, it becomes clear there may be more to his illness than meets the eye. Especially in relation to his stuck-in-her-ways wife (Gena Rowlands) and the use of Voodoo and the history of the creaky old house they live in, including the room 'no one can go inside...' In amongst some effective jump scenes, The Skeleton Key also has a lot of depth and development to offer in terms of the story. But this is really a blessing and a curse, because on the one hand it makes the story more involving but on the other it kind of makes it drag on a bit in parts and this makes the film a little boring, especially towards the end. Performances wise, there's good work from Hudson in the lead, as well as the support from Rowlands and Hurt, saying practically nothing in one of the most crucial roles in the film. Not the best horror film you'll ever see but definitely not the worst and a great stepping stone for Hudson to proceed on her journey into the A list of Hollywood stars. ***",positive,movie

109731,"We begin by meeting a security guard running for his life into a locker room. He looks in a large mirror and his reflection cuts it's throat. The security guard collapses bleeding from a real neck wound.Next we meet Kiefer Sutherland as he starts his first day of work in a large mall that looks like castle/federal museum with giant ceilings and Greek columns. The mall burnt and is currently vacant only occupied by some leftovers from the stores mainly mannequins, furniture, and huge mirrors. The mirrors are squeaky clean. We are told the Kiefer's predecessor obsessed about keeping them clean.The life of Kiefer's character is a mess. Out of a job from the police department, divorced and in trouble with his lovely wife over the two kids, sleeping on his lovely sister's couch and apparently with some type of a prescription drug problem. On his rounds at his new job he discovers something odd. A hand print on a mirror. The print can't be removed. It's on the other side of the mirror. He also discovers a flooded basement. Back at home he starts seeing things in the mirror. And starts investigating things about the place and the security guard who he replaced. He suspects that it is not just in his head as others tell him but that something is not right with this building and the mirrors.It turns out next to the mall was a hospital where strange treatments took place in the psychiatric unit. As a result of what happened there to a young girl, the mirrors in the mall are trying to convey a message. Kiefer continues with the investigation tracking down the girl. In the meantime the mirrors start attacking his loved ones.There are a couple of twists near the end. The story takes on quite a different character from the mirror-attacking-people story. Also the end is a neat surprise. Unusual ending and very interesting.Aja knows how to direct horror and actors. And this movie is nicely photographed and has great camera work. There are some good scares and gore scenes. And the story itself is good. The only problem I found is that it's too long at nearly two hours and could have used a re-editing for tightness. The mirrors are as much as a character as Kiefer, who himself is not a very approachable guy in this movie. Overall a watchable milder horror film that could use either more horror or deletion of scenes to make it tighter more action-packed.",positive,movie
109773,"I think I should state this upfront that this is a Kids and Family movie and hence a lot of grownups might not really enjoy it that much. That said, the audience it is meant for, Kids and Families will definitely find this movie, time well spent. The Plot is slightly cliché and fairly simple, Movie starts with an eccentric father, who spends most of his time chasing elusive forest creatures and in the process neglecting family and hence there is a communication gap between father and daughter. The movies go on to solve that problem and of course it involves an adventure! The Adventure is a typical Good vs. Evil, balance in the nature, a vagabond hero, a patronizing mentor, a precious Item that must be saved and tricky condition that must be fulfilled,As Cliché as it could possibly be. But when did I ever say that Plot was the selling point or the high point of the movie, It's the visuals, the great use of 3D( not exceptional, but some minor details have been well taken care of, specially the grass, leaves etc in the forest), some great chase scenes, Parades and a really imaginative representation of a mystical universe. Dubbing was pretty good actually specially Beyonce as queen Tara, Colin Farrel as Ronin and Aziz as the fatter slug ( some of the wittiest and really funny dialogs). The animation was top notch and you could see the similarities with Reo and Ice Age. So the final verdict is this movie is a 6.5 on 10 in general and a 8 on 10 for families and kids ( one kid in the theater was actually cheering for the good guys towards the end!)

110043,"This is definitely the first time I have gone to see an Russell Crowe and/or Ridley Scott film at the cinema, fully bracing myself to be disappointed and...I am very pleased to be able to say that I enjoyed it thoroughly. It has a very warming glow to it - beautifully played; gorgeously shot. Anyone who isn't just a little bit seduced by Provence after seeing it needs their head (or more likely their heart) examining. The lessons may well have been taught in a hundred films before, but that doesn't make them any less relevant or resonant for the commercial era in which many of us now live...So, why the terrible reviews? I really don't know. The comedy was not overplayed in the way implied by the critics at all. To be blunt, it was not really necessary, as the warmth and effectiveness of the film and story lies in the romantic drama. The comedy is fine, but doesn't really add anything to the film. However, it does give it a very upbeat, cheerful and likable feel and maybe that is reason enough.Max's character and Russell Crowe's performance? It's in the quieter moments where Crowe really excels and shows just why someone would want to cast him, as opposed to say Hugh Grant, in a film like this. His reactions to memories and the things that other characters do and say are just so much deeper and more real than Grant is capable of: which is why Grant always comes off as the same character in these films (a variation on the Grant formula) and Max comes off as real.It almost seems as though the critics have a film with this plot pegged into a box: because they can only see (and can only expect to see) a Hugh Grant characterisation, they cannot accept anything other than a Hugh Grant characterisation. Whereas the actual reason that Crowe doesn't come off as Hugh Grant is because he isn't channelling that kind of characterisation at all. This is a very different kind of film.Also, the critics seem to be completely off the mark in assessing the character, when they say that he starts off a bastard and ends a bastard too. Actually, this is far more about unearthing other qualities - not completely rejecting those 'bastard' qualities that he begins the film with, but refining and diluting them, as he becomes more and more adjusted to his past. He doesn't change, he opens his heart and mind to qualities that he has been ignoring within himself. You can see that other Max from the moment he opens the letter telling him Henry is dead - but he tries to resist the feelings that are clearly there, in large part because he doesn't want to face the fact that he has let his Uncle down - and all of the guilt that is allied with that.The film is not the best film I have ever seen. The questions it asks are fairly fundamental, but they aren't startling or especially thought provoking.But the film is highly enjoyable, from start to finish; and it's warm, something that is pretty rare in films these days.So, to end, clearly I am not in tune with the critics - but then, increasingly that seems to be the case nowadays. I just think that I see completely different films to them...",positive,movie
110133,"A stoner - who is in fact a government agent - is marked as a liability and targeted for extermination. But he's too well-trained and too high for them to handle.American Ultra is a late-summer business for a good-time-seeking young audiences. Those who saw director Nima Nourizadeh's moderately successful first feature, comedy Project X, will have an idea of the excess to expect here. It's a very mid- August sort of film, the kind that benefits from low. The first 20 minutes or so are pretty fun and provokes a few laughs by identifying multiple symptom of our generation. The script by Max Landis (Chronicle) delivers more of a big mess than anything coherent or genuinely engaging. Moreover, characters are fun. Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart are a sort of Bonnie and Clyde with a water bong. Unfortunately both of them, frequently great, are unsure footing here. They smoke, say ""like"" and the F-word a lot and eventually kick plenty of butt in a way that looks pretty good. Their relationship is revealed to have a history and dynamic that goes much deeper. However, the only aspect of Jesse Eisenberg character that feels genuine is his paranoia, which within the auspices of comedic action movie, is totally earned. Plus, some people come across as larger than life on screen but Eisenberg and Stewart really don't. There are some highly entertaining cameos. The action sequences build in size throughout the movie. There's chasing, fighting, hiding and urgent phone calls. All of what is nicely edited, big slo-motion shoots down come together in slick and engaging ways. This time around director has thankfully moderated her shaky- cam tendencies. Still, sensation is sensation, amusing discussions, witty characterisation and creative violence. Finally the most creative and witty part of the entire film may well be the animated and credits, which have a panache mostly absent from what's come before. I actually had fun with this movie though. The film doesn't aim for much but guess what? It's nor award season but the last weeks of summer.

He gives a hint to the police through a sketch of the killer's face, and is protected by Illeana and the Canadian team force against any revenge of the assassin. ""Taking Lives"" is a very reasonable thriller, having many plot points, but being predictable with no innovations, and very similar to ""Seven"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Bone Collector"", ""Resurrection"" and other ""tales"" of serial killers. There is a great manipulation of the viewer with one specific scene, when Illeana returns to Washington and which was also included in the deleted scenes (only with more details), but the last twist saves the movie. Further, the character of Illeana is overrated as a special agent sent to another country, being very fragile in many moments. Although having this great flaw in the script, the cast is excellent and the story is not bad, and in the end it is a good entertainment. The soundtrack of Phillip Glass, with the beautiful song ""Bad"" of the U2, is another good attraction. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Roubando Vidas"" (""Stealing Lives"")",positive,movie
110258,"Greetings again from the darkness. So Close. This is painfully close to being a great film. Although still very good at presenting issues normally not seen on film, director Gore Verbinski (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ""The Ring"") falls just short of making a very powerful statement.Please do not let the trailer fool you. This is not slapstick comedy like ""Anchorman"". This is deep, often dark subject matter addressing the emotional struggles men face when dealing with a bad divorce, trying to maintain a relationship with kids, and the pressures of trying to make one's own dad proud (or at least gain acceptance). So often Hollywood deals with the plight of the woman and her emotional turmoil. Instead we are ""treated"" with watching a man's attempt to live up to (what he thinks are) expectations of others and how somehow the right job will make everything OK ... his life will be whole.Nicolas Cage gives another outstanding performance as ""The Weather Man"" on a Chicago TV station. To add to the complexity, he is not a meteorologist and he is being courted by a national morning talk show featuring Bryant Gumbel. Two areas with this character are poorly written in my opinion. First, Cage's hair weave is bloody awful. At least in Dallas, weather men all look like Televangelists with perfect hair. His is always askew ... don't they have hair/make-up staff in Chicago? Second, the character is written as too much of a loser in all aspects. He is not just struggling, he is not someone any guy or girl would want to hang with. The film tries, but fails, to show the ""switch"" come on when Cage steps in front of the camera. They tell us this happens, but it needed to be presented much clearer.Playing Cage's father, Michael Caine is a pretty intimidating figure as he is confused about his son's direction in life while at the same time facing a very dark future of his own. Caine is wonderful in the role and when he tells his son ""Sometimes in life, you just have to chuck it"", we really get it and hope that Cage does as well.On the other hand, Hope Davis is cast as yet another frigid ""B"" yuppie whom I don't understand how any man could be attracted to. Yet somehow this is the woman Cage wants back. Time to stretch your talent a bit Hope. You showed plenty of promise in ""About Schmidt"" and have been working steadily since. But to take the next step as an actress, you need to try a new character. Gil Bellows (""Aly McBeal"") has a creepy role as Cage's teenage son's counselor. He is responsible for some of the most uncomfortable moments as well as a way for Cage to finally cut loose.As I said, this is a very good movie that falls just short of greatness. While providing insight into the male psyche, it fails to deliver the message or solution it seemed to be leading up to. However, it is nice to see a man portrayed as something other than a superhero, adulterer, international spy or Olympic caliber lover.",positive,movie

Once again, Vince Vaughn is back with his likable man-child persona again for this remake about fatherhood and family.

110631,"Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others', directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar (Abre los Ojos) is a stylish, spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the mother of two small children, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) and Anne (Alakina Mann) who are allergic to the sunlight, so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover, any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut, a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously, the mansion's staff left the week before, which precipitates the arrival of three new servants; a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child, and unexplained footsteps, opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uber-fragile Grace, until the occurrences threaten their lives.With 'The Others', Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. Kidman is great as the incredibly brittle and mentally frayed Grace. While she puts on a cool, haughty façade, the circumstances she finds herself in are clearly eating away at her sanity. The actors who play her children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent. 'The Others' is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. 'The Others' takes its time to get to its reveal, and it is worth every minute. 7/10Shelly",positive,movie

He takes up the case of a man who is accused of molesting a child, thinking that he is innocent. Midway through the case, Lomax discovers that the man is in fact guilty and though he is a little disturbed, he helps secure the man's acquittal.

The old original Star Trek movies had well defined relationship stories in them but in this, it seems like the characters are secondary to the graphic presentations and fighting scenes.

I expected to see some spark of something that made him attractive to these fabulous women (he wasn't rich at 30), but I didn't see it. What exactly did Delpy and Lolita girl (and even the flower girl at the cemetery) see in him at 50? I first thought maybe the references to Don Juan and Don Johnson were supposed to gentle put downs against a guy that obviously did not fit the bill.

Most of ""Mean Streets"" is slightly unfocused with a simplistic plot based around a lot of machismo grandstanding and long bouts of boring dialog (occasionally made interesting by DeNiro's off-kilter star-making turn as Johnny-Boy), with spats of visceral violence (far less gory here than in later Scorcese pics), and a visual bravado that seems slightly less disciplined but no less entertaining than your standard Scorsese crime flick.Despite its drawbacks (mainly due to youth and inexperience), the template was set. The opening credits (done to the tune of ""Be My Baby"") suck you right into the film, and the rest of the movie is peppered with Scorsese's loving treatment of popular music that would later become one of his most endearing hallmarks. The basic premise featuring Harvey Keitel as Charlie (the young hood with a heart of gold and conflicted internally by the religion of the Church and the religion of the Streets), Robert DeNiro as Johnny-Boy (the equally loved and hated loose-canon brother figure), and Amy Robinson as Theresa (the woman our hero wants to put on a pedestal as a saint but often treats like a whore), is a trifecta of archetypes we see repeated again and again in Scorsese's films (most obviously in ""Casino"" with the DeNiro-Pesci-Stone characters, and most subversively in ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" with Jesus-Judas-Mary Magdalene). The religious iconography, the brotherhood of crooks, the attraction to the gangster lifestyle, the keen eye for depicting violence in artistic and startling ways...these are displayed here in ""Mean Streets"" in their rawest form.Though flawed in many ways, ""Mean Streets"" set the stage and laid the the template for the type of film Scorsese would perfect seventeen years later with ""Goodfellas."" This heralded the arrival of a new talent and a new genre, and the world of film has thankfully never been the same.",positive,movie
111419,"I'm afraid I'm a bit confused. I saw ""Inception"" last night. I had high expectations based on miles of positive ink from reviewers and professional critics, all tripping over themselves to bestow demigod status upon Christopher Nolan. These expectations were dashed to bits within the first thirty minutes of the film, and turned to a kind of dread as I realized what folks these days will accept as ""depth"" in their entertainment. I wish I'd never seen those gushing reviews, I would've enjoyed the film much more. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight."" For my money, those were without a doubt the second and third most effective superhero movies to date (sorry, Raimi wins.) The man certainly knows how to keep a story moving along, and he knows how to film action. In the case of The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger provided an emotional lynchpin non-pareil in his Joker portrait, and Nolan milked it for all it was worth. There was real pathos and genuine mortal horror built into the foundation of the film's impressive structure. Also, the fact that it was based on a comic book lowered the bar and allowed the audience to suspend just enough disbelief to allow most of the dorky plot elements to slip through and do their work. Now let's discuss obvious comparisons to an earlier effort in this vein—that is, an action movie dolled up to the nines as philosophical treatise. I'll admit that I was never a fan of The Matrix. I thought it was asinine in conception and brutish in execution, even as I admired some of the visual effects and spectacular stunt work. Comparing The Matrix's ridiculous endless ""stream-of-consciousness"" gibberish about free will with, say, Roy Batty's laconic final soliloquy in Blade Runner, is like comparing the Twilight series' moronic teen romantic angst with David Foster Wallace. Unfortunately, Inception had precisely the same effect on me, which is to say very little. Here we find the great and terrible Nolan exploring the tired territory already plundered in countless films of yore, including Hitchcock's Spellbound and 1980's genre pics such as Brain Storm, The Dead Zone, and Dreamscape. The basic premise reads like a dime store sci-fi novel's back cover: ""In the future, we can enter into each other's dreams! Feel the magic of dreams, within dreams, within dreams! Experience the thrill and wonder of miraculous ""Dream Time."" Oh Boy!"" Within twenty minutes of the film's somewhat intriguing intro, I knew not only how it would end—I also pretty much knew how we were getting there. Nolan plays primarily to the back row, and—no offense, America—but we've been slightly dumbed down over the past few decades, and we're much easier as a whole to entertain than we used to be. Look back at a few films of the past with vast, labyrinthine plot structures like Hawk and Faulkner's ""The Big Sleep"", or practically anything by the Coen Brothers. What's defines their deep-impact gravitas, as opposed to the flat and diffuse emotional landscape of Inception? It's character development, pure and simple. In this case, Nolan didn't have a single character —especially the one played with typically earnest gusto by Leo Dicaprio—with a plausibly human fatal flaw, foible, or reason for doing uh, whatever it was he was doing. We're simply dropped into an alternate universe with rules seemingly invented to favor nerds of any stripe —almost impossibly similar to the one in The Matrix—and told to hold onto our hats, because here we go! Except we're not actually GOING anywhere, or at least not anywhere we haven't been a thousand times before. Sorry to rain on the parade of everyone that's ready to lionize C. Nolan as the great white hope of modern blockbuster cinema, but from my vantage, there is no there there. If you want a lesson in basic existential philosophy, take a class at your local community college. You'll get more out of it, and you can keep your textbook as a souvenir. If it's great car chases you're after, rent ""The French Connection,"" or ""Ronin."" In other words, keep your high-octane action movie out of my high-concept art film. These are two tastes that do not go great together. Meanwhile, if Inception somehow does ""become a religion"" in another five years, than I'm reconsidering my continued faith in Hollywood as some kind of egalitarian oracle, where the huddled masses can go to get their myths, and feel the true power of redemption. If this is the kind of movie that will be worshipped from now on, than the god of blockbuster cinema may truly be dead.",positive,movie
111480,"The first 3 seasons are excellent. I used to recommend this series to all my friends. Few episodes, good story, unique characters. Then the fame came and brought greed. History Channel decided to double the earnings by doubling the number of episodes in season 4. Without enough content to fill the episodes, the show became slow and boring. I decided to stop watching it by the end of season 4 because I realized it was declining. I don't want to screw up my good memories.",positive,movie
111482,"OK look, let me settle something between those who love and hate this film. A lot of people hail this film because it is technically brilliant and ground breaking. Director Orson Welles did a lot of things visually that no one had ever done before. Nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie. This movie also had a great impact in its time. The title character was based on media giant William Randolph Hearst. He was that generations Donald Trump. He opposed this film so much he did everything in its power to stop its release and almost succeeded. Lastly this film contains some of the strongest and most common themes in literature; Life versus death. It is for these reasons why this film is so revered.On the contrary people who hate this film mainly complain that it is boring. Which is a legitimate complaint. The story is slow compared to today's standards, and there is no real Hearst character alive today in which to relate. So yes, the story on the surface is outdated. However, this does not make it a bad movie. It was not made as a Matrix/Star Wars type of movie which can be enjoyed even at surface level. This is not pure entertainment. Remember there is more to film than storytelling. This film was designed to be cinematically beautiful and to tell a basic story of love and redemption. There is much more to the story than the thinly veiled attack on Hearst, one just needs to look deeper. Look at Shakespeare or Hawthorne for example, their literary works are universally loved. Yet, many people blow them off because they refuse to look past the outdated language into the beautiful prose and simple ubiquitous themes. Just because something is outdated does not mean it lacks worth in today's world.My advice to those who did not like it the first time or have not seen it yet is simple. Watch it again for what it is. Do not expect to be on the edge of your seat for two hours. Watch it for the cinematography that alone makes this film among the best (I don't agree with AFI's number one ranking but I think it still ranks high). Look deeper into the story and try to connect with it on some level. At the very least appreciate how influential this film was and where the industry would be without it. If you can do this, then maybe some of the naysayers will change their minds. Again, you do not have to love Citizen Kane, but at least respect it for what it is.",positive,movie
111500,"The routine use of black-and-white film to make movies seems to have ended in the mid-sixties, probably killed off by the advent of colour television. Since then black-and-white has been used very sparingly; even Polanski's `Chinatown', obviously conceived as homage to the films noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, was shot in colour.`Raging Bull'- a biography of the boxer Jake La Motta who for a time held the world middleweight championship- is one of the few exceptions. The use of black-and-white seems to have been inspired by the fact that the film depicts real-life events that occurred in the forties and fifties. Scorsese has tried to capture the look of both the films and the newsreels of that period. This is remarkably effective for the boxing scenes, which have a raw, brutal power and graphically depict the aggressive nature of the sport. The other remarkable thing about the film is the performance of Robert de Niro, for which he won a well-deserved Best Actor Academy Award. De Niro actually learned to box for the film, and did all the boxing scenes himself without using a stunt double, but his portrayal of La Motta's private life is equally effective.Some boxers- Henry Cooper comes to mind- are hard-hitting inside the ring but gentlemanly and restrained outside. La Motta, as portrayed in this film, did not fall into this category. De Niro portrays him as a man with a very short fuse, seething with anger and violence. Unlike his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson, an elegant practitioner of the art of boxing, La Motta tries to overpower his rivals with brute force rather than relying on skill. His aggression is not something confined to the ring, but rather an inherent part of his personality, and comes out in his dealings with others. He treats his beautiful wife Vicki particularly badly, frequently (and irrationally) suspecting her of infidelity and subjecting her to both verbal and physical abuse. Besides De Niro's dominating performance, there are also very good contributions from Cathy Moriarty as Vicki and from Joe Pesci as La Motta's loyal brother Joey, another frequent target of abuse despite his loyalty.For me, this is a very good film, yet one that falls just short of the classic status that some have claimed for it. At times it is enthralling to watch, but at others, particularly in the first half, it seems to lack structure, as La Motta takes on a series of opponents without the significance of these fights ever becoming clear. More could have been made of the gambling-inspired corruption that infested the sport at this period and which may well have contributed to La Motta's sense of frustration- at one time it is made clear to him that his getting a chance to fight for the world title depends upon his taking a dive in a non-title fight. The main weakness, however, is a sense of emptiness at its centre, resulting from the lack of a character who can engage our sympathies. As I said, it is De Niro's performance that dominates the film, but for all his fine acting, even he cannot make us sympathise with a drunken, self-pitying, paranoid, violent wife-beater. As a character study of an unpleasant character it is excellent, but it can go no further than that. I cannot agree that this is the greatest film of the eighties; indeed, for me it was not even the greatest sporting film of the eighties. (I preferred both `Chariots of Fire' and `Eight Men Out'). It is an easy film to admire, but a difficult one to love. 7/10.",positive,movie

I think that the first episode could have contained a lot more time letting us get to know the characters better before throwing them into battle.The battle scenes were done very well and played very realistically.

111616,"Stargate boasts some of the greatest special effects on TV for a science fiction show. The show looks beautiful and the sets are incredible. The negative about this show is the acting of Amanda Tapping and the writing. Michael Shanks is terrific as Daniel Jackson, Christopher Judge is fantastic as T'ealc and surprisingly Richard Dean Anderson is very good as O'Neil. Tapping is the weak link in this show--her acting is cardboard style and her expressions are the same each and every show. The writing is lacking big time. The writers should have looked at the work on Farscape (one of the best written shows in Sci-Fi) and Firefly (the best post-Star Trek show ever made). Each and every show (that the team goes on a ship) they are captured--each and every show Daniel or Sam allows an enemy to access data and improve themselves. It is highly annoying that a character ""supposedly"" as brilliant as Samantha Carter would continuously allow enemy characters to improve themselves by allowing them access to SG technology. No military commander would ever allow that to happen. The other big annoyance is the way each and every character is a high ranking officer. As ex-military you would NEVER EVER EVER see people of that rank on these LURP (SG) team in the field. These fields would be led by a lower officer or a sergeant. No team would have a Colonel and a Major on a four man squad. The effects are spectacular--but the writing is sub-par.",positive,movie
111724,"EDIT: Couldn't finish 3rd Season. The following is for the first two fantastic seasons. Seasons 1-2: 10. Most of Season 3: 4 (it just didn't grip me the same way the first two seasons did--felt like work).---
First, I think certain symptoms of AS are exaggerated in all movies/shows. It MIGHT be me, but I think the (1) taking things literally and (2) poor social judgment are the two most exaggerated (they're definitely VERY real, just maybe not to the extent portrayed in movies/shows-- at least, in my experience/observation, if those two are present to the extent portrayed by Hollywood, so are other concomitant symptoms of more severe autism). Don't get me started on ""The Accountant"" (puke).However, it's Hollywood, and understandable. The rest of the show is so great that I don't care about that relatively small exaggeration (which, again, might just be my own ignorance anyway). I actually kind of like it. Even if it's exaggerated, it adds an entertaining aspect to the show. And I'm not some whiny snowflake that needs to nitpick a relatively minor and understandable Hollywood embellishment because AS is ""my identity,"" which gives me some sort of soapbox to feel special about (can't stand those people!).Like I said, loved it!I care about ALL of the characters.I love, love, LOVE Michael Rapaport as the father. But they're ALL great. Seriously, even less integral characters like the bartender and boyfriend were perfect. I'm very sensitive to overacting and unjustifiable drama, and I noticed ZERO of the former, and only one small instance of the latter (possibly a not very realistic reaction by the daughter, to support a message that the writer wanted to communicate more than the circumstances justified), but it was only once, and minor.Overall, the events that unfold are justified by the circumstances (you feel as though everything that follows is an inevitable and realistic consequence of the circumstances).Also, NOT BORING. There is no fluff! No boring explanations or transitions. The writers do an EXCELLENT job of making fun and interesting things happen IMMEDIATELY. One thing, after another. Engrossing from the beginning, and it STAYS that way.All I ask to the creator, Robia Rashid, and the writers, etc, please do not get comfortable or ""satisfied."" Please do not become one of the MANY shows that has a great first season, then loses that original drive that made the first season so great. Please do not settle on anything. You made magic happen in the first season. Please maintain that same commitment to make season two magic as well.",positive,movie
111829,"It's a classic tale of love, murder and obsession, when a homicide detective becomes enamored of the victim of a brutal murder he's investigating, in `Laura,' directed by Otto Preminger and starring Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.  The story begins with the discovery of the murder of Laura Hunt (Tierney), a young advertising executive in New York City, and as detective Mark McPherson (Andrews) makes his investigation and begins to fit together the pieces of the puzzle of Laura's life and death, the essence of who she was begins to emerge.  And it gives the story an interesting twist; for after seeing a portrait of Laura, and getting to know her by reading her most intimate personal letters and diary (routine for a murder investigation), McPherson becomes obsessed with her, and soon discovers he's not alone; there was another man obsessed with her as well.  Subsequently, he must determine if that obsession played any part in Laura's death. 																										The suspects include the men in her life, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a radio personality/columnist who helped her begin her career, and Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), her fiance, a man of seemingly dubious character who had recently been involved with a model who worked for Laura's agency.  The list doesn't end with them, however; also in the running is a man named Jacoby (John Dexter), the artist who painted the portrait of Laura that so mesmerized McPherson, and then there's some question as to the relationship between a certain Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) and Carpenter that is yet to be resolved.  	Preminger delivers a solid mystery that will keep you in suspense until the very end, but with only enough tension to keep it interesting rather than engrossing.  And though the story is believable, there are elements of the plot that develop so quickly it stretches credibility a bit.  An additional two or three scenes relating to certain aspects of the characters lives (especially Laura's) would have had a significant impact of this film-- good as it is-- and with a running time of 85 minutes (on most prints) it wouldn't have been out of the question to expand it somewhat.	As far as the characters, McPherson, Lydecker and Carpenter emerge fully sketched and need little development; you know exactly who they are and where they've been.  This is not the case with Laura, however; Tierney's character suffers somewhat from lack of development, and as the story unfolds, she seems to get from here to there with little discernible change. What the character needed was a bit more depth and some real definition.	Which is exactly what Andrews and Webb give to their characters; Webb as the flamboyant and self-assured Lydecker, Andrews as the stoic and deliberating McPherson.  Price gives a notable performance, as well, but has a tendency to lapse into melodrama occasionally, which can be distracting at times.  And Tierney gives a passable performance, though her acting is not on a par with her exquisite beauty.  In her initial encounter with Lydecker, for instance, her pronounced coyness is somewhat diverting.  Still, her presence on the screen is radiant, which makes it easy to overlook the slight flaws in her acting.  	The supporting cast includes Dorothy Adams (Bessie), Cy Kendall (Inspector), Grant Mitchell (Lancaster Corey), Buster Miles (Office Boy) and Frank La Rue (Hairdresser).  A good mystery, but with few surprises, `Laura' nevertheless remains a classic in it's own right.  It's not a perfect film (the final words spoken, in fact, are decidedly melodramatic), but it's good storytelling, and is ultimately satisfying.  Saying that there was room for improvement would be nit-picking; suffice to say that it is what it is, which is a pretty good movie.  I rate this one 7/10.",positive,movie

And that of course is the point.What deserves mention is that that the writers set themselves a great task. To use backstory not merely as filler (which, by its nature, it is) but to develop anticipation for what is to come.If you think that is easy, try it yourself.Or, better yet, watch any random episode of ARROW where the writers consistently shoot themselves in the foot the moment they drag out the flashbacks.Sometimes you have to judge the achievement by the intent, not the result.When you realize what a lofty goal the writers set for themselves, you also realize that they largely succeeded.

113173,"""Blood Mania"" focuses on an unhinged heiress who murders her terminally ill father, a doctor—not to keep the money herself, but rather with the intent to help get his younger, attractive colleague (Peter Carpenter) out of fifty thousand dollars' worth of debt to an extortionist blackmailing him over his past work as a covert abortionist. Things get complicated (and violent) when the woman's sister arrives for the reading of the will.I'm not going to sit here and pretend that ""Blood Mania"" is high-brow cinema; it's many things, but it's definitely not that. However, I feel this film has taken a bit of an undeserved lashing from genre fans that it may not necessarily deserve. With a title like ""Blood Mania,"" the film inherently makes promises it doesn't necessarily deliver on, but does that mean it's the disaster the many have painted it as? I don't think so.The film, as many have noted, does play out like a sordid melodrama for much of its middle and latter half, but there is a constant sinister undertone beneath it that follows it through to the conclusion. This is largely helped by Maria De Aragon's performance as the sex-crazed, sociopathic femme fatale. Where the film does deliver is in the skin department, but it does have the distinction of being indiscriminate; for every shot of the svelte De Aragon, Vicki Green, or Reagan Wilson, there is a corresponding shot of the film's hunky lead, Carpenter, who bares just as much for the camera (and is also as morally corrupt as De Aragon).Sex and soap opera aside, what I found especially fascinating about the film was its psychotronic and truly commendable cinematography, something one rarely expects out of a film like this. It opens with a hallucinatory sequence of a woman running through the darkness, stalling in freeze frames lit with various colors, which invoke Mario Bava and predate Dario Argento at his height. The film is colorful and richly detailed in terms of visuals, and the mansion setting is true California Gothic at its finest. The writing itself is actually not half-bad either; there is a bit of stilted dialogue, but there is a backbone to the film in terms of narrative that is often more noir than it is horror. The promotional material for the film in 1970 promised an explosive and shocking conclusion (ala William Castle's ""Homicidal""), and while it doesn't necessarily shock, there is a trippy murder scene followed by an even trippier closing bit. Masterful? Not necessarily. Memorable? Sure. Punctuating the entire film is an equally psychedelic and often unnerving score.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and truly feel that it's gotten the reputation it has due to mismatched expectations. I'd liken the film more to a ""horror noir"" if anything. I think if audiences can go into the film without the expectations conjured up by the sensationalistic title, they will find an amusing, relatively well-shot psychothriller that has more in common with the thriller and noir films of the forties and fifties. While it's not high art, I can say ""Blood Mania"" is one of the more skillfully-made (and entertaining) pieces of seventies sleaze I've seen. 7/10.",positive,movie
113212,"Storm War (2011) DVD I watched titled ""Weather Wars"" 1st watched 8/3/2014 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Todor Chapkanov): Exciting and well-written movie about a scientist who's funding is cutoff by the government on a project where the intent was to use weather as an asset channeling it into a weapon for the country. The senator who dropped the funding becomes a target to the elderly scientist years later as he's perfected his research and is using it as revenge. The main evil character is played by Stacy Keach – his two sons and a former assistant try to help the government track him down before he kills a lot of people. Keach's character poses initially as a bum to plant a tracking device on the Senator and then let's lose the energy sources that create the weather anomalies. Keach does a great job in this role and the rest of the cast carry the load well despite the somewhat inconceivable plot. The director, Todor Chapkanov, keeps the story moving with the only flaw being an attempt at throwing in some romance, which in my opinion, was un-necessary. Otherwise the story flows well and keeps your interest to the very end. The Senator's character is sometimes too hardlined and formulaic as far as being the no-holds barred rough guy, but the other characters are believable. The sons are two totally different personalities – one following in his father's footsteps and the other going the other direction – which makes for an interesting collaboration. As the father continues bringing down his haters the group work well together to try and bring him down and stop the ultimate destruction of the city of Washington D.C. This, in my opinion, was an un-expected gem where this genre is usually too over-the-top for anyone to pay attention --- but they make the possibility seem believable making the movie work.",positive,movie
113849,"The Howling series has gotten a lot of flack over the years, and rightly so. Following the Joe Dante's original werewolf classic, a whole slurry of sequels were made, none of which even remotely living up to anything half as good as the original - and they were getting progressivly worse. Now after 15+ years since the last sequel a new Howling has come out. When I first heard this news, I did what every horror fan did, rolled their eyes and expected the worst - another sequel! BUT after watching it I actually really really enjoyed it! It takes a whole new approach to the series (so there's no need to have seen any of the previous installments). A mix between SCREAM and THE HOWLING, this is without doubt the second best film in the franchise, just second to the undeniable classic. Whilst it's comparison to TWILIGHT may put some of the more gore-hungry horror fans off, don't let it! Although there are TWILIGHT elements present such as werewolves, romance and a topless guy (the very fetching Landon Liboiron) to satisfy those fans, there's much much more on offer here. From the werewolf-know-it-all a la SCREAM, sexy werewolf women and a fresh new story that really draws you in and keeps you captivated right up to the action-packed ending, it's got lots here to please hardcore horror fans as well as those just getting into horror.If you like horror films with plenty of teens running around, fearing for their lives like URBAN LEGEND, SCREAM, HALLOWEEN and countless others with a werewolf twist, then I would highly recommend this film! It's surprisingly the best werewolf film of recent years with some rather nice touches. The werewolves look incredible in this and there's plenty of them especially in the second half.I'd give it a 7/10. A must see for all werewolf fans, HOWLING fans and horror fans (both old and new).",positive,movie

Upon finding a film that was just beginning I began to become enthralled in ""The Marsh."" I must say that in reading several other reviews of this film I became a bit aggravated and even somewhat confused by the harsh tone which many reviewers attacked the film. This isn't a great film but it is a very good film, especially for horror fans that spend so much time searching for something that qualifies as decent. Yes, ""The Marsh"" does seem to rehash some common horror themes and at time the film is a bit predictable, that being said, I found enough originality in this little gem to appreciate it. The best thing ""The Marsh"" has going for it are the it's solid performances and it's stylistic and heartfelt directing. These things alone seem to elevate the film far above many other straight to DVD horror releases. I honestly felt compelled to write a positive review for this film after reading so many negative ones. The film deserves a better wrap than what it's been given by overly pretentious movie goers, the kind only pleased with over hyped and over produced piles of Hollywood crap-fest. I think many of these reviewers should have just watched their copy of ""Forrest Gump"" again. In conclusion it is my sincerest hope that the true horror fans out there will give ""The Marsh"" a look and a fair trial.(looking at you in shame DVD Verdict.)",positive,movie
114204,"Really, the title said it all – fantasy mixed with adventure, fairy tale and a bit of science fiction. A small boy looses his parents as they are in search of a lamp but years pass by and he meets a man who is claimed to be his cousin. The only thing is that the man is on the point of retiring from his job.Starring Amitabh Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh, Jacqueline Fernandes, Sanjay Dutt, this is directed by Sujoy Ghosh while Vishal Shekhar provide the music score.Amitabh Bachchan in a role that has been mentioned quite a few times for a while now, is as usual, excellent and he has managed to carry it off rather well. While Ritesh Deshmukh, in the title role, has done a job that, perhaps, he could have taken it a bit further but never the less, he has performed well. The same, however, can't be said for Jacqueline Fernandes and she could have been more convincing in her role. Sanjay Dutt, is just excellent in his role as the villain and is worth watching. I felt that his role, could have been extended and it would have been better. But both Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt, really carry this film on their shoulders to a level that one can say that is worth watching if you like such films.What also makes this film a bit interesting are the visual effects and these are worth watching and especially the woman who breathes nothing but fire and the fight sequences. The song to listen for ""Ore Saawariya,"" is the one to listen for and is worth listening to.A good film to watch if you like a bit of everything, fantasy, romance, adventure, fairy tale and science fiction is mixed in. A good film for the kids as well.",positive,movie
114422,"I found Stonehenge Apocalypse to be quite entertaining. To put it into perspective, this was a low budget movie and so the viewers expectations should not be 'Star Wars'. But even with that, I believe the story line was good and the actors did an excellent job. There were some loose moments, but having seen enough science fiction movies (even the bad ones), I can assure you that this was a good and entertaining movie.I read some of the previous reviews and found them quite negative. There was one review (seems from a SciFi fan) that seemed to be closer to what I had experienced (I am also a hardcore SciFi fan).Don't expect 'Star Wars' from this and you will be quite entertained.

I have always really enjoyed their music so I was stoked to see the movie. The movie was really good, I was really impressed by all the actual Russian dialogue and the actors (especially Misha Barton) did amazing at speaking the language and speaking with an accent. For the T.A.T.U fans, it is great that the girls actually appear in the film, too bad it wasn't longer. The plot was different too. It is not just a ""lesbian"" film, which was what I was expecting but a story of overcoming the tough road you have been dealt and making your way in the world. Both girls were living a difficult life. One rich but addicted to drugs, the other, poor with no future. Through music and finding each other they eventually ended up living a dream.Breakaway Film http://breakawayradio.ca/film",positive,movie

What a wonderful surprise.Superficially, the film's premise seems to be one of the manyoverdone, tired plots we've seen so often.  Instead, the viewer istreated to a well made, well acted film.  It is suspenseful andbenefits from good special effects for the rats (animatronics andCGI, apparently).The basic storyline concerns a colony of bioengineered rats thatwere inadvertently allowed to escape from a defunct lab in NewYork City.  Years pass and the rats become a massive horde ofaggressive, disease-spreading vermin.  After the HealthDepartment decides to ignore the problem, it is left to anexterminator (Spano) and a department store operations manager(Amick) to investigate the problem and deal with it.Fans of B movie horror should definitely give this a chance.

115107,"This movie is not at all that bad. I rate it a 6 which averages out to *** out of ***** stars. There is some nice stop-motion animation by David Allen and some fine make-up effects, included a neat little creature puppet. The "" Heavy Metal "" segment directed by Charles BaNd does not have much of a point so this is sort of the downfall on the movie. The acting is somewhat corny but what do you expect. It would have been better if David Allen's sequence--Stone Canyon Giant--would have been longer. It is a fine model and the animation is rather smooth. There are only about 12 stop-motion shots, If there were 20 and add a little more plot to this sequence (the actual sequence lasted only about 6-7 minutes but the giant didn't really get to  do anything except chase the protagonist around some large rocks before it gets destroyed.

115129,"Let me admit up front: I know the guy who wrote and directed this movie. I like to think I can be objective about it nonetheless, but in an effort to counteract any bias I might feel, I'll try to base this review (and my rating above) on two fairly objective factors.First, take a look at the cast list: Vanessa Redgrave, Derek Jacobi, and Vinnie Jones. Think about how many movie offers each of them must have at any given moment. You don't get one actor like that (let alone three!) in a low-budget film made by an unknown unless they think there is something special in both the script and the director. Look, there's no reason you should care what I think about this movie--I'm just some anonymous guy on the Internet--but if Vanessa Redgrave, Derek Jacobi, and Vinnie Jones think this film is worth their while, then you should probably pay attention to them.Second, at a time when the British film industry was in something of a slump, the filmmakers behind ""The Riddle"" not only made their movie (with an amazing cast), they got it into the hands of 4.5 MILLION PEOPLE. This would be an impressive accomplishment for any film, but for a quirky, ambitious indie movie, it's unprecedented. And as an aspiring independent filmmaker, I find that inspirational.",positive,movie

I remember it was a blind woman in the New York City apartment. Something like that. All in all I liked the plot, gave us some scares.As far as acting goes, Noell Coet carries this film, she is so pretty and an excellent actress, I hope she gets some more roles and awards too.All in all if you are a horror fan, please take time to watch this film, I think it is worth it.",positive,movie

115427,"Lets get one thing out of the way first, it's obviously going to remind you of Blair Witch. Seriously, can any 'found footage' movie not get that comparison. About halfway through the movie I got really worried that it was going to end up the same way as well as the kids wander into the woods and wind up getting lost. Thankfully that's not how it worked out.Quick rundown on the flick. 5 students, Cassy, Mark, Leo, Tanya and Miriam, head out to Miriams aunts house to celebrate her birthday. It's way out in the boonies and it's quite the trek up there. Along the way they keep being followed by a mysterious van. Eventually they make a turn that the van doesn't and arrive at the house. They're shook up from the van incident and things begin going up and down. When they finally manage to have a good time, something bad will happen. We already know they're all missing so you can figure out what the end result of the movie will be.The acting is well done which is a good thing because thats what's carrying the movie. You get a crappy performance and you get a crappy movie. I believed it all. If they were scared, you could feel it. If they were laughing, I was laughing especially during one scene where Cassy (Laurel Casillo) is pretending to be Leos (Ryan Maslyn) mom. I was laughing out loud and it emphasized the impact of the film. I really got into the performances and experienced the emotions with the characters. As for the villain of the piece, you never see him. I like that aspect of the movie, actually, I like that in any movie. When you can't see or hear the villain it seems to make them that much more evil. You're mind makes up who this person is and what their motivation is and what you think in your head is probably going to be much worse than what a filmmaker could show you. I always find it much more effective.While I did enjoy the movie, it's not without its problems. It's a 'found footage' movie but it has a soundtrack at certain parts. Nothing too obvious but it's there. It helps to build the tension and is effective in its use but it goes against the entire 'found footage' concept. There's also another part that works against the 'found footage' aspect but I won't go into it as it plays an important part of the film. I wouldn't want to ruin anything.It's also a bit slow to start. I found myself getting a bit antsy, wondering when something was going to happen. They're on this long drive into the country so it's understandable that not a lot will be happening but I think some people may be turned off by this. Once everything starts to head downhill the film picks up and I was on the edge of my seat. Like I had said earlier, there's a point where they head out into the woods and get lost. I immediately was overwhelmed with a feeling of ""Oh no, this is how it ends up right? I'm watching a new take on Blair Witch."" I mean, I was worried that this was the end of the film. It doesn't end there and I'm glad it didn't. That would have destroyed the movie right there and I had really been into it up to that point.The final scenes are tense, creepy and even gave my heart a jump at one moment. It's a slow burn towards a great explosion at the end but haters of Blair Witch will never be able to get through it. It stands on its own but if the 'found footage' movie isn't your taste then it's not going to sit well with you. I personally love these kinds of flicks and really got into this one. I was up and down about this one for a while. The soundtrack and other moments that go against the 'found footage' idea bothered me at first but it's these things that wind up making the movie that much better and that's the point, to make a great movie. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but I got into and really enjoyed it.",positive,movie

I will not reveal how they find out but it is very unsettling. With no cell phone reception and no one around for miles, they are completely alone and at the mercy of their stalker.I found this one a little slow to get going but very enjoyable, though with maybe not enough payoff at the conclusion.

115700,"The Dutch making a zombie movie... That's like Americans making a movie about cheese. Still there's a lot to enjoy in Zombibi. First of all, with a very modest budget of about  500.000 the picture looks great. The actors do what they can to entertain and although you cannot always understand what they're saying, you never get bored. To see Amsterdam turn into a zombie zone is also very nice for a change. Actress Gigi Ravelli, known in Holland for her role in the soap GTST, is very funny as a kick-ass cop. Overall it's the story that lets you down. A man wants to rescue a girl and must travel across Amsterdam to do so. The finale is in a skyscraper in Amsterdam Zuidoost, the place where also an alien spaceship crashed that caused this zombie outbreak anyway. Our heroes must fight themselves into the building and save the day. In terms of zombies we have seen it all before and the fact that this one takes place in Holland is a novelty that soon wears off. Yes, this movie goes over the top, or it least tries to. But in the end the film remains pretty safe and ends in standard mode. Makes you wonder what kind of movie somelone like Paul Verhoeven would've made out of it. I think Zombibi was a nice attempt to make a zombie comedy and it's clear that making it was pure fun.

115973,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Having grown up in San Antonio and lived in Texas most of my life, I was quite anxious and apprehensive about this movie.  When news first broke a few years ago regarding this project, Ron Howard was listed as the director and I could not have been more relieved. His treatment of ""Apollo 13"" was nothing short of outstanding.  A few months ago, when the delay in release was announced, I found out Howard was no longer directing and the reins had been turned over to Hancock.  It was then I began to worry.  Sure enough, the obvious weakness in this film is the inconsistent direction and chopiness of the story.  On the other hand, the lead actors are all fantastic!  Patrick Wilson as Travis is just how the stories were told.  Jason Patric brings Jim Bowie (and is extremely impressive knife) to life.  Dennis Quaid does an OK job as Sam Houston, although maybe a bit heavy handed in his approach.  No question, though, that the movie and story belong to Billy Bob Thornton as Davy (he prefers David) Crockett and Emilio Echevarria as Santa Ana.  The arrogance of Santa Ana is chillingly portrayed and Billy Bob continues to prove that he is one of the best actors in the world.  He becomes his characters.  The crucial battle scene (portrayed accurately as being in the dark) is done fairly well, but the bravery and destiny of those involved is heart-breaking.  I would have loved to have seen Ron Howard's version, but am impressed with the accuracy of the storyline of Hancock's film.",positive,movie

It was written and directed by debut feature filmmakers Fabio Guaglione and Fabio Resinaro. The film stars Armie Hammer, Annabelle Wallis, Tom Cullen and Clint Dyer. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, and only a limited indie theatrical release at the Box Office. I mostly enjoyed it.Mike Stevens (Hammer) and Tommy Madison (Cullen) are two US Marines on assignment in North Africa. After Mike fails to assassinate a military target, the two soldiers are spotted by enemy forces and pursued. After the Marines are able to evade their pursuers, they stumble through a mine field, unwittingly, and Tommy is killed while Mike becomes trapped on a mine. Mike uses a military radio to call for help, but he's informed he'll have to wait two days until anyone can come get him. This becomes a huge endurance test, and an even more gruesome psychological battle, for Mike and the viewer.The psychological thriller aspects of the film are great, and there's also some touching drama involving a mysterious local inhabitant (played by Dyer) that helps Mike. Hammer is also good in the lead role, and the film is another admirable tribute to US soldiers. The movie is not so fantastic though when it spends way too much time on family drama (from Mike's past). There's also a little too many flashbacks involving his fiancé (played by Wallis) and crazy dream/hallucination sequences. I think the film would have been a lot better at something more like 85 minutes, instead of 106.

This movie would've been absolutely perfect for teen girls - a classic sleepover movie. However, the inappropriate scenes that don't really have a impact on the movie, build up the R rating.

I don't need ten lines to beef out some idiot. This website sucks. Big time. This show really isn't bad at all, they're a low level 5 year old fairly legit motorcycle club. This is only making people angry because it's exactly what's happening in 90% of the motorcycle clubs around the world. They're probably not gonna make it with their new, young, and hot headed younger patches, they believe they're untouchable and just cause they're wearing a cut and patch, they're all-powerful and godlike. That is what gets clubs snuffed out very fast.",positive,movie
117761,"Before seeing this movie I didn't know anything about the original Wicker Man movie, I even expected a whole different movie after what I had seen in the trailers shown in The Netherlands.After watching the movie, at first I was a little disappointed..Cage isn't performing like he has shown before in other movies and from time to time that results in some strange moments. Now, a day later, all I can say is that the movie left an impression --> the ending kept me interested, even so much that I started reading online about the original movie, which I'll probably see as well. The sinister feeling at the end is priceless. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't ever seen the original movie out of 1973. And from those who have seen it: give it a try, it's really not so bad as everyone makes it sound...",positive,movie

I tried very quickly of everyone saying how beautiful that particular emperor's clothes were.The second film is actually much better, although most people, having slavishly (and inexplicably) dedicated themselves to the rambling and decidedly un-scary first film, will not be willing to choke this one down. It's more of a mainstream horror film, meaning it has a plot and some vague sense of thematics.It is the theme which most people missed that I found the most interesting. The camera in this film turns on itself, and shows that once something has been filmed, it takes on a life of its own apart from the realm of what we call fact or fiction.  I'm reminded of Robert Wisdom who said in Todd Solondz's generally superior _Storytelling_ that ""once you put it on paper, it all becomes fiction.""  It's the same concept here, with film.  A story which may or may not be true, turning itself inside out so many times that neither the audience nor the characters know for sure what the truth is anymore.  It's a cautionary message and a reprimand which seems to have generally gone unheeded.I'll probably see this again.",positive,movie

If you go in with an open mind and click into what the film is doing you'll be treated to an experiential, character driven thriller which pays off in the end. At its center is an award worthy performance by Whitney Able as a very damaged young woman (ex-model) whose internal demons manifest themselves in the darkness of her New York city apartment during the 2003 blackout. The performances are strong all around and it's beautifully shot, especially it's use of darkness and what you don't see. The film can be slow in parts but is ultimately in the service of character arc and building atmosphere. If you have patience you'll be rewarded with an astounding performance and suspenseful voyage into the id.",positive,movie

This film contains more sex, violence, adrenaline action and general stupidity as a dozen of other recent films? In short, Krocodylus is the embodiment of E-N-T-E-R-T-A-I-N-M-E-N-T.

118732,"I have to say, this is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.  I can't even count the number of reviews I read for this movie calling it something like ""the worst movie I've ever seen,"" but apparently some people just don't understand good humor.  Other than Rodney Dangerfield's lines, plus a few by other actors, this movie doesn't contain a lot of straight-forward, obvious humor that a lot of people apparently look for in a movie.  This movie is filled with subtle humor and little things that one has to notice in order to fully appreciate this movie.  I won't comment on the plot specifically, but if you don't want some of the scenes revealed then you might not want to read this until after you see the movie.  First of all, the names of the characters in this movie are outstanding.  Rodney Dangerfield as ""The Rodfather,"" Dom DeLuise as ""The Oddfather,"" and Fabiana Udenio as ""Don Na"" are examples of comedic genius right there.  The scene with all the Dons is great; you even get ""Don King"" in there.  When some of the other reviewers saw this movie, they obviously didn't look for all the little intricacies that make this movie great.  The showing of a small, plain, one-story house as the home of the Calzones, followed by the showing of the interior as a gigantic mansion is brilliant. The cameo by Joey Buttafuoco as himself, and Lou Ferrigno's insistance on being called ""Alice"" even though his character is a huge, muscular guy are two more little things you have to catch to understand the humor in this movie.  I don't even know what to say about the end of the movie either, because just when you think it's over, it's really not.  I laughed so hard because you think the movie is over because of Guppy's stupidity, but then the studio executive breaks through the black screen looking for more to the movie.  Just hilarious.  This movie is like ""Office Space"" where you have to notice the little things and watch the movie more than once to fully appreciate the movie and the comedic talent of the writers.",positive,movie

The story wasn't lame, it wasn't slow, it was OK. So yes, all that loving scenes, it made me go eh, but I'm not 15 anymore, I don't believe in love like that, but I can see why people want to believe and why they love Twilight saga.

Herbie ends up at a junk yard where Ray Peyton, Sr. (Michael Keaton), a NASCAR champ, takes his daughter Maggie (Lindsay Lohan) to buy a car as a college graduation gift. Herbie manages to get Maggie to take him. Maggie has racing in her blood, but her father is afraid for her after she crashed her car into a tree years earlier. Herbie has racing in his oil, and he is going to take Maggie for a wonderful ride. Maggie discovers that Herbie is not just a VW bug, but a fast racing car in disguise, when she races Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), a top NASCAR driver. Herbie is entered into a NASCAR event and Maggie will be the driver. Maggie and the world will find out if she has what it takes to be a Peyton.Children loved the movie and adults will too. The opening credits show scenes from the earlier films and shows where Herbie has been all these years. The storyline was done in the spirit of the old Herbie movies, and Matt Dillon was a good villain. As a fantasy movie, don't think too hard about it being impossible for a VW to be in a NASCAR race. This is an enjoyable movie for the whole family. You will get emotional about Herbie and begin to think that he is alive and not just a car. The family connection and the connection Herbie had with Maggie will touch your heart. Actually, the audience got into the movie when they clapped during the show and at the end. You always like to see the underdog win. (Walt Disney, Run time 1:32, Rated G)(8/10)",positive,movie
119043,"An ocean plane wrecked diplomat is rescued and brought to an island inhabited by a Nobel winning now reclusive scientist and his children; the animals he has been genetically manipulating with human DNA in an attempt to create his vision of a pure species.When this film opened it was panned by the critics. I was never sure why. It opens strong, both visually and musically. The locale is beautifully claustrophobic, appropriate for a secluded tropical island. Stan Winston's creature make up is excellent. The body language of the ""humanimals"" is very interesting. The underlying commentaries on the savagery of society and the morality of biological scientific experimentation are intact. Marlon Brando makes a daring, and critics said poor, choice in playing his Moreau like an effete, physically feeble, unbelievably polite British University English Professor, more eccentrically insane instead of the usual madly insane. Val Kilmer, always a strong performer, as Moreau's assistant Montgomery, does a spot on impersonation of him toward the end of the film. Fairuza Balk, as Moreau's daughter Aissa and David Thewlis as the ""rescued"" diplomat Edward round out the over all well done performances given by all. Favorite line (spoken by The Sayer Of The Law/Ron Perlman: ""Going on two legs is very difficult.""Definitely worth a rent/buy.",positive,movie

119235,"Leatherface is the new installment in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise and let me tell you that it is the best one since the 1974 classic. It's a prequel which I didn't like when I heard it, we've seen what happens when they try to explain much of the backstory of iconic horror characters. The best example is Rob Zombies's Halloween remake. Thankfully Leatherface doesn't make the same mistakes as did the Halloween remake they don't explain you much of Leatherface's childhood or any of that. The plot is fresh for a Chainsaw film, almost all previous films in the franchise have had the same plot, this one changes it and its quite interesting to see. There is plenty of gore in this film which is what I expect from a Chainsaw film and I was not disappointed, the performances were also good from everybody. Overall Leatherface is a nice addition to the franchise and it works perfectly as a prequel, you can watch it and then see the original and I think you will enjoy it even more. Forget Texas Chainsaw: The Beginning, because Leatherface is the true prequel.",positive,movie

Even though this movie was quite predictable, IMHO, it was still a great watch and we were spared the over-the-top violence that so many other lesser movies rely upon. The only murky part of the film was the whole sequence when Nate hooked up with that over-Inked junkie but I don't want to come too close to Spoiling. I mean I understood what and why it all went down but still... I haven't done a review here in eons but I saw the 4.5 rating for this and felt compelled to get people to give this a shot, well worth it.

The premise of waking up in random places with only 8 minutes to figure out why is a really cool one... Has a touch of Dark City if you would.The acting was fair enough, the choreography was well done, and anyone ranking this lower than a 6 clearly has wayyyyy too high expectations for movies.(Pats back.)

120326,"All I've got to say is, wow. This film was more than what I expected it to be. I thought Lindsay Lohan did a great job. I thought the producers were using her as a prop for attention but honestly, you sort of forget that the tabloid queen was even star of the film. There were some awkward moments and Lindsay sounded nothing like Taylor's solemn voice but she did a great job trying to portray the glam diva. I'm personally a big fan of Lindsay. Although her personal life is in the swings, I've never really seen a bad 'Lohan' movie until I Know Who Killed Me. Since she has been off set for nearly 5 years, I can understand why she wasn't at her Cady Heron status from Mean Girls in 2004. A good acting coach and a smoking patch would be good for her future in film because all that nicotine is straining her voice. Overall, I think she did an okay job. In my eyes, the star of the show was Grant Bowler (Richard Burton).",positive,movie
120330,"The timing here, coupled with the sound, ensures there are plenty of jump-out-of your-seat scares. Good cameras are used, and even if you are not into horror, the clear image gives wonderful backdrops of a green and colourful Columbia. The story is a clever sleight of hand, which (on the dvd) leads to an interesting, and important, raison d'être right after the closing scene. Very sparse but clever use of special effects, poignant toward the end. Watch for them, they are hard to spot, but they are an important part of the puzzle. The actors are top shelf and fully committed, and the daughter is irresistible cute. One cares what happens to her straight away. There's a sense of professionalism to the technical aspects, particularly the editing and shot framing, and it is spooky. I docked it a couple of points because at a certain point toward the end all plot surprise is lost, and I thought what was needed was something more threatening, or wild, perhaps combined with special effects, some sort of horror frenzy to carry us over the finish line. I thought the 'ghosts' could have had a bit more bight even early on and certainly leading up to the finish, maybe a nasty sudden split-second slash or two. My opinion only. The film wasn't over-long and more could have been done with the cool final location. The success of this movie depended pretty much on the parents. The parents are authentic, sensible, conservative and not over-reactive, and thus there is a sense to Out Of The Dark that it is horror played like a quiet melody on a piano, rather than an overture by an orchestra, and I found that intelligent, refreshing and effective, and thus really enjoyed it.",positive,movie
120559,"Heaven help me! I liked this movie, now I am going to be one of the few who did. As you can see from the other reviews a lot of people didn't like this movie, so why did I? 1. I came in with low expectations - I was expecting something horrible, boring, long and pointless, but despite myself I liked it, I laughed at the jokes, I connected with the actors (yes, Rihanna too), I was excited by the action and while clichés the plot held my interest 2. The actors did a good job with what they were given - Taylor Kitsch did a good job, Rihanna wasn't that bad, I dare say good, in her role. She was there, she didn't try to chew the scenery, she did her job as an actor/secondary character and it didn't bother me. I give her kudos3. lost in translation? - you try to make a game into a movie and you want to put parts of them game in it? Not easy, a little cheesy? Of course, but fun? Yes, fun, enjoyable, and in the end it was a part of the story that wasn't as forced as it could have been. So in conclusion, ""Battleship"" is a fun, corny, typical summer movie that I like but as you see a lot of people didn't. I think it is a guilty pleasure, something to be enjoyed by the few but annoyed by the rest. In the end I can only suggest this - go in with low expectations, expect a little over the top patriotism like in ""Act of Valor"" ( but not so heavy), and don't think about it. The movie is not without its flaws or questionable logic, but as it was said so well in another movie - ""I suggest you don't think about it and just enjoy the ride""",positive,movie

But be open to the fact that it will almost certainly not be exactly what you expect. Although it looks like a somewhat mindless kick ass, eye candy flick, don't be fooled: there is a pretty good story here, and its deeper than your first impression of it will be, also. Oh, and don't try and predict the ending.After you watch it, you will need to process what actually happened, but put your thinking cap on- because its deeper than you think.All in all, the acting was good enough (though it didn't blow my mind), the visuals are stellar (did blow my mind) and the soundtrack is amazing (where is my mind?).

120674,"Brüno is a gay Austrian fashion reporter impersonated by the man that notoriously starred as Borat in... Borat.(For those that have seen Borat: you probably know what to expect. If you did not like Borat for the painfully explicit content, stay away from Brüno. If you almost died of laughter during a certain hotel scene in Borat, go see Brüno immediately and prepare for almost certain death.) Obviously, having made Borat, the producers of Brüno had a hard time to repeat the surprise effect. It should therefore not come as a surprise that the movie contains substantially less confrontations between the main character and innocent (famous) bystanders. Still, confrontations with a number of people, among which a few famous ones, seem sincere, and work on multiple levels, as in Borat. Others are clearly scripted, but not less funny for that (watch the ending credits for an example).In general, compared to Borat, Brüno focuses more on a) effectively shocking it's viewers with the (sexual) misconduct of the main character and b) stunts of this main character in front of a large audience. Essentially, this time the shock effect is moved from the 'random' people that appear in the movie, to the audience looking at the movie.For many, it will definitely be more shocking than Borat, given the shamelessly explicit content that exploits every possibility for jokes concerning men making out. For others, the never-ending provoked racism of Borat will have a longer-lasting impact.All I know is that I laughed a lot during this movie. It will once again lead to lots of controversy and imitation at thousands of workplaces around the globe. Maybe it is therefore best if you know what it is about.But be warned.

120696,"We should all know the rundown by now...Carrie is the remake of the  1976 cult classic flick by the same name, which was based on the famous  Stephen King novel. In the '76 movie, Sissy Spacek plays the outcast  teen-aged girl, abused by her classmates in school and by her mother at  home, until she discovers her psychic powers...then all hell breaks  loose. It's a classic revenge tale, and the original movie was good  enough to earn Spacek an Oscar.   Know this: the 2013 version isn't a direct remake of the '76 movie.  While it does feel like a loving homage to the older flick, it actually  stays closer to the book in terms of plot, with some modern touches  perfectly sprinkled in, allowing Carrie White to feel right at home in  2013.   Now know this: This movie is good. Very good.  Julianne Moore takes us to a very creepy place as Margaret White, and  Chloë Grace Moretz SHINES as Carrie, proving that she's got more up her  acting sleeves than Hit-Girl. By the time you get to the end of this  movie, even though you know damn well what's going to happen...you WANT  the prom to go smoothly. You WANT Carrie to be happy, and you HOPE that  none of those terrible things actually happen. You're in Carrie's  corner the whole way.  And when revenge time comes along, it's done with a purpose. Special  effects get dabbed in here and there, but never overdone. (Slo-mo makes  one scene sooo much more deliciously satisfying...) Although I'll say  that it feels like there may have been a scene or two that didn't make  the final edit, and you can really tell where that scene was...a bit  sloppy on that editing there...

Is the Devil made to look attractive? Well, yeah, I'd say Elizabeth Hurley is pretty attractive!The beginning is the best part of the film, and the end - with a dumb New Age message - is the worst. Along the way, the dumb Brendan Fraser's ""Elliott Richards"" learns some valuable lessons in his battle with the Devil. For selling his soul, so to speak, he gets seven wishes and we witness how he handles, or mishandles, these wishes. Much of it is pretty funny. Fraser is not a bad.

121374,"No one said that this movie was aiming for anything else than having a good time watching it.My guess is that everybody that disliked the film never liked Inspector Clouseau for example, or Indiana Jones movies. It is fairly obvious that Clouseau and Kato are Mortdecai & Joki in this one, minus Clouseau's unshakeable trust to his police force skills.Lord Charlie never gets as cocky in front of his ""team"" of spouse and male servant, for nothing more than his good taste and hideous moustache that surely reminds us of his noble background and also provides some good laughs. It is his ""pipe and hat"", or ""whip and hat"", if you prefer, his trademark appearance set. It is fairly obvious that the screenwriters and director tried to reference the opening scene with Temple Of Doom. Lord Mortdecai is a kind of Indiana Jones in the art business, finding lost paintings e.t.c., minus the naive US perspective of a morally right hero. He is a British Lord after all, thus corrupted, pompous and easily sold out to the highest bidder, due to personal debts created by the excesses of luxury and pretentious/decandant aristocratic way of life. Anyway, enough with the U.S. haters, that simply don't get it. In order of an American getting it, the dialogues should have been filled with gangsta rap slang..Then and only then, the joke would be obvious. Now, with this posh dialect and witty selections of words (like using a thesaurus) they should try to understand what's been said, than just laugh with the out-of-context, expressions such as ""yeah"", ""biatch"", ""sista"". African Americans are still used by/for white ignorance and it seems that it is fairly impossible for Americans to get anything funny that isn't in their cultural status, even if this foreign cultural element rather aims to ridicule itself, than seriously impose on any other culture. Americans must felt offended by Charlie's visit in the US or from quotes like: ""have we taken a wrong turn and arrived to a set of a pornographic film?"", while they were checking in a hotel, because I just can't otherwise understand their dislike to this film. It seems that Quentin alone can't persuade the American audience of the virtues of well written dialogues with unusual vocabulary choices. Now tell me, which is more preferable: ""son of a wh..re"" or Charlie's line addressing one of his abusers: ""your mother and father only met once and money changed hands..propably less than a 20"".. David Coepp is a successful screenplay writer, and a fair director, his all star cast performs the way they should be, and are at points hilarious, the plot is fairly twisting... I just can't understand why Depp is not as good as Sparrow, or Paltrow not as good as Iron Man's Potts, or Mc Gregor not as good as Obi-Wan. You might say that only Bettany provides a performance lesser of what expected of him, but that should be rather credited to the screenplay, or the role itself, than his effort which is adequate. The soundtrack contains one of the coolest songs in a movie (Johanna feat. MIles Kane). It is simply one of the best movies for the start of 2015. In the universe of trendy sequels this movie could easily provide a franchise similar to Edward's Pink Panther for the new millenia, much more successful than the American reboot of the series (with the god Steve Martin). I wanted to rank it even higher but I considered this unfair to other movies that are interested in achieving something greater than two hours of fun.

Stiffler getting the beat down from midgets ( little people) was great. Eugene Levy is all thats left from the original cast but he does a good job, in an Axl Rose minus Slash,Duff, Matt, and Izzy kinda way. He lends credit to the continuing American Pie theme. Although he really had to be placed at weird points, in the movie. It was great listening to him tell cousin Stiffler that he was at the school hanging out, because he's an alumni. Which is actually true, I think? Theschool used was the McMaster University Campus, in Hamilton. Eugenes from Hamilton, and as far as I know went to school at Mac. with Dave Thomas, and other Second City alumni.

121477,"Eight out of ten.This movie is SO cute, and has a good number of funny moments.  It's got cameos both recognizable (Bill Paxton) and obscure (Mike Judge).  It's one of the first films shot completely digitally, and the special effects actually serve the story, rather than just being the sole reason the studio thinks you'll watch-- as with high-budget, low brains movies like ""Daredevil"" or ""The Core,"" ... or ""Spider-Man.""  There, I said it.My one complaint is there's no character.  Carmen gets a little, as she deals with her crush on Gary Giggles.  The Dad (Banderas) gets a little, as he actively fears his in-laws.  Most everyone else is just kinda there.Still, some might say it's ""just a kids movie.""  This is true.  And both the writing, acting AND special effects, as well as overall creativity (the MOST important thing) are not only better than the first Spy Kids, they're better than the first Harry Potter, as well.  There, I said it.",positive,movie
121621,"Rumour has it that 'Rumor Has It' is a pretty good film. This will by no means be an Oscar contender, but as a pleasant diversion on a weekend afternoon, or possibly as a date movie (for those who still go on dates), this could be a winning movie. Jennifer Aniston, late of 'Friends', plays a role that is in many ways reminiscent of the Rachel role - she is a transplanted New Yorker, returning home to L.A. (actually, Pasadena, which becomes a running joke) with her as-yet-unannounced fiancé to attend her younger sister's wedding. We learn all of this in the first few minutes, possibly before the credits are done scrolling on the screen - the frenetic pace of 'Friends' is still here.Rumour has it that there was a family in Pasadena that the film 'The Graduate' is based upon - Sarah (Anniston) fixates upon the idea that this may be her family. She questions her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine, but don't call her grandmother), who tells of a possible affair her mother had with a playboy before her marriage (Kevin Costner, now a dot-com mega-millionaire). Sarah goes off without her fiancé in search of her mother's past, but finds a past of her own, of a sort.Lots of twists and turns in the film have the characters racing up and down the coast of California in search of the past, the future, and the truth, which ends up being both expected and unexpected in this complicated but easily-followed plot.There aren't major effects and major surprises here. The situational comedy is very much in keeping with an extended version of a comfortable television show, even with the star power of MacLaine and Costner backing Anniston up. The writing is serviceable with occasional flashes of true wit, and the pace of the film is even and pleasant. In all, this is a good film, well worth seeing for a bit of entertainment. Director Rob Reiner does have a talent for good films, and this is one of them.",positive,movie
121649,"I dived in with an open and curious mind and I've been entertained and had a good time.It's an eerie story regarding some art pieces that shouldn't have been taken.
Whose the perfect victim for a cursed object that kills whoever profits by greed from it?
Greedy profesionals from the ""chic"" art-gallery bussiness.An artist pours their experience, soul, emotions and illusion into a piece, and when all that is just treated for the ""chic"" and ""popular"" value and exploited, without any apreciation on all that's behind, something's wrong.We see that in different moments from artists that suffer the consequences of these greedy profesionals that don't care about the artist, just about that sweet dolla, and their own reputation and ego.In a world driven by this kind of behaviour. It's the own art's responsability to put an end to them.I can clearly see the message Dan Gilroy was transmitting and I loved it and applaud him for it as an artist myself. Thank you.PD: I read some people saying that the characters don't feel true. And oh my sweet summer children, stay in that place of ignorance, because those kind of people really exist in the ""chic"" art-exhibit and fashion world.

121670,"We follow the story, mainly with Igor. Igor is taken in by Victor Frankenstein; His life flips upside down, they become a team, and we, the audience continue to follow the adventures, as well as embodiment of these two characters, as they both create a scientific breakthrough. Or in this case, reanimation. Honestly, I found this movie to be a little misspoken for. I can see where many were expecting non - stop occurrences with the reanimated creature we've all come to know and love. Before anything else of this review, there is little of that. But here's the thing, does that make this entire thing bad? No. This film was actually creative, and quite good. First off, I honestly love the charm, and creativity of this story. The entire execution of the film's telling of this entire tale, I found to be flawless. The entire telling fell within the amazing character chemistry between Igor, and Victor. Which, by the way, both Daniel Radcliffe, and James McAvoy had amazing chemistry together. You could watch, and feel the connection their characters, if that, actors shared together. The characters in this film, while on the topic, were all around great. I can't emphasize this enough, horror, if that, thriller's now, usually have unlikeable characters - But not here. This film has characters that you could actually bare with, characters that'll you'll grow to, and actually bond with, sharing feelings for their actions. Of course, however, you have a small collection of characters you grow to dislike, but of course by intend of the film itself. I personally found the entire, overall plot, and storyline to be charming. I found the rescue, and bonding of savior friendship between Igor, and Victor to be all around charming, and just flat out awesome. It thrills us, audience, while at the same time develop feelings for the characters. Moving to visual elements, first of all, I honestly loved the entire visual effects of this film. I felt as if it was beautiful, and succeeded in giving us a flat out, solid display of the Victorian era, or in other words steam-punk. It felt intriguing to look at, visual eye-candy as far as the eye can see, giving an attention - grabbing effect. The camera work compliments as well, giving us some pretty well placed shots of which show the action sequences, as well as the meaningful ones. Lastly. I honestly liked the creations. The re-animated figures looked distorted, something they're supposed to succeed at. It didn't look cheap, and honestly was great for the time they came around, with their grotesque features, not too gory, or disgusting, but at the same time not too light, or cheap. In conclusion, this film succeeds in a pleasant surprise. Once again, I can see where people get disappointed, as we see barely any real ""Frankenstein"" or in this case, the reanimated monster, at least not as much as many may of expected. However, the film succeeded in dismissing that, as we're giving many succeeding elements, including stunning visual effects, great, likable characters. I fun, at the same time thrilling story, and an overall unique charm that doesn't disappoint. Although, as said before this wasn't a strong ""horror"" but for what it was, aside the dismiss of the appearances of monsters, this was a fun film, enjoyable, and over all fantastic. I'd highly recommend this one.",positive,movie
121894,"This movie is hugely underestimated and the critics' score is plain ridiculous. This movie is a rare beast a quality science-fiction survival horror. Yes, a quality one. The cast is impressive and the acting is really good, Laurence Fishburne did well for sure. The movie has some beautiful scenery, and the setting (frozen Earth) and the plot is solid enough. Sure, for science-fiction it has some flaws for example, footprints hold during the night on the snow despite the never-ending blizzard. Or the ""certain"" tribe is so big it shouldn't be able to survive (taking into account their ration). But... that's about it. I can't recall any other major problem and I saw this movie just yesterday. Besides, this is the fourth post-apocalyptic movie of 2013 that I have seen. ""The Oblivion"" was obviously the best, hands down. And this is also the simple fact that ""After Earth"" was obviously the worst. Taking into account their budgets, I would say ""The Colony"" is no worse than ""World War Z"". There is no unnecessary pathos and its characters definitely has more depth and creates more of viewers' willingness to empathize them.",positive,movie
122176,"""Clinical Trials Phase 1:"" 8.5/10.""A Ride in the Park:"" 8.5/10.""Safe Haven:"" 8.5/10.""Slumber Party Alien Abduction:"" 5/10.It seems like only yesterday I reviewed the horror anthology V/H/S. The film was a likable little horror flick that focused prominently on showcasing independent filmmakers that have made noise in their respected field recently and gave us the first horror anthology film since Chillerama. It was gory, pleasant, and nostalgia thanks to its choppy aesthetic. Not even a year after the release of the original film we have V/H/S/2 (originally titled ""S-VHS,"" referencing the improved upgrade of the traditional VHS tape released in the late eighties), a slicker, broader, and a more brutal take on the idea of anthologies showcasing more talents from the independent circuit.The only returning director from V/H/S is Adam Wingard, who shot the wraparound story that encapsulating all the shorts in the original. It was only wise to overhaul the old directors in favor of newer ones to give the new franchise a broader reach. Wingard returns manning the camera and starring in the first short, titled ""Clinical Trials Phase 1,"" where he plays a man whose eye has just been replaced with a glass eye housing a camera, being one of the testers of this new technology. The doctor warns him there may be glitches in the software that will be reviewed when he submits the ""eye tape"" to the programmers. The entire short is shot through this eye camera, and shortly after he gets home we see the camera welcome in a slew of demonic entities. The story is elevated by a girl who enters the man's life, telling him he is not alone in the regard that his technology welcomes in new frights in his life and that's what gives this story the leverage it needs to succeed. The terrific POV perspective helps too, and this is a recurring theme in the film as we begin to see.Following Wingard's short is ""A Ride in the Park,"" directed by Eduardo Sánchez (The Blair Witch Project) and Gregg Hale, focusing, at first, on a biker traveling through the woods before being victim to a bunch of what-appear-to-be zombies lurking in the woods. The short, shot entirely using a Go-Pro camera mounted on the biker's helmet, shows the biker evolving into an inhuman creature, eventually attacking a birthday party and the party guests. The perspective, again, livens up a seemingly drab idea. Sánchez still knows how to utilize a woodsy setting, and the ending warrants a nice jump and a quick-shriek. Very solid piece all around.I have a feeling Gareth Evans and Timo Tjahjanto's ""Safe Haven"" will be the fan-favorite of the lot and it very well should be. This is a smart, intense thriller that could've easily been broadened and expanded to feature-film status. The short, which occupies the longest runtime at about thirty minutes, focuses on a gang of investigative journalists who explore a shady, Indonesian cult. Reciting the plot any further doesn't do much justice, as this is a short that relies heavily on tone, editing, and plot. Evans, who directed the ever-so popular The Raid: Redemption last year does big things with the atmosphere and the possibilities with ""Safe Haven,"" consistently making it taut and terrifying. It's a fan-favorite for a good reason.We end, unfortunately, on a sour note, with Jason Eisener's ""Alien Abduction Slumber Party."" Most of the short is shot from a camera mounted on the back of a small Yorkie dog (who is killed at the end for good measure) and centers around a group of friends having a party at a lake house after the parents take off, with the gang being victim to an alien invasion. An easy summation for the short is chaotic, as the editing is scrambled, shots are astonishingly disjointedly cut, and Eisener has almost no sense of placement or cohesion with the videography occurring here. Directors are usually at piece with their material and what they're shooting; Eisener is wrestling his to the point where it seems to be no fun for him or for us.The wraparound story shows two private detectives in search of a missing male college student. They enter his home, find a slew of VHS tapes, and get to work private investigating. The wraparound - like the first film - is pretty lame and sterile. There are no real scares to be found, no real jollies to be had from the characters or the events, and all it really serves as the connective tissue to three very well done shorts and one lukewarm one.V/H/S/2, as a whole, is a thoroughly amusing one, and certainly one of the better horror films of the last year. It's an exceptional rarity, as well, seeing a sequel come out less than a year after its predecessor that is equal parts more efficient and more effective. I can see this film getting better reception from viewers and critics alike, as the film follows a more quietly subversive style in terms of videography and directing, rather than the original film, which was more concerned with blunt force scares. I suppose the biggest compliment one could pay to an anthology is that the stories could be made into feature length films, and in this case, all but one passes the test.Directed by: Simon Barrett, Adam Wingard, Eduardo Sánchez, Gregg Hale, Gareth Evans, Timo Tjahjanto, and Jason Eisener.",positive,movie
122280,"What does it take to make a good thriller? Suspense, to feel the tension, to give you the chills. And this movie did that in the right way! Don't get influenced by subjective people who walked of the movie after the first 10 minutes!If you love good flicks that give you goosebumps and mainly love thrillers, this is the perfect movie for you. Watching the trailer I was expecting mediocre movie, but what I got was way above that. It reminded me of another Halle Berry's thriller - The Call from 2013 which was very good too.I can't say it's a perfect film, it has it's flaws. There is only one ""what happened to that"" moment. You know, when some questions aren't answered, but it wasn't that big of a deal at all.Halle Berry's stellar and compelling performance definitely sells the character of a suffering mother trying to safe her kid's life. The other actors did pretty good job too.The film pushes the right buttons to make you feel the suspense in the whole run time. It surely deserves 10/10!",positive,movie
122481,"This and Under Siege are Seagal's best easily. The rest of his movies are strictly average or below, and he has been responsible for some real crapsters, like Ticker and On Deadly Ground.This may not have a great story, but, this film, better than his rest, really showcase Stevens Aikido skills. The fights in this a great, and theres a lot of them. In his first few films, which all felt remarkebly similar, this, Hard to Kill and Out for Justice, he had lots of fights, simply filmed. Under Siege was a fun movie and great but had very little in the way of fights, since then his films have been poor and he hasn't worked with as good directors in terms of action.Add to that fact that this is Seagal in the best shape of his career. He's not the muscleman, oily chested, cheese grator ab's, hardman like Lundgren, Van Damme and Ah-nuld. He seems more of an everyman with a real toughness to him. He had a real ""don't mess with me"" aura in his old films, now it is sad to see him looking as old and out of shape as he does.He seems to have got worse over the years as an actor. This is the best performance I have seen from Seagal, he actually seems human and plays his character with some personality. Andrew Davis seems to get the best out of him, in this and in Under Siege.This film boasts a good cast, including sexy ladies like Pam  Grier and Sharon Stone. There is a good pace to it all and a message, as with most Seagal films, but the message is actually given subtlety, not ramned in your face like in his horrible eco-warrior films.

122561,"Amy Heckerling's latest teen comedy, 'Loser', is an old-fashioned charmer where nice guys finish first, sweet girls end up making the right choices, and pushy 'users' get their just desserts! Perhaps nobility is passe in films today, but 'Loser' makes a great case for working class heroes who succeed by 'doing the right thing'.Paul Tannek (Jason Biggs) is a farm boy who wins a scholarship to a college in New York City. Bright, awkward, and shy, and possessing the worst haircut since Adam Sandler's in 'Little Nicky', he accepts his family's celebration of his success with embarrassment, and a fear of failure, but his father (Dan Aykroyd, who is wonderful in his brief scenes) offers simple advice: ""Listen to people, look them in the eye. Be a friend, and you'll succeed.""Cut to New York City (which has never looked more beautiful), and Paul's worst fears are coming true. His dress is ridiculed, his roommates are 'too cool' jerks who take advantage of him while dissing him, and his instructors, particularly Professor Alcott (Greg Kinnear, at his smarmiest!) snub him imperiously. Paul is lonely and frustrated, which makes a simple act of kindness by fellow student Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari, in her best performance, to date) take on special significance to him. Diamond is a kindred spirit, although she has been manipulated into believing Professor Alcott loves her, and has become his clandestine lover.As both of their lives take downward turns (he gets thrown out of his dorm, she loses her waitress job), they develop a platonic friendship (he is far too much a gentleman to attempt to break up a relationship!), and the film becomes a game of guessing when these two terrific people will realize they belong together!'Loser' features a lot of very funny cameos, by Andy Dick, David Spade, Andrea Martin, Colleen Camp, many others, and, to Heckerling's credit, these 'guests' never detract from the positive message of the film.This makes a great date movie (particularly if your date loves kittens!), and is a 'feel-good' flick you can enjoy again and again!

It comes, however, with excellent modern drawing, natural 3D art and animation to add to a distinct story of friends & sharing.At the base of this is a great, very simple to understand story for kids. Treasure your friends and share with them. It's more complex than that, involving theft both direct and indirect, and some devious political-like characters for adults to enjoy.The humor in the film alternates from kiddy and tween to puns and some more amusing adult idiosyncrasies and allusions.

122694,"I can understand the negative reviews. Understanding life with all the strings that are attached to it is an art, that asks both experience and knowledge. If a viewer is not of a high enough level in both these playing fields then he or she will label it based on their experience and knowledge on life this far. Psychology and interaction between human beings mostly runs indirectly. Someones true intentions and feelings can be sought and found in the indirect speech we output during dialogue. Mallick indirectly tries to reach out to the higher conscious viewer by attaching multiple of these indirect strings. And he attaches a lot of them, mostly more at once. It's like he absolutely has no care for commercial success. This film is just as inaccessible as ""The Tree of life"" if not more than that.There are symbols and metaphors running all over the place. Over the diegetic dialogue of his characters to the non-diegetic narration to the settings and body language of the characters. There were a lot of times where the meaning of the narration matched the body language, which matched the scenery's emotional impact which matched the scene that followed which then matched the symbol of the scenery in the scene that followed. There are many nuances, creating a gradient in the ways the viewer can understand the scenes. Ranging from blank to enlightened. There is an ever going debate between Mallick fans and the ones whom negatively criticize his work. The fans state all their personal observations, while the negative critics all tout that the scenes are scrambled and that there is no concrete meaning to the story; That all that the fans are doing is connecting the dots in the way they personally see fit.The tree of life orchestrates a much broader concept line. Parallel lines drawn from the life of a family to the motions of the universe. Knight of Cups puts the magnifying glass on the feelings of Rick and his surrounding souls. The focus is more on the psychology and what the stages of time and location, can do to ones feelings and desires. A level 1 can never see the light of what level 3 is displaying. Level 1 can only understand and comprehend level 1 shimmering, while seeing glimpses of light from level 2. Open your mind and soul far enough and you can ascend to another level by gaining experience and knowledge. Mallick reaches out to the higher levels out there, mostly to levels too high. It creates a gap that allows 95% of the viewers to label this as a fragrance commercial. What a shame, memes might end being documented while Mallick's views could get lost in translation. I told you that I can understand the negative feedback, but sadly do not relate to it. Amazing film, Mallick at his best. I expect great things from his upcoming projects.

I watch a lot of horror movies, and while I do enjoy most of them, it does get rather boring watching the same ole plots get rehashed and redone. Finally we are given something new and just plain out insane.The story itself was very original, but the execution is truly what was the best about this whole film. They do such a good job of just presenting you with a family that you hardly ever see in these types of movies. A dysfunctional who appears normal is something that has been portrayed in horror films in the past, but this film does it in a way that will just shock and awe you.The score for the film is actually pretty great. It was full of songs im sure pretty much nobody has ever heard before. Every single song really did a good job of complimenting the mood of each scene, however some of the songs did seem a bit out of place.There were some pretty gross scenes, but nothing you haven't seen before. I did see the youtube video of the man complaining about the content of this film. I do not believe that he was a plant since I do kind of see where he is coming from, but the movie is not nearly as disturbing as he makes it out to be.My review makes this this movie out to be the prefect horror film, but it did have its faults. It does start to get a tad boring towards the middle, but it does end up picking up pretty well. Also, the ending seemed a bit rushed.This was a very enjoyable horror film.

It is a shame everything gets dubbed in cinemas in Hungary these days. Nevertheless, it is lucky for us that there is always a place somewhere in the capital where the theatre shows American films in the form they were intended to be presented to the audience.The movie takes place in 1979, if I am not mistaken. As one could expect from Mr Spielberg the era is presented meticulously. Movie posters here and there, kid listening to his Walkman, old cars driven on the streets and of course the children trying to shoot their dream movie with the use of a Super 8 camera.I do not remember when was the last time I saw children acting superbly. Although the main character's father, the deputy in the town, has a vital role, as well, he is not in the focus and we are more interested in seeing the kids' struggle to finish the film even after the derailment of a train and the subsequent appearance of the US Air Force.I am not lying to you: I was afraid Spielberg would not be enough to make it a successful movie and J.J Abrams would only mess up the story. If you think about it: Cloverfeld meets the Extra Terrestrial? Come on!Yet, it works! It is a wonderful piece of work which, yes, most of the time reminds us of the small alien who wanted to go home but it's been almost 30 years since then so should it really be a concern that someone tries to borrow elements from a successful movie?I was stuck to my seat the whole time and was eagerly waiting for the end of a wonderful journey. If you did not like the trailer there is no point in ruining your evening. However, if you did like it and E.T. was something that makes you remember your childhood vividly, give it a try, you will not regret it!I give it a solid 8 out of 10. Well done, guys!

Colorful visuals, often hilarious, and decent directing.There is nothing wrong with the voice acting. The main cast, Jesse Eisenber and Anne Hathaway are like the bird versions of them. Jemaine Clement really made his character evil. The rest of the cast, Will.i.am, Jamie Foxx and George Lopez adds more fun to the movie. I just wish Tracy Morgan's character Luiz had more scenes.The visuals are colorful and very spectacular. It really shows how beautiful Rio De Janeiro is. The flying sequence is indeed breathtaking even if it's in 2D. The problem of the movie is it's not so compelling. The ending seems rushed. We will all know what's gonna happened to this flightless bird. Although the movie has a big heart. The movie is often funny of course.Overall it's a fun experience.

123862,"Here is a movie that, to be sure, is part fantasy, part wacky comedy; but to call `What Women Want,' directed by Nancy Meyers, `just' a comedy would be not only inaccurate, but would be doing an injustice to the film as well. Because-- while there are plenty of laughs to be had (especially early on)-- in the end, there is a lot more bite and substance to it than first meets the eye.  Enough to definitely raise it far above the `fluff' piece many will perceive it to be, if only due to some shallow reviews and the theatrical trailer currently being shown, which gives only the vaguest notion of what this movie is really all about.  In fact, once most of the `cute' stuff is out of the way (about a third of the way through), the film really starts to get good,with a message about decency that is worthwhile, if only it can penetrate the formidable barrier of the viewer with an attention span barely able to accommodate an episode of `Friends.'  Beyond the humor, there is a story here about a man named Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) who literally receives the shock of his life, and afterwards must deal with who he is by coming to terms with his past, realizing the truth about himself in the present, and understanding what his future will be if he does not change his ways .  It's something of a contemporary take on `A Christmas Carol,' with Nick an egotistical, self-centered, witty (In his own eyes) Scrooge; a veritable legend in his own mind, which is not-- as he comes to find out-- necessarily the way he is perceived by many of those around him, especially the women in his professional life. 	The screenplay, written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, is extremely insightful and brought to the screen with equal acuity by director Meyers, who goes to great lengths at the beginning of the film to explain Nick's exaggerated chauvinism, what made him the `Man's man' he has become.  And while it is clever and effective, closer scrutiny in the editing room may have benefited the overall film, as his character is somewhat `overly' established.  But just about at the point when you're saying to yourself, `All right I get it!' Meyers grabs the helm with both hands and suddenly the ship is at full mast and on course, where she keeps it for the rest of the journey.  The turning point comes after Nick's visit to a marriage counselor (a terrific cameo by Bette Midler) with whom he had had business some years before.  It's as if not only Nick, but Meyers as well, had heeded Bette's advice. 	Mel Gibson does a good job of getting into Nick Marshall's skin, and he's to be commended for going out on a limb and taking on a character that may not be immediately embraced by even die-hard Gibson fans.  It's a testimony to his ability as an actor, though, because he does make Nick the epitome of chauvinism, and except for the few throw-back Neanderthals (women as well as men) still in existence who subscribe to the `Man's man' theory of de-evolution, Nick will effect the same response from the audience that he does in the minds of many of the women who surround him in the movie.  It's only when you've had a chance to consider Gibson's performance at arm's length that you will realize how good he is in this film.  On the other hand, the real saving grace of this movie is immediately discernible, and that is the performance of the wonderful Helen Hunt.  As Darcy McGuire, the professional hired to lead the ad agency for whom Nick works into the Twenty-first Century, Hunt is nothing less than sensational.  One of the most gifted, expressive actors in the business, she raises the level of the drama (not to mention the comedy) by succinctly conveying the strength-- and at the same time the vulnerability-- of Darcy, while exhibiting a depth of emotion that adds so much to the impact (and the success) of the film. And, in a notable supporting role, Judy Greer is memorable as Erin, a lonely young woman who works at the ad agency.  It's the `Tiny Tim' role of the film, and though a small part, it figures prominently in revealing Nick's inner-most feelings at a pivotal moment of the film. 	Rounding out the supporting cast are Alan Alda (Dan), Marisa Tomei (Lola), Ashley Johnson (Alexandra), Mark Feuerstein (Morgan), Lauren Holly (Gigi), Delta Burke (Eve), Valerie Perrine (Margo) and Sarah Paulson (Annie).  What Meyers has created here is a mixed-bag, sleight-of-hand bit of entertainment that is so much more than what it seems to be on the surface that it is bound to evoke an equally mixed-bag of reactions (positive and negative) from the audience.  It's amusing-- downright funny at times-- but also exasperating.  To receive the full rewards offered by `What Women Want,' you're going to have to give it something as well.  If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get in return.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",positive,movie
123913,"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (1999) ***1/2Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Robert Carlyle, Denise Richards, Sophie Marceau, Robbie Coltrane, Judi Dench, and John Cleese Directed by Michael Apted, written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. Running time: 127 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for strong action violence and sexuality)By Blake French:	""The World is not Enough"" is the type of James Bond movie audiences have grown to love. With the latest installments being ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""Goldeneye,"" I was starting to lose confidence in our philandering spy. However, Michael Apted's new thriller has enough action excitement, character chemistry, and plot twists for several films, leaving ""The World is Not Enough,"" as not only an absorbing adventure, but also a strongly crafted one.	Pierce Brosnan is easily the best James Bond next to Sean Connery. He returns as private agent 007, licensed to kill, James Bond, working for his employers M (Judi Dench) and R (John Cleese). In this film, the line of events center on the young daughter of an oil tycoon named Elektra King (Sophie Marceau). She is under much pressure from many worldly individual's due to her inheritance and responsibility with important pipelines. After Elektra's father is murdered, Bond comes to her with the instinct that she might be in danger. Electra realizes Bond is correct, especially when they are chased through the mountains by deadly terrorists with machine guns. She accepts his protection, and ends up sleeping with Bond, developing a romantic relationship that may or may not be a big mistake.	What makes ""The World Is Not Enough"" so good is the development of its villain, named Renard (Robert Carlyle). The way he is presented is exceedingly above average. The filmmakers gradually build up tension the way he is executed on screen. We first hear of him from dialogue of his employee's, who, as they are about to be arrested, kill themselves in fear of what this Renard will do to them. ""I can protect you"" pleads Bond, ""Not from him"" states the accomplice as she puts herself out of her misery.
	We then learn of his level of power and his special abilities. Renard is able to withstand enormous amounts of pain due to a bullet wound in his brain that is slowly killing him, but until it does he'll grow stronger every day. The audience then sees his figure on a computer image; a ghastly looking man with an unmerciful, evil look on his face. When we finally do meet Renard in person, he holds a fire stone in his palm as he beholds smart, decisive plans and murders one of his failed workers.  This development is not near the level of the material presented in ""The Usual Suspects,"" but as sharp and smart as the writing otherwise comes.
 ""The World is Not Enough"" also prevails with its structure. The film's first act is precise and persuasive in its motives and characters. The flawlessly planned break comes when Bond decides to seek out and protect the third witness, Elektra. Each scene following this series of events is exciting and forward moving. The action scenes do not distract the plot from becoming successful, but evolve the tension and contain purpose. I did think the third act dragged on a bit too long, although it did sum up our conflicts. This is a movie that is focused and yet at the same time goes in so many different directions and contains so many unexpected twists, it is hard to keep up with it.  	The acting is galvanizing energetic and, for the most part, well cast. Pierce Brosnan once again brings his sly, stylish wit to the Bond character, giving him life and the womanizing stunts and skill we know 007 to accommodate. Robert Carlyle proves to reprise another villain role, straight from his earlier film, ""Ravenous."" Sophie Marceau is also very charming and seductive, as always, conveying elegant beatitude. The young, perfect Bond bosom, Denise Richards, only proves to be miscast here. We are unable to believe her character, a nuclear physicist named Dr. Christmas Jones. Although she does provide us with one of the movie's most memorable lines: as she and Bond lay in bed, we here James question ""I thought Christmas comes only once a year?""Brought to you by MGM Productions.",positive,movie
124023,This is a very enjoyable movie. James and Charlize (I am on first name basis with them or too lazy to write last names) turn in very good performances and I can't say either out performs the other they both do a great job.I will not go too in depth into the plot but as spy movies this is more Munich than James Bond. I enjoyed it quite a bit and I think most fans of this genre or either actor(actress) will as well.Take some time and check out this movie.,positive,movie
124146,"GOOD - Simply an enjoyable movie; lots of fun to watch and highlighted by a humorous Basketball game. Also, the surround sound is very good, the colors are beautiful, the cartoon effects well done and funny. Some of the humor is laugh-out-loud variety. As with a many good animated movies, there is so much to see and hear it would take many viewings to catch all the gags. With each viewing, you'll laugh at things you never noticed before. As far as ""live"" actors working with cartoon figures, this was much better done than the earlier ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" so progress has been made in that area. While there is a lot going on, there are enough lulls to give viewers periodic breaks. The basketball action is fun to watch and I was surprised how well real-life stars Larry Bird and Michael Jordan acted.BAD - The story gets a little too juvenile in spots. The PC-minded female character (rabbit) is overly feminist, to the point of irritation and the occult gets far too much credibility in this story. Also, there are a few sexual innuendos in here that adults would catch but, hopefully, not little kids.OVERALL, a movie that appeals to adults and kids. Basketball fans will really enjoy it.",positive,movie
124185,I felt the story of Cinderella was was beautifully done. The acting was just as it should be for a fairy tale. The colours and the magic vibrant. The actors and actresses played their parts wonderfully.Taking a story and making it into a movie most times is difficult. How we have interpreted the story can be very different from what the director envisioned. As a lover of all fairy tales I enjoyed the movie. I believe all little girls and even grown ups like me can appreciate how well they did with the movie.All in all it was well done.,positive,movie
124192,"Riding on after the fun and at times hilariously over-the-top ""Transporter 2"", Jason Statham is back as Frank Martin, aka, The Transporter in ""Transporter 3."" And, if you enjoyed the previous films, I can guarantee you will love this ride of mayhem.This time around, Martin has been kidnapped and forced into his new job by Robert Knepper's character, the villain known only as 'Johnson.' Johnson has slapped a chemical-bomb-bracelet onto Martin which will explode if he strays from his car by more than 75-feet- an insurance policy to make sure he completes his task- transporting a sexy young woman named Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) and two mysterious bags throughout parts of Europe, for reasons unknown. There is a plot involving Valentina being kidnapped, and being used by Johnson to blackmail her powerful father, but it isn't very important to the overall story, it is just there to justify the action.And action is something this movie doesn't skimp out on. While not as show-offish as the previous film, which had action in every-other-scene, this entry in the series definitely has its share of fist-fights and car-chases, explosions and gun-battles. Director Olivier Megaton (no, I'm not making that up), takes over for Louis Leterrier (co-director of the previous two entries) and does a good job at maintaining the mood set by previous films, and he does great with the action. Though I will say the camera-work is sometimes sub-par, and sometimes a little too ""Jason Bourne Shaky."" But overall, if I wasn't told any different, I'd assume Leterrier was still directing, which is good, because a series like this should generally feel consistent.The story itself (written by ""Transporter"" and ""Transporter 2"" scribes Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen) is halfway decent for a silly, PG-13 action-fest, and ends up being much better than most will give it credit for. I've already seen the comments of the film being bad, but we all know that those aren't the type of people to be listening too. If someone accuses the third film in a silly franchise like this of ""sucking"", and then complains about the plot or the characters, then that person is taking it too seriously. This ain't a serious movie, this is a ""brain drain"" movie... where you let your brain shut off and you drain your IQ for the 100 minute running length while letting yourself be thrilled, before exiting the theater and turning the ole' noggin back on.This is ""dumb fun"" at its finest.Also returning as Inspector Tarconi is Francois Berleand, now given much more screen time as the comic relief and the guy who gets to piece together the story for the audience. He does wonderful, as always.A large portion of the film involves the love-story between Martin and Valentina, and this is where the movie may become hit-or-miss for the fans. Essentially, Valentina is the ""Anti-Frank Martin""- she is fun-loving, spunky and very open to anything. Frank finds her annoying at first, but you can tell he almost envies her lifestyle compared to his own strict life, which he now is starting to realize has been holding him back. You can tell they are a good match for each other because they even each other out. And Rudakova does a good job with the role, though the audience may think she goes a little too far during certain scenes, where her antics go wild. Still, she adds a lot to the plot, and keeps the story fresh- after all, we can deduce that Frank was never able to keep his connections with Lai, or ""go anywhere"" with Mrs. Billings from the previous films. And hey, Rudakova made me fall in love with her (and her character), so thats gotta count for something.One last comment on Jason Statham, the star of the film, before I wrap this up. I truly think this series has proved he has what it takes to make it as a big-time star. He has had to show emotions through a character that likes to ignore or disregard them, and he has proved himself physically. He's also a decent actor. I think this series, and particularly Statham, are not getting the attention they deserve.All-in-all, I liked ""Transporter 3"", it was a great ride filled with good action, cool characters and a silly but decent, cliché-ridden story. And hey, clichés are clichés, but they work! I give it, as a fan, an 8 out of 10.",positive,movie
124212,"The Man in the Iron Mask, fresh off the massive success of Titanic, we got the next movie starring huge heart throb Leonardo DiCaprio along with some of Hollywood's strongest male leads. Including a couple of my favorite actors John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons, so this was a movie I was looking forward to seeing, not to mention I was 13 at the time of this release and was totally in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, oh yes, good times. So of course this movie was love at first site with me, but as I grew up and watched the movie without my crush influence, I still found it to be a good solid movie. Leonardo stays strong as his first duo role as King Louis and Philippe and proves he can stand up with the heavyweights of Hollywood. Jeremy and John together with Leonardo had great chemistry and made The Man in the Iron Mask a really good watchable movie.France is under the reign of King Louis XIV, who is bankrupting the country with his unpopular wars. When starving peasants in Paris start to riot for food, he responds by ordering his chief adviser, to send them rotten food. Meanwhile, the King wallows in hedonistic luxury while seducing a parade of women. The legendary three musketeers have retired from their posts: Aramis is now a priest of the Jesuit Order; Porthos is running a Parisian brothel; Athos has a son named Raoul who is just back from the war and ready to marry the girl he loves, Christine. At a festival, the two lovers are greeted by an older D'Artagnan, just before Raoul can propose, the King's eyes fall on Christine. He arranges for Raoul to be returned to combat and killed in a suicidal charge. In the wake of Raoul's death, Aramis initiates a plot to overthrow the King with the help of his old comrades. Only Athos and Porthos agree to the plan; D'Artangan refuses to betray his oath of allegiance. The three musketeers sneak into an island prison and arrange the escape of a mysterious prisoner: a man in an iron mask. Philippe, the identical twin of King Louis. While he looks indistinguishable from his brother, Philippe is compassionate and gentle and the plan is to replace Louis with Philippe.While I've expressed my love for John and Jeremy, the true talent comes out in Gabriel Byrne's performance as well as Leonardo DiCaprio. Gabriel as D'Artagnan was just beautiful, charming, dashing, and very charismatic. While the movie could have had a little better direction, in some ways this felt more like a made for TV film at times, just with the big names. I'd say that's the movie's main flaw, but they were not given a big budget to make it into a great movie. Also the fact that Leonardo as Philippe, they take the iron mask off his face and he's still pretty! Eh, still I'd highly recommend it, it's the actors that make this movie very delightful to watch, one for all and all for one this movie is just tons of fun! Hey, that almost rhymes, I made a funny! OK, there's my cheesy joke, I'm done, just watch the movie.8/10",positive,movie

Johnny's only help is from his loyal partner (Ben Miller) and a beautiful, mysterious spy woman (Natalie Imbruglia) could help bring Sauvage to Justice.Directed by Peter Howitt (Anti-Trust, Laws of Attraction, Sliding Doors) made a entertaining comedy that spoofs the films of James Bond and The Naked Gun Trilogy.

124446,"In the kingdom of Cloister, in Albion, there is a legend about giants that came from the realm of Gantua, between Earth and Heaven, using a large beam stalk and were defeated by King Eric that was wearing a magic crown. The eighteen year-old day-dreamer farmer Jack (Nicholas Hoult) has been fascinated by this tale since he was a boy. When he goes to the market to sell his uncle's horse and cart to buy material to repair the farmhouse roof, he defends the honor of Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), who is also fan of the legend and is secretly in town, and Jack has a crush on her. Then he stumbles with a monk that has stolen magic beams from the evil Roderick (Stanley Tucci), who is engaged with Isabelle, and he offers the beams to Jack to have his horse and escape from the soldiers that are chasing him. When Jack shows the beams to his uncle, he throws them on the floor, angry with the naivety of his nephew. Meanwhile Isabelle flees from the castle to have her own adventure but she finds a storm and seeks shelter coincidently at Jack's farmhouse. But one of the beams is watered and a huge beam stalk grows, taking Jack's house with the princess trapped inside. When King Brahmwell (Ian McShane) arrives in Jack's land with his knights, he sends a team of the princess's guardians to seek out Isabelle. Jack volunteers to go with them, led by the knights Elmont (Ewan McGregor), Crawe (Eddie Marsan) and Bald (Mingus Johnston). Roderick and his right-arm Wicke (Ewen Bremner) cut the rope and most of the knights falls from the sky and dies. Soon they find the land of Gantua and learn that the giants are not legend. Will they succeed to rescue Princess Isabelle? And what are the evil intentions of Roderick and Wicke? ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is a great family entertainment with a funny and full of action story. The special effects are top-notch and as usual, professional critics, pretentious intellectuals and imbeciles do not like this type of movie, but they insist on watching it to write bad reviews. Bryan Singer again makes a great movie and the only but would be Nicholas Hoult in the role of an eighteen year-old teenager. The character could be a little older in the story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Jack - O Caçador de Gigantes"" (""Jack – The Giants Hunter"")",positive,movie
124656,"When a man puts a classified ad in the newspaper asking for a companion to time travel with him, a magazine writer and two interns go find him to find out his story. Aubrey Plaza plays Darius, one of the interns who at first seems pretty disinterested in the whole situation, ends up being the one who has to pretend like she wants to time travel. She expects to be working with a total nutjob, completely off his rocker, but instead she finds that Kenneth, the man who put the ad in the paper, is actually an incredible insightful, sweet, and softhearted person and that time traveling is more a facade for finding yourself and it's more of a metaphor for fixing old mistakes. It's a surprisingly touching film that has a lot more to offer than one might have expected.Great dramadies are few and far between these days. They are usually too unfocused, can't find that perfect balance between comedy and drama, and try too hard to be profound when it comes to taking a look at the human condition. Safety Not Guaranteed finds a way past all these things. It has a clear and poignant focus that drives a heartfelt and oddly moving story. It's a great blend of comedy and drama as it tells a great story on a very human level, but also delivers its own pleasant brand of comedy. It's more clever comedy than laugh out loud comedy, but it fits just right for what this movie is trying to accomplish.Safety Not Guaranteed could have easily been a sham and it could have gone too far overboard on its profundities. Instead, the excellent script keeps itself at bay and manages to tell a story that is more sincere than one would expect and feels more real than a dramady that is trying to be the most realistic of human stories. There's nothing here that will floor you or blow you out of the water, but it truly is a lovely and heartwarming story.Normally feel good movies aren't my thing, but Safety Not Guaranteed is sincere enough and of a quality that makes it an absolute joy to watch. That being said, I don't know that I'd watch it again, and I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it's great for one viewing and it's an hour and a half well spent.

I blame Lionsgate for the most part, since they're the main company churning out horrible movies and calling them ""horror."" The Strangers is a nice breath of fresh suspense. It takes a simple premise (instead of over-complicating things with super natural B.S. like the movies mentioned in this review's title) and makes it truly frightening. I thrives on simple moments, but those moments are full of intensity and fear. The acting is on point, the script is very real, and it all feels very fresh.

One scene in particular which involved an apple, I just had to turn away from. As far as formula, my daughter and I took bets on the ending about a third of the way through. I pretty much called it, but wasn't completely sure until the last five minutes. Not too formulaic, not too out of left field, no clear explanation given but a lot implied.

The best issue in this film is almost constant action and wild biking through the New York streets. One of the elements that were new to the screen and highly workable were the sudden stop of action to follow the split-second decision making of a messenger/biker. Choices (usualy three) that have to be made in the moment. The bad guy in the film is nasty and very believable. So, if you're looking for a thrill ride and a fun film then go see it.

125258,"I have to admit, I was very impressed and surprised with how great Letters to Juliet ended up being and how much I enjoyed it. I was very entertained throughout the entire film with it's interesting story plot and likable characters. Amanda Seyfried plays as a sweet, young, engaged woman named Sophie who finds a note written over 50 years ago by Claire, portrayed by the amazing Vanessa Redgrave, who talks of her one true love Lorenzo, and Sophie replies.The film starts off strong and doesn't let up. It's brilliantly played out by the actors and actresses and it becomes more entertaining with each second. I loved the whole concept and found myself smiling at so many scenes for how endearing it was. The characters, while not the most excellent characters ever conceived, are very believable and likable to an extent. The actors and actresses make them seem sincere and the directing is good too, as well as the writing.Really what makes me enjoy this film so much is how entertaining and compelling it ends up being at every turn. I always enjoy Amanda Seyfried's performances and the movie itself is a really adorable and amusing adventure. I laughed, I felt compassion, and I walked out of the theater feeling refreshed and rejuvenated because of how sweet it was and how much it moved me. Really the only downside is that there was a Taylor Swift song used around the end.While it's certainly not a masterpiece, I praise it for being able to go way past the average ""rom com"" or ""tearjerker"" and just be a simply pleasing experience with very fun scenes and a great sense of romance and happiness that I was touched by.

I did feel that they introduced ""Big Daddy"" way to early in the film and overused him. I would have enjoyed the movie more if he was just another zombie. Cameo's by Simon Pegg, Tom Savini, and Edgar Wright were barely noticeable. I would have liked to see more ""daytime"" scenes but I don't think that is what Romero had in mind.

During their travel, Ian and Felicia discover that their feelings are more than friendship and that Tasty is not who she told she is.I am still laughing with ""Sex Drive"" since this movie is one of the funniest comedies that I have recently seen. There are many gross jokes, beautiful tits and girls and enjoyable characters. The cynical Seth Green is simply hilarious in the role of a sympathetic Amish. The scene when Ian is on the stage watching the dancers backstage while a pregnant girl is telling her sad story is so funny that I needed to stop the movie just to laugh. The last scene with Amanda Crew in the end of the credits is also very funny, and I believe many people probably lost this joke. If you are intellectual, or if you do not like this type of movie, please do not spend your time to write bad reviews in IMDb.

125552,"When Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody struck gold with ""Juno"" in 2007, they did so with a rare combination of contemporary wit, quirkiness and heart. Their four-year reunion in ""Young Adult"" won't be nearly as heralded, but it might arguably be a better film. Although ironic when juxtaposed with its main character, a 37-year-old who hasn't gotten over her high school sweetheart, Reitman and Cody display obvious evidence of maturation. The subject and humor are decidedly darker, and the emotional energy more raw and challenging. Charlize Theron stars as Mavis Gary, perhaps one of film's most hopelessly pathetic protagonists. Before giving the opening credit sequence its cue, Reitman puts Theron to work and paints a clear picture of spiraling drunken loneliness, reality TV and apathy toward responsibility. Appropriately, she's a young-adult fiction writer for a dwindling book series who's also a former prom queen. Theron is perfect for the role with her combination of in- concealable beauty and dramatic prowess. Mavis never becomes a caricature under her watch.Unable to get past the fact that her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) just had a baby, Mavis flees her depressing cyclical lifestyle in Minneapolis for her home town of Mercury, Minn. with the intention of winning him back.Mavis' delusional and deceitful quest to be a home-wrecker proves maddening through much of the film at the slow-burn pace Reitman has dictated, and it becomes obvious that at some point the bubble on her misguided journey will burst into an ugly mess. Yet despite this foreseeable direction, the climax proves stirring and not without a set of surprises.Adding to the complexity of Mavis reclaiming her past is Matt (Patton Oswalt), a former classmate she barely noticed because they were miles apart on the social spectrum. The two bond over their appreciation for (or dependency on) bourbon, and their relationship allows Theron's character a chance to blow off steam, albeit irresponsibly. Mavis eventually remembers Matt as the ""hate crime kid"" because he was brutally beaten to the point of being disabled in high school at the hands of some jocks who thought he was gay. He serves as a strong comparison point for Mavis' high school experience throughout the film. Oswalt's wit also matches well with Cody's style and Matt actually turns into one of the better depictions of a disabled character probably ever. Other than the incident that caused it, we're not asked to sympathize excessively with his condition, nor do Mavis' snarky remarks about it come across as rude. Cody's dialogue is much more restrained this time around; ""Juno"" is eons funnier as a result, but the sacrifice of laughs allows us to focus on the film as a character study of a woman who hasn't quite learned how to be an adult. The script's only deficiency comes from a crater- sized hole in Mavis' history. ""Young Adult"" deserves praise for being a film about living in the past that contains not a single flashback, but knowing more about Mavis' divorce and how she came to break up with Buddy the first time could have significantly informed the story, especially as to why Mavis willfully lives her life as the trainwreck it clearly is.The film's climax helps a bit in this regard, and Mavis' epiphany avoids being cliché despite the obvious ""appreciate what you have"" motif. Part of the message oddly suggests that small- town folks lead purposeless lives for the sake of achieving some kind of blissful stasis, but at the same time the idea that all of us are broken people that need to affirm and trudge forward — not backward — with our various blemishes, will surely resonate.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com",positive,movie

Wesley Snipes(From the ""Blade"" Series)and Woody Harrelson(Who was just in Semi-Pro)are two of the best actors ever and they are superb actors in this movie. If you are a fan of any sports movies i recommend you should see this movie as soon as possible. If you like Wesley Snipes or Woody Harrelson you will for sure love this movie. The plot of this movie is very good. My overall rating on White Men Can't Jump is...8/10See it as soon as you can, rent it from a local movie store or even buy it and you will love it.",positive,movie

Clay witnesses the dialogs in the room and discovers dark secrets about his surgery.""Awake' has a simple but effective story about a wealthy young man that needs to be submitted to heart transplantation and experiences an anesthetic awareness discovering that things are not like he believes they are.

125978,"*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*As a huge fan of the first film, I went to watch the movie as soon as it came out. And I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all.Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Offers so much thrills and an awesome cinematic experience, The action starts right from the opening scene and it doesn't end until the last 2 seconds of the film. The people behind the movie just knew how to not make the audience bored, and they succeeded at that.I have to say that 3D ticket here is worth the additional price, because honestly, if any movie deserved to be really watched in 3D it's this one,It adds so much depth to the scenes and makes the movie alive.The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never really drags even with the movie's long duration.The soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.Due to the movie's high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd were very pleased.In the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else. It's simply one of these movies that are always fun to watch.",positive,movie
126203,"Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has just arrived from Krakozhia in JFK Airport, when there is a coup in his small eastern country, with the revolutionary forces taking the government by force. The USA does not recognize the new government and the validity of his VISA and passport are canceled. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the bureaucratic administrator of the airport, who rules by the book and does not show any compassion for people, leaves Viktor, who does not speak English, in the international lounge of the airport with a problem without solution. While patiently living in Gate 67 for a long period, Viktor survives, learns English by himself, makes new friends among the employees of the airport and falls in love for Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). ""The Terminal"" is a delightful and uncommon fable about a patient man who is trapped by the bureaucracy in the international lounge of JFK. I heard that an equivalent event would have happened indeed in Paris, but there is no reference on the DVD, and the writer takes the credits for the idea of this theme. Anyway, Steven Spielberg is really magic, and was able to make a delightful movie with such a weird storyline. Tom Hanks is excellent as usual and the beauty of Catherine Zeta-Jones is still very impressive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Terminal"" (""The Terminal"")",positive,movie
126225,"American Gangster has been really hated upon in many of the former posts I have read. Yet it seems like they are all saying the same thing, that Gangster didn't have enough action and was really drawn out. Anyone who has every seen a Ridley Scott film will know that his films are long! Blade Runner, A Good Year, Matchstick Men, Hannibal, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, G.I. Jane, Thelma and Louis, and Alien all ran for at least two hours or more, so big surprise there guys. In addition Scott didn't set out to film another scarface, he set out to tell a story not just about Frank Lucas but rather a tale of corruption and how pervasive it is. One user commented that this film had many side story lines that ""bloated"" the story. This is completely untrue as every ""side story"" is actually the overarching story about the fight against corruption in every facet of life, even Frank Lucas attempts several times to eradicate the corruption in his organization.Over all this is a great film which really gets into every nook and cranny of an issue. Don't see this film if your just looking for cheap thrills, this is a thinking film about the pervasive dishonesty of our culture.I gave this film 8 stars because i could find nothing solid that detracted from it, but rather a slew of minor details which gradually brought its score down. But I will put this film in my top films for the year, if only because I have been immensely unsatisfied with the bulk of releases this year.",positive,movie
126370,"So I just finished watching Equalizer (EQ1) again, so I can watch Equalizer 2 (EQ2) for the comparison.It's too bad both films had the same director and writers, as they have a bad habit of dragging out the writing and the scenes. Both films at just over 2 hours is just way too long, especially in the simplistic singular plot or EQ1. However, that plot still worked, and mainly because of the entire casts especially Denzel Washington's performance(s). EQ2 certainly had better pacing and a more suspenseful plot - albeit predictable, however it had many plot issues and holes as well as some scenes that needed to be edited down. The new supporting cast was not as strong either. Which did I enjoy better? Probably EQ1 by a small margin, but they both got an 8/10 from me, as they each had their merits and issues. Nevertheless still enjoyable. I hope if they come out with a EQ3, they speed up the pacing within the writing and directing.",positive,movie

126833,"Just saw this at TIFF . I saw the trailer a few days before the screening and I have to admit the trailer alone made me a little emotional. I mean just the thought of a 5 year old separated from his family for 25 years is bad enough, add in the fact that he was lost in India, a country of over a billion people and was the child of an uneducated poor single mother and you are looking at a very stressful situation.This happens there everyday..and most children never find their way back. They either end up dead or in the hands of heartless people who use children for various illegal / unethical operations. The fact that one boy survived this situation and went on to tell his story is very inspiring and this fantastic film did justice to showing it on screen.There wasn't a single scene in the movie which doesn't suck you in. Hats off to Dev Patel. He managed to make you feel the character's pain just by the way he looked at a jalebi (indian sweet that his brother and him fantasized about back in India). Special shoutout to the young actor who played little Saroo. His performance blew me away. It would be difficult to watch any child go through what he did and the fact that he was absolutely adorable looking made it even harder. The movie explores some great themes: What happens to lost children in developing countries? How do poor, illiterate citizens of a country go about finding their lost children...who helps them? What are the dangers faced by these lost children? Why do certain people choose to adopt? How do adopted children adapt to their surroundings? Especially when they're transplanted so many miles away from home where they do not even speak the language. Do children every fully recover from traumatic childhood experiences? Does one forget their original family if they never see them again after the age of 5? As an adopted child do you ever completely feel like you fit into your new life? What is the bond with your adoptive parents like? The film touches upon all these themes while primarily being about the physical and emotional journey of a young man finding his way back home with very few clues to work with.I kid you not, I could hear the whole theatre crying during several parts of the movie and most people had tissues in their hands. So be prepared. If you're in the mood for a heart wrenching drama with an uplifting ending, go watch this one once its out! The lead cast as well as supporting members have all done a wonderful job.

126842,"Spike Lee has created an almost unimaginably uneven career in films, but it has never been in doubt, that he is one of the most talented American filmmakers of his generation. And should you have forgotten that, now you can remind yourself by watching the amazing ""BlacKkKlansman"", which won the Grand Prix at Cannes in May.""BlacKkKlansman"" tells the true story of a rookie African American police officer who in the 70's infiltrated in the KKK, but that's certainly not what the movie is about. Lee tackles head-on the contemporary hot topics of racism, the police killing black Americans, and white supremacy to create an overwhelming pamphlet about the American identity - which has been hurled into a state of great confusion after the last presidential election.Movies don't come much more political as this one. In a way, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a companion piece to ""The Post"" - a movie that similarly discussed the current political climate in a 70's setting - but with loads more of blackness, humour, anger and attitude. It's a better movie, too.Though not perfect. Form-wise, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is sometimes paced oddly and feels needlessly long: not overlong, exactly, because you're not going to be bored for a minute. Visually it could have used a little more of the delicious textures typical of those 70's blacksploitations it makes references to.But Lee is such a virile storyteller, that you can't help but get sucked in it all. And he has SO much to say. ""BlacKkKlansman"" is at its savage best when putting in perspective the official holier-than-thou image of the white Americans: Harry Belafonte cameos as an eye-witness of the beastly lynching of Jesse Washington in 1916.Actors in ""BlacKkKlansman"" are great. John David Washington excels in the lead role. Adam Driver signs what is arguably his best role to date. Ryan Eggold is terrific as the local boss of the KKK, and the Finnish Jasper Pääkkönen impresses as his right hand man. The biggest surprise of all is Topher Grace, who is near-ingenious as David Duke, a well-mannered bag of sleaze in a three-piece.""BlacKkKlansman"" is an incredibly rich and stirring piece of contemporary cinema with enough stuff to fuel a conversation for hours.

126896,"For the 99.999 percent of us who will never climb Mount Everest, the new 3D Imax drama Everest provides plenty of vividly illustrated reasons to rationalize leaving it off one's bucket list. However, there are quite a few good reasons to see this robust dramatization of a 1996 assault on the world's tallest mountain that went disastrously wrong, beginning with the eye-popping, you- are-there visual techniques that make you feel glad indeed that you're not actually up there at 29,029 feet, but also including multiple characters sufficiently humanized to create real concern for their fates, and an attention to realistic detail that gives the film texture. Universal should be able to add this one to its impressive list of 2015 box-office successes. This autumn seems to be the season for vertigo-inducing 3D Imax releases, what with this and the World Trade Center tightrope-walking drama The Walk in the offing. All the same, Everest doesn't go in for cheap shots or sensation for sensation's sake, remaining close to the men and women who have journeyed to the Himalayas for different reasons but for the same purpose: to get to the top of the world. With its perilous central premise and gallery of individuals some of whom are destined not to make it, you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term, but it doesn't feel like one. And that's a good thing. Telling the same story as, but not officially based on, Jon Krakauer 's best-selling book Into Thin Air (perhaps because it was already officially adapted for a 1997 TV movie, Into Thin Air: Death on Everest ), the film hinges on the freakish conditions that led to the deaths of eight climbers on May 10, 1996. Krakauer is present as a character (played by House of Cards' Michael Kelly), there to write an article for Outside magazine. The fact that some engaging, friendly Aussies are front and center as the main tour organizers and guides may account for a good deal of the films immediate accessibility; they're the competent, reassuring type you'd feel good entrusting yourself to on such an expedition. Running Adventure Consultants is Rob Hall ( Jason Clarke), a seemingly all-around great guy, and he's helped out most importantly by logistics coordinator Helen ( Emily Watson ), and guide and close friend Guy (Clarke's fellow ex- Terminator Sam Worthington).",positive,movie

127360,"For Locke's true power as a film to sink in you will need a few days to sit and ponder upon its small yet intricate construction, for in a film that is set almost entirely within the confines of one man's car, Locke deals with many an issue and does so by uncorking a powerhouse Tom Hardy performance and a downright believable script by Brit Steven Knight who here makes up for his dreary directing debut Hummingbird.There will be many out there that have no time for Locke due to its setup and in a way this is not an unjust decision by them for Locke requires much of you as a viewer and does not look to find a way around this. Not perhaps since Ryan Reynolds found himself in a tight situation in Rodrigo Cortes 2010 film Buried has a film relied so heavily on the audience to bear with it and a performer to hold our attention with nothing more than a phone (or Bluetooth) to act alongside with. Locke's tightly focused pacing and realistic scripting are both hugely successful but it is in the performance of Hardy that the film finds its true power and ability to stick with you days after release.Oft cast as the hulking or manic presence within a film as seen in any of Warrior, The Dark Knight Rises or Bronson, Hardy hear is a steely at times inwardly reserved Ivan Locke, a man whose world is crumbling around him despite being sheltered by his luxury ride. Playing Locke with a welsh accent and with a vulnerability within both his eye, Hardy showcases a rarely displayed side to his acting talents that Knight uncovers to great effect. Whether Locke is demanding or pleading, Hardy is in control even though his character is slowly but surely crumbling from within. It's one of the year's best acting turns, unflashy yet utterly commanding, Hardy achieves more with a singly look than some actors do within an entire role. It's worth also mentioning the voice work (the only other people you will hear during the entire movie, no one else is ever seen) of the cast here in Locke, from Olivia Colman through to The Impossible's Tom Holland as Locke's son Eddie, all voice performers give soul to the voices we hear on the phone.A movie to be watched in the tightest surrounds available to you, Locke isn't an easy watch due to its setting and not a movie made for overall public consumption. Locke is however an incredibly smart and well-constructed film that is the perfect showcase for the increasing acting prowess of Tom Hardy, an actor that continues to stake a claim as one of if not the most interesting and diverse performers in the business today.4 Bluetooth calls out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",positive,movie

Roddy Piper, the WWF wrestler, plays a drifter who stumbles upon a huge secret: the powerful elite on Earth are really aliens who exploit the working man. They are disguised as people, but with a pair of special sunglasses, he can see which ones are which. Without a second's worth of questioning, he grabs a shotgun and starts blasting away at every one of the ugly s.o.b.'s. It's silly, but entertainingly so. As an action picture, it's serviceable. Unfortunately, there are long stretches where nothing much happens, and it takes forever for the plot to start moving, instead treating the whole thing as a mystery for about a half-hour, which Carpenter executes badly.

128598,"I watched both seasons at once, over the last few days, so my review concerns the whole series. The animation and art style are brilliant. While some reviewers seem to mind the ridiculous breast sizes, revealing outfits and nude scenes, I think they lightened the mood and didn't feel out of place. The storyline is slightly lacking, with many episodes relying on a single formula: ""Lelouch creates an ingenious plan; all goes well, they almost win without effort; Suzaku shows up and everything falls apart"". While the major plot devices, twists and definitely the finale are great, a lot of the story lines in many episodes seem to be merely fillers. The biggest flaw of the show however, is character development. Especially in Season 2, so many people switch between sides, are conflicted about seemingly obvious choices or make decisions, that contradict what their previous behaviour would suggest. The most apparent example of this is Suzaku. He is created as the opposite of Lelouch, believing in ends never justifying the means and in following the rules in order to change an organisation from within. While I understand that it is not simple for the writers to create such a character, the resulting Suzoku is so over-the-top hypocritical and self-righteous it's painful to watch. It is hence very difficult to emphasise with him as a positive character.The comparison to Death Note is obvious, as many other reviews have shown. In my opinion, Code Geass pales in comparison to Death Note. The latter is deeper, darker and has a masterful story and characters that feel natural. While the action and art style is superior in Code Geass, everything else is better in Death Note.In conclusion, I still give this show 8/10 despite it's great flaws. It is beautiful, captivating and thoughtful. While not the best, it is still very good.",positive,movie

The film is not the play, but you don't often get an opportunity to see a fine cast perform this amazing play, and it needs a fine cast.The movie has a fine cast. The movie grips you from start to finish.  The movie even adds a little; the basement scene works wonderfully in the movie in ways that would be hard or impossible to reproduce on stage.Yes, the play has been bowdlerised to make it into a movie, but what do you expect in 1958.  The reality is, this film is a piece of cinema and drama history.  You'd need to be a ""Williams Fundamentalist"" to hate the movie for its toned-down-ness.  To the balanced Williams fan, it is gripping, well acted and nicely-paced.  Once every 10-15 years there is a truly fine production of this play in a world-class theatre.

I think the Colbert is second only to the Daily Show in terms of being the greatest show currently on air.However, while I never tire of Jon & the Daily Show, I have to admit Stephen can get a little tiring. Jon has other correspondents but Stephen has to carry the show alone. Stephen is also a little stuck as sort of a one-trick pony. He has to play the same character the same way all the time. And when that character is a moronic ego maniacal bombastic rightwing nutjob a**hole (a la Rush L. & Bill O'R.) that can get a bit tiring.The repeating segments are funny. The Daily ""WORD"" is hilarious. The threat down (usually BEARS!); the ""better know a district""; the ""wag of the finger/tip of the hat"" segments are something to look forward to each week. He does rely too much on Yahoo news for funny news bits, not so amusing when I've already read them that day.However my biggest disappointment (and I subtracted an entire star for that)is the increasing product placement on the show.I don't know if Stephen has made some sort of deal where he's actually getting paid or what --but he has started promoting brands like (goldenpalace, kraft, etc.) at first I excused it as ""he's probably satirizing Rush's pushing of Snapple"", but IMHO it's crossing the line into actually advertising.

129020,"(I don't know what the last guy was talking about - this show is laugh out loud funny).The show starts off pretty fast by Frank Tagliano (Steve Van Zandt) who's a New York Mobster, giving up his boss to the FBI. Within the first 20 minutes of the first episode he's relocated to Norway, more specifically, Lillehammer. This is due to the fact that he saw the Winter Olympics in '94 and decided it was a good place to start a new. From there Frank has to adapt to Norwegian society which is proving to be quite the challenge. Public works officials like the good folk over at NAV aren't very helpful when it comes to adapting. Frank soon realizes that in order for him to succeed in Norway, he's going to have to resort to his old ways. The show is funny, very funny. There are some things that seem a little thin, for example how fast he learns to understand Norwegian. Though he doesn't seem to understand a hundred percent of the time what people say (like the review before me implied). Other than that I think everyone who plays a part in this show does a great job. There's no reason why this show would deserve anything beneath a 8/10 rating.And if you think I'm getting paid to say this: No, I'm not.

The Civil War, by contrast, was, as Ken Burns stated, about slavery.

I was looking at you tube and found a remarkable ""making of"" documentary that chronicles the making of this film.This convinced me to finally rent this from Blockbuster. The film really isn't that bad. It is not the greatest film ever made, but it is made with care, attention and a real passion. If you see what goes into this film, then you may not hate it so much.I enjoyed it a lot, but feel is suffered from a lack of budget. I feel there criticisms here are perhaps too harsh... I mean there are some real crap films out there. This film is not in the worst categories. Please make more films like this, but please spend more money next time.

130112,"What can you expect from this movie? Very little and a lot at the same time. It's a Polish production from the 90s and I am from Poland so I can tell you a little about this movie comparing to the rest of Polish productions. First of all here at Poland we focus on making really bad movies, you can count the good ones on one hand (well maybe two hands). But there is a genre in Polish cinematography, you can call it a Polish B movies (that's not a real name btw I just named it that way for the ease of understanding). What are Polish B movies? They are usually an action movies with HUGE amounts of bad language, black humor, nude famous Polish actresses (when they were not that famous like nowadays), bad special fx and horrible acting and don't we forget about a corny story. Good examples of these movies are ""Psy"". These movies are not very well rated even in the eyes of Polish critics but... There are fans of zombie movies, b movies, exploitation movies from USA and in Poland we also have a little ""cult"" to follow. Some ppl just love this kind of movies. Hell, I love this movies and always cry at the end of ""Psy 2""""Wirus"" is one of these movies. The story is pure crap, it's about a programmer/hacker/cracker who writes viruses and those viruses crash many important systems in Poland (stocks exchange, airlines, railways etc). First of all it's year 1996. It's the year when richer Polish families started to buy their first PCs (sth around Pentium I 166Mhz). So as you can assume we knew nothing about computers then :D and we make a movie about a hacker designing viruses:) I just watched this movie and I laughed my ass off real hard. All the computer stuff they do in this movie is just hilarious. Someone wrote in another review about ""plot holes"" and nonsenses. Well.. that person sounds like he/she was expecting another ""Pianist"" movie and have no sense of humor. There is very little of any action scenes, just some shooting and fighting, no big deal. Another gem (apart from hilarious tech scenes) are the nude scenes, of course it only matters to ppl from Poland. Because it would be funny only to us when there is a scene with a famous Polish soap opera actress having hardcore sex.In the end I only recommend this movie if you are interested in some funny computer stuff scenes (making a game out of MS PAINT or MS PAINT designed programs), they steal the show. But if you want to watch it for the story I say ""put this away slowly.."". If by any chances you are Polish reading this, GO WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW! :)",positive,movie
130168,"Water Based Monster Movies is a favorite genre of mine. Since Lake Placid and Anaconda hit theaters, companies like TriMark/Lion's Gate and DEJ Productions have flooded the market with tales of giant Sharks, Snakes and Crocodiles. I own most of these. And, they mostly suck.
Beneath Loch Ness returns the monster to the Under Water Monster movie. Not a recognizable animal you can find in a zoo or aquarium, but one classified as other. Beneath this placid loch lies a lost world of prehistoric terror.
Patrick Bergin made a name for himself in the late 80's and early 90's with some theatrical hits, but has since made his home in the direct to video realm. And we are all the better for it. (For as long as Video Store continue to make this a viable arena.)  Patrick Bergin has become a hallmark of quality in this market.  I have recently purchased 6 of his movies, Curse of Dracula, The Lost World, Treasure Island, Amazon's and Gladiators, Merlin the Return, and Beneath Loch Ness, and while a couple of these are kiddie fare, they all rise above the direct to video heap. Even though Patrick Bergin gets top billing on the box, Brian Wimmer is the main character. He and the rest of the main cast execute their parts well. When watching movies like Shark Attack 2, and Octopus, it becomes impossible to find anyone worthwhile onscreen. While in this movie, it's hard to find any weak links. This is a fun monster movie that takes itself seriously, and is well worth watching. The effects are passable. The characters are likeable.

I will admit thought that on first watching it I did feel that the kids were being somewhat (but not completely) controlled by the alien but on repeated viewings it does appear that that is certainly not the case.

My only complaint about ""Cemetary Gates"" would be the ""monster"", in closeups it is pretty good, when you see it full figure galloping through the woods it was really bad. If you like horror for being horror this is a great movie to kick back and enjoy with a cold beer and pizza. If you want a horror movie that would qualify for an Academy Award, then you are not really interested in a real horror film... are you?

130269,"This is a funny and fun movie for both men and women. From the title, it looks a bit sexist, and it is full of girls wearing bikinis, but truly, none of them seem to mind, and there is not an atmosphere of exploitation. Well, there's a wink at how bad it is running a bikini car wash, but it's balanced out by the love interest, Brittany (Ashley Park), who is taking a feminist film class and questions it all throughout the movie. If you are all about girls washing cars in bikinis, you will get your fill of that and some sexy sex scenes too- there are tasteful and funny sex scenes, but it also has a plot, setting, and great music. The characters are original and funny, esp Vex (Jason Lockhart) the side kick to mild mannered and lovable lead character Jack (Jack Cullison). The scenario of a house full of partying college students desperate to hook up, and also desperate to make a buck is a recurring theme in American sex comedies, and yet, it doesn't get old for college aged students who seem to love to see it- All American Bikini Car Wash feels more like a hip TV series than a film- you can imagine it in several episodes. Viewers who enjoy movies like American Pie, and Something About Mary, will like this movie.

But I was pleasantly surprised.The characters in the film are much more developed than the typical cardboard stereotypes, serving as monster-fodder, that populate most ""creature features."" There is some genuinely good acting here, especially by Brandon Henschel, who enlivens the whole film as a lovable ""bad boy"" teen. Jack Conley is steady and true as the sheriff, and Miles O'Keeffe plays the bad guy with a controlled rage that never goes ""over the top."" And the creature is much more than the usual blood-thirsty maniacal killer in the woods. This is the ""thinking-man's Bigfoot,"" a material/spiritual being who actually becomes the hero of the tale.All in all, while ""The Unknown"" is certainly not ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Gone With the Wind,"" as a suspense/adventure tale it transcends the genre and offers some genuine surprises, as well as a fresh approach to an old legend.

And that she did. It was hard to take your eyes off Her when she was on screen. She had that in common with the two other M's of the era, Monroe and Mansfield.This Movie has a lot in it that defies explanation.

So overall, this is quite a slice of late 1950's Teen Life, at least what was being shown at the Drive-In, and is an underrated fun time with the added bonus of Fan Favorite Eddie Cochran on screen with a speaking part as well as delivering an Air-Guitar version of ""Cotton Picker"" (Baum-Baum-Baum).",positive,movie

132255,"When a massive Megalodon shark is released into the ocean's waters, a Navy team is forced to utilize a monstrous shark-shaped submarine to combat the deadly creature before it's wake of destruction covers the entire planet.This is a massively entertaining and enjoyable effort that really has a lot going for it. One of the best aspects here is the generous helping of cheesy action spread throughout, since the massive shark is unleashed quite early on in the film which manages to get the new submarine into action as well which is quite an entertaining feat considering the amount of time the two spend battling each other is so high that they take an additional connotation that doesn't touch the past instances in the series by finally putting a worthwhile opponent into battle in an environment with the gigantic creature. The submarine being the same size makes for a truly worthwhile battle of the titans between the two and it happens frequently throughout the film, as the attack on the aircraft carrier, the assault on the carrier fleet and the later battle at the oil rig all allow for some really engaging battles between the two behemoths in an enjoyable cheesy manner, and by being spread throughout the film as a whole makes for quite a lot of fun that helps out in the latter part of the film. Having a full-scale city destruction sequence in the middle of the battle between the two accounts for even more exciting action to take place and the film is grossly overwhelming seeing the giant robot wade through the city leaving as much destruction as it does. Not to be outdone in that regard, it's certainly got the best rip on the airliner-out-of-the-sky routine here with an enjoyable cheesy take on the classic scene in the franchise which is a lot of fun. Again, though, the fact that the CGI featured here looks so bad as it does is something to get over when the robot never really gives off the metallic vibe beyond the overall design featured all sorts of different gears and lenses which reveal its' true nature even though the shark itself is easily the best-rendered of the series despite the frequent and annoying size fluctuations which have always plagued the franchise. Still, the only other true flaw on display is the finale, which has a lot of mention towards the sharks' spawning and breeding instinct but is overshadowed to make way for the city destruction sequences that contain all the action but undercuts the story since such a big deal was made about it throughout the last act of the film. Otherwise, this is a lot of fun overall.Rated R: Violence and Language.",positive,movie
133088,"Getting to watch this film again after a full year, I discovered that two versions of it exist on cheapo DVDs from differing companies. (The differences may have been due to time demands from TV broadcast.) I'll call them A and B.Version B is slightly longer than A; it includes more snippets from the original Russian sci-fi film (Planet of Storms) and fewer interjections from AIP. - Basil Rathbone disappears in the final third of the film. The color is better. The ending is more melodramatic. A crucial line from A disappears from B, yet a reference to it remains - the Robot John bidding farewell to his creator, Dr. Kerns - a humanizing touch that gives us to wonder about the development of the Robot as a character.Of both versions, what must be said is they remain the only remnants Americans are likely to see of what appears to have been a fine Russian sci-fi film. The original cinematography is B-movie level, but quite good on that basis. The characters are fairly well-developed as individuals, which is surprising for a Russian film of the period. But then, the film develops along the lines of classical Romanticism, rather than the 'socialist realist' aesthetic approved in Russia at the time. The special effects are really not at all bad for the time. The story is one of discovery - of the joy of adventure that was once scientific exploration. I don't know how we lost this, considering that much of the earth's depths and all of outer space remain frontiers, but it is good to see it again, even if only in retrospect.The low rating of this film at IMDb is senseless. Once more young viewers reveal they have little taste and no sense of history. Which means their opinions count for nothing.",positive,movie
133195,"I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I saw the trailer for the first time back in February. I didn't go to see it on the opening night, and then, having read all of the bad reviews here on IMDb, I was pretty put off, fearing that this is one of those movies that don't live up to a great trailer. But I went anyway, and was not disappointed. Maybe I enjoyed it so much because I brought along low expectations, a light mood, and had Haagen Dazs just before the flick. On the bright side, Year One is riddled with humor, some jokes being funnier than others, and yes, as other reviewers have pointed out, some of the jokes are drawn out. Jack Black is admirably suited for the role of the anti-hero Zed, a sort of Judah Friedlander caveman who fails at everything he does, but fails -so well-. And Michael Cera, the effeminate Oh, is another manifestation of wise casting. Who better to play the virgin gatherer than Cera? At times, the movie is not -gripping-, and the trailer is a bit misleading, since it gives the impression that the movie would be mostly about cavemen meeting Romans with few biblical allusions. But the entire movie is nearly a parody about the bible, in which another explanation is offered for some of the miracles of the Old Testament. The moments when the movie is dull are few, and the dialog and characterization make up for it. Zed remains faithful to his inadequate anti-hero character throughout, and Oh keeps getting into worse trouble, as he had since the beginning. This is actually one of the best parts, in which every time Zed gets himself and Oh into trouble, Oh is the one to suffer the worse punishment. In any case, if you want to enjoy this movie, go with a light heart and just try not to take it too seriously.",positive,movie
133300,"The main reason that I wanted to see Hannah Montana the first time was because of Emily Osment, who I am a huge fan of. After I saw it, I was instantly hooked. The story of Miley, aka Hannah Montana, leading her double life in Malibu is touching, funny, and a definite Disney classic. In the role of Miley Stewert is Miley Cyrus, whose acting and singing prove why she was chosen for the leading role. Mitchel Musso and Emily Osment as her two friends Oliver and Lily, respectively, are both riots in their hilarious roles. The directors certainly picked the right people, and the chemistry between these three makes the show worth while. As Miley's dad and brother, Cyrus's real life father plays Robby the dad, while Jason Earles is knock-out hysterical in his role as Jackson the brother. The cast is all awesome, though the shining stars are, in my opinion, Osment, Musso, and Earles. One of my favorite parts about the show is the fact that the dad is not a dumb dad like in so many other TV series. The relationship between Miley and her dad is very cool, and it almost reminds me of my dad and I. TV needs a little more cool dad, like in That's So Raven, instead of dumb dads like Homer Simpson. All in all, Hannah Montana is a great new Disney show. I enjoy it, and I hope you will too.",positive,movie

The company that produced The Grudge 1-3, Ghost House Pictures, makes some of the scariest horror thrillers like The Messengers and 30 Days of Night. I was impressed with the cast, especially teenage newcomer Johanna E. Braddy (Penny Dreadful and FX's The Riches).

133794,"STORAGE 24 is a British indie featuring several friends trapped in a storage facility with a creature on the loose. Complicating matters is a love triangle which will test the bonds of friendship as all work together to survive. A down-to-earth take on ALIEN, this one adds a layer of suspense through its emphasis on character, setting up and defying expectations throughout the proceedings, and surprising us as to who will be our hero. The creature, although realized in part through CGI (always a caution flag for this reviewer), is very effective and satisfying. Like the facility, itself (a clever setting as the characters forage adjoining units for any resource that will aid their plight), this film has scares, emotional depth, and character surprises tucked away for its audience. The leads are Noel Clarke, who recently appeared in Star Trek: Into Darkness and Colin O'Donoghue, known for Once Upon A Time (TV Show) and the underrated, The Rite, where he held his own, opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins).

Clearly people who have not read the books are at somewhat of a disadvantage, but if you watched the series from beginning to Breaking Dawn Part I, then I would definitely not miss this one. It is obvious that Lionsgate's influence on this movie had a positive result and I wish that influence extended to the others, because of Summit's former 'make it cheap' attitude. The books deserved better, because the movies focused more on character relationships and less on an important theme from the books which was you can choose to be a predator, or not and the results of those choices. For me, bringing the books to life was very fun and being an old person, a nice diversion. If you haven't seen the prior movies, or read the books, then I'd skip the movie as it won't make much sense. (Hence a prior review comparing it to X-men. Really?!?!)

Perhaps this humor isn't for everyone but it never occurred to me until now that there would be so many lower ratings. I say this because I most always feel the reviews here at IMDb are right on and rely upon them for my movie going choices. My wife feels the same way about this...very confused at the lower score. Oh well...each to their own as humor is unique to each individual. My recommendation: For anyone considering this movie...if you like Adam Sandler, over the top sexual humor and just plain weird material....see this movie.",positive,movie
134563,"I really loved this movie. I can't wait for it to be released on bluray because I want to add it to my collection.This movie had so much more story and depth and character development compared to it's predecessors.Ultimately, it was a genuinely great story that speaks volumes on the depravity of mankind, the injustices in governments that are run by the elite rich, and the oppression of the lower class (all of which are modern topics of debate).It was beautifully put together, with great acting and a good suspenseful soundtrack. But it also managed to carry the strongest plot out of the trilogy. I liked the way they portrayed the purgers in this movie, because they had the most personality out of all the previous movies, and they demonstrated how evil people really enjoy their work (of purging, especially).But it also shows how a cast of people from so different backgrounds could work together for a common good, and how our differences mean so little when we stand together for something good and right and just.",positive,movie
134621,In the Top Gun genre although without the homo eroticism. But a great performance from Duvall who lights up the screen every time he is on - which is often. Nicole Kidman lights up the screen as well and not just for her acting! Cruise is OK as the foil to Duvall's Harry. Tony Scott's direction is standard for a Bruckenheimer film and deserves applause.The plot is entirely predictable and there is little tension. Like Top Gun the bits in between the action are too long and the sub plot of the injured driver coming to terms with his forced retirement is tedious and contributes little. BUT see this if only for Duvall's flawless performance.,positive,movie

It's Scary, emotional, and terrifying.Sometimes Dead is Better.",positive,movie
134690,"This movie and another one that deals with an expedition that goes to the Red Planet came out about the same time. ""Mission to Mars"" is by far the better of the two. It is very well acted and has many good technical points in it. The only part I didn't like was the accident that befell the relief expedition and the spacewalk after that. Other than that whole scene sequence, the movie was very good. The ending is very emotional. I guess that is why some really hate it or like me love it. The movie really says more about our need to explore than anything else. By reaching out constantly, we assure our survival as a species. It probably disappoints many viewers because it doesn't have monsters or evil people. In this sense it is more realistic. The people that go into space are pros and not likely to go bonkers. It is not as 'dramatic' as some but certainly more satisfying for those of us that see a future for the human race.",positive,movie
134826,"After reading some negative reviews in some magazine I went to the movie with trepidation. Is it a finely crafted film, with a riveting script? No, but it was a good way to enjoy a Sunday afternoon with a friend.Kate Hudson, Gennifer Goodwin do a good job making the friendship believable and warm, which could have been difficult considering their different temperaments. Colin Egglesfield is so handsome and those eyes can make you forgive a someway stiff performance. John Krasinski steals the show though, with his spot on delivery of the best lines in the movie.Be sure to stay until after the credits for a little bonus blip.Hoping they do the next story, John Krasinski would be fabulous.",positive,movie
134860,"I don't know why everybody rips this movie. The special effects are very realistic, down to the pink-tinted Martian sky. The plot is plausible (for science fiction), paying attention to many small details that often make these kinds of movies farcical. Most important, it's very existential; humans simply trying to survive against almost insurmountable odds. As the struggle builds, the relationships begin to gel nicely. This IS a movie about human relationships, not Star Wars style hype. I know, there are some weak spots. The opening and closing dialog, Val Kilmer whispering all the way through, some of the dialog, etc. But overall, this movie doesn't try to do too much (unlike the abysmal Mission To Mars), and that's what makes it a success.",positive,movie
135045,"This is one of the best sequels to Steven Seagal. Under Siege 2: Dark Territory is not your ordinary hijack-action-adventure films. Since I do like trains, this movie was a plus for me. The part in this film was everyone, including Ryback(Seagal) got to be part of the action. His niece Sarah, played by Katherine Heigl, knew how to fight back. Bobby Zachs, played by Morris Chestnut, didn't shy away from the action, unless he saw Ryback kill one of the hijackers. The funny part was when one of the female passengers flashed her cleavage saying she ""broke her bra"", the perfect distraction to the hijacker. Great cast, great action, and a great plot I say. I don't care for the critics' opinion, I just liked this movie the way it is! Rating 3 out of 5 stars. 8 out of 10!",positive,movie
135177,"I went to see this movie with a few friends. Lets just say, it was unanimous, we loved it! All the actors and actresses in the movie were portraying their characters realistically, even Sara Paxton's character as a mermaid! And, dang is Ray FINE! Haha. The movie just had some certain quality about it that really appealed to me and my friends. Although some people gave it a review saying it was childish, its for KIDS! WE loved it and it also had a similar message as The Princess Bride. True love can mean more than anything else. It was funny, sweet and light-hearted. You might not want to bring young kids though. it was really fun to watch, and we had a great time, and if I saw this movie as an adult, it might have been a bit girlish, yeah, but girls will love it like heck!",positive,movie
135230,"A typical modern-day comedy so some of its crudeness with sexual innuendos or remarks, but overall this is a full notch or two above most because underneath it is a soft, good- hearted feel to it. It's also a nice vehicle for a positive image to be presented for mentally- challenged people (formerl called ""retards""). Those guys are as much of stars in this film as actors Johnny Knoxville and Katherine Heigl. Knoxville plays the main character, ""Steve Barker,"" a guy for (for good reasons, if that's possible) fakes being ""handicapped"" and enters The Special Olympics. He is hoping to win a big monetary prize to help pay for a friend's surgery and to help out his degenerate uncle who could be killed if he doesn't pay gamblers what he owes. Brian Cox plays ""Uncle Gary."" Both the man who needs the surgery (""Stavi,"" played by Luis Avalos) and Cox are hilarious in their roles, one being sympathetic and the other sleazy.Along the way, Knoxville falls in love with Special Olympics worker ""Lynn Sheridan"" (Heigl). Hey, who wouldn't? This woman is unbelievably attractive and plays a good-hearted character.Most of the funny lines in the movie are delivered by the Special Olympics athletes. Unrealistic? Yes, credibility is not high in that regard as as 99.9 percent of all the world's population would't be clever enough to deliver some of these lines but they are a hoot to hear. The fact you hear them uttered by ""mentally-challenged"" folks makes it even more outrageous and funny, of course. I can't remember how many times I just laughed out loud at something being said.And, the film ends on a nigh note despite our hero being discovered as a fraud. The whole story is just a lot of a fun and is truly a feel-good film when it's all over. Highly recommended, but not for small kids because of the language.",positive,movie
135331,"The Skulls is a very intense movie that keeps the watcher interested. This movie does not really have many qualities that would qualify it is an award-winner, but over all the movie is very interesting and is Definitely worth watching at least once. The deleted scenes included on the DVD are also worth watching, but you understand why they were cut. Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker were both very sharp in this movie, but some of the acting was a little poor. Through out the movie some flaws or holes could be found, yet all-in-all they did not affect the story line very much. In general The Skulls is an entertaining movie and I would recommend it.",positive,movie
135699,"The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) is, in my opinion, one of the best spoofs in movie history. Every character is deliciously well done in true '70s style, the decor is excellent, and the whole plot is hilarious: the Bradys in the '90s. An excellent movie on the whole, complete with cameos by the original Brady Bunch cast and '70s icons.The beauty of this movie, has I've mentioned before, is that it is done so authentically. There are little touches here and there (you may need to watch the movie a few times to notice), such as 'The Partridge Family' bus going by just before the singing competition scene.There are some hilarious moments (some quite cringe worthy too!). Mike Brady giving a 'wise' speech, Marcia getting hit in the nose by a football, Marcia's dance and so many more. I even find when Jan knocks some boxes off funny! Pacing wise, it moves very fast so you don't get bored. It runs smoothly. No qualms there.It is really amusing to see a naive, sweet '70s family fit in with '90s California grunge. It's a great movie - many great memories of this.",positive,movie
135970,"Jim Carrey is a wonder actor. His performance in the box-office blockbuster 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is worth immense praise. The Golden-Globe Award Winner delivers hilariously in this slapstick-comedy, that is full of double-meaning jokes & over-the-top sequences. As a film, it works and manages some truly funny moments, but it's Carrey who makes this film a must watch.'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective': Synopsis: A goofy detective specializing in animals, goes in search of a missing dolphin mascot of a football team. 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is meant for those who like slapstick-comedies. This cult-classic is not meant for the pseudo intellectuals at all. Reason? The Over-The-Top sequences, and the unexpected digs at transsexuals, will surely not attract them. I, how-ever, had a good laugh and I mainly credit Carrey for it. He is fantastic as the Ace Ventura and in many ways, he immortalizes him. In terms of screenplay, there is not much to say, apart from the fact, that it is true to the genre it follows. Tom Shadyac's Direction captures Ace Ventura's journey, most convincingly. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design & Costume Design, are worth a mention. On the whole, Watch it, but only, if you have the stomach for it.",positive,movie

While there may be small details to niggle at for the most die-hard Burroughs fans, this is ""inspired by"" a Princess of Mars, it isn't a straight adaptation. The movie is a whirlwind of amazing visuals, powerful dialog and soul-wrenching storytelling.I'd had high hopes that this movie would live up to the hype surrounding it. It surpasses it, the hype doesn't even come close. From beginning to end, this movie focuses on story, and expands on a great story with stunning effects as opposed to just using great FX in place of solid storytelling.It also has one of the strongest pieces of non-verbal storytelling outside of Up.Do not miss this film. Do see it in the theaters. Do see it in 3D.You will not be disappointed.

136536,"I really enjoyed SCREAM because I thought it was a very original horror movie. I liked SCREAM 2 for the same reason. The story line is pretty much the same as in SCREAM, but I thought the acting, characters, and death scenes were all better.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has gone off to college to become and actress. Now that she has left her past behind her, she is doing better. She has a new best friend/roommate named Hallie (Elise Neal), a new boyfriend and a new life. But when somebody starts killing people in the same style of the killer, Sidney finds out that her past has come back to haunt her. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), old prime suspect proven innocent of the murder of Sidney's mom from SCREAM, returns to try and get publicity for his part in all of this. Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) returns as the movie expert and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) return to try and protect Sidney.The plot is pretty much the same as SCREAM, but instead of poking fun of horror movies, they poke fun at sequels. When the college students argue about whether sequels can be better than the original, it's priceless.The acting is even better in this movie than in SCREAM. Neve Campbell does her usual teriffic job. David Arquette and Courtney Cox are even better in SCREAM 2 than they are in SCREAM. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jada Pinkett are the equivilant of Drew Barrymore in SCREAM. They both do fair jobs, especially Sarah. Liev Schreiber and Jamie Kennedy do great jobs, and Roger L. Jackson returns at the bitchin' phone voice. (By the way, in a movie full of the biggest teenage stars of today, Joshua Jackson has a good cameo.)The character development is even better in SCREAM. You will, once again, find yourself screaming at the characters to run and get away. Sidney and Gale are just as cool as they were in the first one. Dewey and Randy are both extremely better characters in this one than in SCREAM. In SCREAM, Randy was annoying and an almost pointless character. In SCREAM 2, he's my favorite. The addition of Cotton Weary in this movie is suberb.I thought SCREAM 2 was better than SCREAM. Most people will think it is just as good or almost as good as SCREAM. If you didn't like SCREAM, don't bother watching SCREAM 2. But if you, like me, enjoyed SCREAM, this is a must-see.",positive,movie
136630,"Rampage (4.5 out of 5 stars).Video game adaptations into films have been ongoing with a curse from missing a specific target audience. Resident Evil's are not great films but have been entertaining with its action. The new Tomb Raider reboot was surprisingly good but could have been more. And there are other lacklusters like Prince of Persia, Doom, Silent Hill, ect. A movie about three giant monsters of a crocodile, gorilla, and a grey wolf causing a mass destruction in a city. Yes, that is what the arcade games are about and that is exactly what you can expect in this Rampage film. At least, it is one hell of a wild ride of fun. So don't expect any award winning script with great dialogue, a long developing story, or logic with characters choices in the movie. If you leave all the critical thinking out before watching the film, you will find the film to be what it is. And it does its job, which is entertaining and being a lot of fun. The plot follows after a science experiment gone wrong in space leaving three canisters to fall on Earth. A primatologist Davis (Dwayne Johnson) notices one of his gorilla friend George is infected with and a lot bigger. After his agitation and escape from the Zoo. The government agent Harvey (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) captures George and tries to take him into a more secured location. Meanwhile, a corporation that was in charge of the space station experiment of genetic editing led by Claire (Malin Akerman) and her brother Brett (Jake Lacy) tries to send a signal to bring in the giant gorilla and the other two infected beasts of a giant grey wolf and a mutated crocodile. The film is a lot of fun. It has a lot of action and big set pieces. It is loud, big, and dumb. But it is definitely a film of escapism of watching three giant beasts destroying a city. While the military are giving everything they got to stop them. And Davis and Dr. Kate (Naomie Harris) are trying to find a solution to get George back and to have the giant gorilla stop the other two beasts. The visual effects are awesome. There may be some cheesy cgi with the military jets or watching Dwayne Johnson running through falling buildings and avoiding a lot of heavy debris while the monsters are battling it out. Dwayne Johnson is becoming one of the actors you enjoy watching on screen. If you either like his big tough attitude responses or enjoy him facing the impossible with the action sequences. Naomie Harris was okay playing a sidekick character with Davis. Malin Akerman and Jake Lacy play cheesy villains of a cliché corporation on wanting to create deadly experiments for there own personal gain. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was a lot of fun playing a cowboy attitude government agent. (Almost feels like he was playing the same character as Negan from The Walking Dead series). Director Brad Peyton created a wild ride with San Andreas film. He does the same with Rampage. It is big and loud and action packed. From an exciting sequence with mercenaries fighting with a giant wolf in the forest to George's escape on the plane. And the final half hour climax of three monsters causing mass destruction. Also, there is some fun humor. And George and Davis friendship does try to build an emotional connection with the gorilla that tries to have you rooting for the beast. Overall, Rampage is a really good film. It is action packed throughout. The visual effects are awesome. The characters are fun and cheesy. The plot and concept is everything you can expect for a blockbuster fun of monsters causing destructions. I recommend seeing this film on the big screen in theatres. If you are looking for a blockbuster escapism of big action and mass destruction. And seeing Dwayne Johnson battle through this destruction. This would be the film to check out. It is a lot of fun.",positive,movie
136646,"I seriously don't understand why this movie is getting such bad reviews. If you're a die hard Jack Reacher fan then you're gonna love this movie. If you're a fan of action movies in general then you'll certainly like it. It's got all the right things in place. Great action, solid performances, a decent soundtrack and a shitload of ass-kicking the Reacher way. Seriously this movie is pretty damn good.It is quite different from the first one too. The first one was a quiet and slow thriller. This one's completely opposite. Which isn't a bad thing. It's always throwing something at you, both good and bad, necessary and unnecessary. It's loud and brutal and wants to be heard and demands your attention but doesn't really reward you for it.The performances are great. Cruise is Cruise and is as great as ever. His height didn't bother me at all and his solid and brutal performance more than made up for it. Coincidentally he and Reacher turned 54 this year. It was always great to see him on screen and especially great to watch him kick some ass. But the highlight here was Cobie Smulders. She absolutely stole the show and left me quite impressed. She was as good as last year's Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust in Mission Impossible Rogue Nation.The villain was a little flat. He was intimidating at times but overall the whole villain factor in the movie wasn't all that great. The rest of the cast worked with what they had and the chemistry between them felt a little sloppy at times and even forced. But its not a perfect movie. No way. Its got it's share of flaws.The most notable one would be the change in the director. Edward Zwick does his best to fill the gap Christopher McQuarrie left but fails to do so. The movie would have been a lot better with McQuarrie on board. The story was weak and incoherent at times. The villains lacked motive and there were plenty of things that were left unexplained at the end.Overall I'd say that if you stop nitpicking, you're going to find a fun and thrilling movie which is worth every buck.",positive,movie

I found myself glued to a spell-binding splendor on screen that cinema has sorely needed for so many years.Both Kidman and Jackman seemed to equally put as much as is possible into their parts. She was truly funny and yet serious as her character demanded. She has never been any better in anything I have seen(that does not include Far and AWay because I have not seen it). He, too, was funny and yet every bit as hard and serious as you would hope a man in his position would be. Both have their weak moments that drew more than a few tears from me.Baz showed how great a story teller he is by using all the hooks he can think of. Magic, music, love, memories, anger, fear, hate, awe and hope fill this movie as much as the natural beauty of Australia fills the screen. Don't think for one moment there was no soft imaging or CGI because there was when it was needed. Oh, and thanks for not letting Nicole sing the whole song. That was a wise choice. I think her voice is fine, I just think ""that"" song was not meant to be sung by anyone in the movie.Thank you, Baz, for such a memorable work of art.

Archie, Jughead and the rest of the gang have been updated and dropped into the ""real"" world both in the comics and now on television. I was never much of an Archie fan, leaning more towards the superhero and horror genres when I was younger, but I was aware of Archie on the periphery of my comic book reading habits. Occasionally I'd read a book or two but they never struck me as something I wanted to read regularly. So when this series was announced I went in with a little bias and actually didn't want to like it. I had too many shows competing for my time as it was. But I decided to give it a shot. I wanted to see what this updated, teen drama Archie had to offer. Immediately, with the murder mystery I started getting a Rob Thomas Veronica Mars vibe from it and that is not a bad thing. Riverdale was suddenly layered and mysterious, yet still filled with characters you knew from Archie and Betty, to Pops and the Pussycats. These were people you could identify with with actual personalities beyond the pulp four color comic book world you remember them from. And they were eyeball deep in a mystery that had real consequences. And we got to learn about not just the ""gang"", but also their parents and some periphery characters that were rarely touched on in the comics. And best of all, the goofy sidekick Jughead is a much more interesting character and the narrator of the series showing him to be an intelligent person far beyond the hamburger munching cartoon of a character he is in the books.I have just finished the season finale and look forward to the next season. It far exceeded my expectations.",positive,movie
136944,"I just saw Hostage today at an advanced screening and I liked it! It seems to have all the elements of the Bruce Willis action movie, so one might think it cannot surprise anymore. Then again, you rarely see a bad Bruce Willis movie. It has the opening failure of the perfect cop, and the almost ""post traumatic stress"" side to the character who then moves into a smaller town, but carries his burden along with him.But this time, Bruce Willis doesn't seem all that perfect, he is scared, his voice is shaking in several situations and even cries. He still saves the day, but he's a lot more... human. And the guy is pretty good at this, too.Then there are the really powerful scenes that shake your soul! Young actor Ben Foster is involved in many of them and does a terrific (literally and figuratively speaking) job! There are also some unexpected resolutions and some even less expected symbolic shots.Bottom line is, Hostage is a good pick not only for the action/thriller fan, but also for any movie goer.",positive,movie
136984,After Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman. Yesterday is the next movie based on the classic song sang by a classic musicians. But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman which are biography movies. Yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two. Did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint. After seeing the first trailer back in February I was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie.The plot for the movie centers around Jack Malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about 12 seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the Beatles.The movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels. The performances by Himesh Patel and Lily James was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie. I thought Ed Sheeran wasn't that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than I expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad. The movie featured lots of classic Beatles which was great even though Let It Be was on briefly I was expecting a full version of the record in the movie. But that didn't ruin the whole movie. The ending of movie was very moving and emotional don't going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending.Overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but didn't deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the Beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema.

137105,"After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",positive,movie
137187,"Licence to Kill is directed by John Glen and written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. It's an original story that uses characters and instances created by Ian Fleming. It stars Timothy Dalton, Carey Lowell, Robert Davi, Talisa Soto, Anthony Zerbe, Desmond Llewelyn, David Hedison, Benicio Del Toro, Frank McRae, Everett McGill and Wayne Newton. Music is scored by Michael Kamen and cinematography by Alec Mills.Bond 16 and 007 goes rogue when drug baron Franz Sanchez leaves Felix Leiter mutilated and his wife dead. With licence revoked by MI6, Bond has to go it alone to enact revenge for the Leiters.The controversial Bond for many reasons, Licence to Kill even today has been known to induce fearsome arguments in Bond fan circles. Not since On Her Majesty's Secret Service has a Bond film so polarised opinions. In one corner are the folks who determine it's not a Bond movie, in the other is those who say it's a stripped to the bone human Bond. You either love it or you hate it it seems. True to say that it is more an action thriller than a outright Bond film, no humongous sets, no megalomaniac villain (Davi's drug baron a very realistic menace) and of course there is Bond being pursued by those that have courted him previously as their number one agent. Yet there's a whole raft of scenarios that could only exist in a Bond universe, there's gadgets, too, for those that enjoy that side of Bond. Where else would you see a tanker driving on its side? Or exploding toothpaste and alarm clock, camera's that turn into weapons and a broom that is actually a transmitter? Not Bondian enough? Really?Licence to Kill is a superior action thriller movie, the script is tight, the cast ace and the picture is crammed full of exceptional action set pieces. From the pre-credits sequence that sees Bond and Leiter enact a mid-air arrest, to the rather brilliant tanker carnage at the finale, the film rarely pauses for breath, and right there in the centre is a brilliant Dalton giving a rogue Bond plenty of layers. He's brainy and classy, fallible and driven, intense and tough, always sexy and always dangerous. Dalton's ability to convey raw emotion as each challenge comes his way is a real treat to watch. But most of all he is right there restoring Bond to being a serious action figure. What Bond fans didn't realise at the time was that it would be 17 years before Bond would be this raw again, then it would be heralded as a brave new start for Bond!Another of the film's strengths is bringing back Hedison as Leiter, last seen playing the role in Live and Let Die, Hedison has great chemistry with Dalton and it's a joy to see Leiter play an active part in the action on screen. However, the makers do make a misstep by having Leiter be all too jovial at the end of the film, weird since he is minus a limb and his wife was raped and murdered by Sanchez's henchmen. Another big plus is Lowell's Pam Bouvier, a tough and brave Bond girl, sexy as heck, her pilot skills come in handy and she's no mug when it comes to brawling. Lowell does fine work in the role and keeps it away from being a token interest cliché. Davi keeps Sanchez as believable, a very driven drug baron who is cultured and funny, but always pulsing a vicious streak, while McRae has presence, McGill neatly keeps the cards close to his chest, Del Toro a nice line in nastiness and Soto is pretty as a picture and plays Lupe Lamora with skilled vulnerability. And of course there's Llewelyn as Q, who here gets a right old meaty role as he goes out in the field to become Bond's only aid from MI6. Again, not Bondian enough?Licence to Kill saw the end of Dalton's tenure as Bond, legal issues between Danjaq and MGM/UA meant that no Bond movie would be made for another six years. By then Dalton had moved on to other work and was 51. It also marked the end of production duties for Cubby Broccoli, the final direction by John Glen (5 Bond films in total), Richard Maibaum's last script and the last performances by Robert Brown as M and Caroline Bliss as Moneypenney. One of the many misconceptions about the Dalton era is that Licence to Kill was a flop, it made $156 million worldwide, considerably down on The Living Daylights but more than A View to a Kill. A huge profit of over $100 million, this in spite of it being pitched against Batman and sequels to beloved American films by a studio head who had no idea how to market a film. The best actor to take on the role of Bond, Dalton's impact on the series cannot be overstated, he (rightly so) is very proud of his work in the two films and still talks very fondly of a role he respected beyond compare. 9/10",positive,movie
137265,"Funny Games is not your average horror movie. It is about a family that gets terrorized by a two nihilistic men who just want to torture them for fun. Many people will see this and think that the movie is just ""torture porn"", but it is much more. Haneke has created a movie that is disturbing in many ways. One is the fact that Haneke is daring us to see this movie. He is telling us to come and sit through the most disturbing, nihilistic, and perverse movie that he has ever made. The trailer does make this movie look fun, but it is a total joke to get you to see the movie. Another disturbing thing about the movie is the story itself. These two nihilistic men just want to go as far as they can to make us, the audience, suffer. Yet, we suffer in a different way. The suffering is not like Saw or Hostel movies, but totally different. We get tortured and abused because of how much we want to see violence. He gives us the violence and makes us go through with the pain. Funny Games does torture us, but in a way that we have never been tortured or abused before. And for that, this movie is a unique and stylish horror movie.",positive,movie
137319,"Attending a screening of the movie ""Monsters"" earlier this evening, i knew a little about the movie itself, only reading that people compare it to Cloverfield and District 9.Someone even told me, that it had similarities with Stephen King/Frank Darabont's The Mist, and that's understandable as well.I agree with the people, claiming the movie looked a lot like D9, but in aspects, different from the plot.Well, the big idea is the same, but as the movie progresses and the picture unfolds, you'll see that the only thing incommon was the quality of both movies...and well, the aliens.On the other hand, the difference for me is sky high, and, although i liked D9, i lowered the rate, because of some over gored scenes and mindless action at some moments.There were no emotions as well.And those things i liked in Monsters-there was friendship growing into romance, growing into love, there was intensity and a little bit of action too, and the sets and SFX's were just amazing and brilliantly crafted as well, considering the fact the budget was around 15 000 $ .And that's the most amazing part-the movie had the effects and quality of a movie, at least 1000 times more expensive.That's why some people claim, that Gareth Edwards is the new Neill Blomkamp.The atmosphere is very real, convincing, pulling you in the story, the sets were breathtaking as well.I don't know how he did those things, but that's an incredible achievement.And talking about achievements, i must say, the cast in the sight of the two leads, was just amazing.Such actors are real treasures, because they don't wait for a million dollars to hit them, and then, maybe, start acting.They did the job perfectly, even though the scale of the project was small...at first.They were very convincing and built up an incredible atmosphere.The chemistry was obvious here.You begin to care about them, so all the guts and gore (like in D9) become unnecessary, because you feel bounded to them and whenever they're in trouble and a dangerous situation occurs, you feel the tension rising, and when you care about them, all the explosions and gore in the world won't be needed and in fact, that's not even the spirit of the movie.It's a tension build up, one step at a time.And that's what's giving the actors the freedom they need, to show their talent and acting skills.And Whitney Able and Scoot McNairy were the prefect actors for the on-screen leading couple.A bigger actor just wouldn't fit in to the situation.For example, try picturing Ali Larter or Brendan Fraser, or, whoever you want in this.It just wouldn't be good enough and fitting enough.That's why i give such a credit to the leads.They were unique.And last, but not least, i must pay attention to the other strengths and weaknesses of the movie.Although obvious, the plot kept throwing new obstacles at the leads and at the viewers, making the ride even more entertaining.The title is good but the ones, who are going in for the Sci-Fi action and gore-that's not the movie for you.The title may be misleading for some, but seeing the trailers or at least a poster, one'll know what is needed, before seeing it.The editing, sound, cinematography were all top-notch and i hope some nominations may come on the path of the movie.Overall, high quality, good directed, and shot low-budget movie, led by two incredibly well fitting actors and you have a masterpiece out of nowhere!!!Highly recommended! See it at the movies or buy the DVD when it comes out.I give the movie the full grade, considering i liked it more than D9 and D9 was almost great.My grade: 10/10Edit: The last scene was very strong and a little upsetting, especially for the main characters...but i won't ruin it for you.You can choose what you want to believe in...",positive,movie
137344,"TIDBIT - Bette Midler was the original choice for the lead in ""Sister Act"".That may have been cute (a Jewish nun?) but in choosing Whoopi, ""Sister Act"" gives itself a shot in the arm with an incomparable comic talent and insures every scene with Deloris/Mary Clarence is a highlight unto itself. 
After witnessing a Mob hit courtesy of her boyfriend (Keitel), casino lounge singer Whoopi hightails it to her local police where a helpful cop (Nunn) puts her in the Witness Protection Program and before you can say ""holy, holy, holy"", sends her to the last place in the world anyone would think of finding a second-rate lounge singer. Once the church, nuns and choir music with a Motown beat are all introduced, things pick up steadily.  All the nuns are funny (especially Najimy as the eternally sunny Sister Mary Patrick) and there are so many good scenes to be had thereafter (the bar scene, the first choir practice, the blossoming of Sister Mary Robert (Makkenna), etc.), that you can't help but smile, even if you're tired of nuns as a springboard for comedy.  And there's something about the music: the gospel-tinged soul songs like ""My God"", ""I Will Follow Him"" and such lift your spirits and are infectious in their own right.  The last scene in the movie is quite moving, truth be told, and lets you in on a secret... God moves in mysterious ways.Amen.Nine stars.  These ""Sister""s rock!",positive,movie
137424,"It takes a considerable amount of skill to direct what is being advertised and I suppose in strict genre terms *is* a horror film (though I'd claim in the pendulum it swings more towards drama or thriller than horror, but I'll get to why it can be considered the 'H' thing soon enough). It takes someone though with guts and confidence to take a trope and to not only take it seriously but try one's damndest to revitalize it. The dream sequence is what I'm referring to, and horror movies and thrillers for so many years get lured into the easy ideal of, 'well, time for a character to have a dream and we'll make it look like the character is REALLY going through with this or what they're seeing and then BOOM, it's scare time!' If you want the cheapest of examples of this, Siskel & Ebert had a good highlight of one such dream 'gotcha' set piece in Jaws 4 of all things, but I digress.Trey Edward Shults gives his... do we call Travis the protagonist? I suppose so, considering we see so much through his perspective, but we do see his dreams. But this isn't a filmmaker going out of his/her way to make scares to mess with the audience; this is about the character first and foremost, that it's about what Travis is experiencing in that house that is full of, what one might call one of Travis's drawings that he makes, deep/dark values, not even shadows but simply the black abyss that makes up most of the house at night, and because what he's seeing and hearing and feeling, whether he's in that long hallway that leads up to the blood-red door (even from the trailer that door did enough to sell me on seeing the movie), or if he's outside and we're only looking at his face hearing a dog bark, or if he sees his dead grandparent, we're meant to be there WITH him. And Shults reclaims the dream sequence for a horror movie and makes it vital and more than a gimmick; it's part of the whole experience.Indeed the title may refer to how Travis sees things at night, when he's there in his bedroom or his special crawl-space attic listening in on the newcomers, Will, Kim and Andrew, as they talk or make love or, later on, when something bad is happening. Certainly the ""it"" doesn't really refer to the virus (let's call it 'Son-of-Captain-Trips' for all intents and purposes), as that can come at any time really. With the exception of Sarah, who I found underdeveloped, this is also a horror movie where the people feel like real people, and how you might imagine those in a high-pressure, hopeless situation would act around one another. We know things will likely boil to a head somehow, but Shults does a good job in his script keeping us guessing, and not in a contrived way; this could go the bloody route, this could go the 'love triangle' route (to put it another way, Keough and Harrison Jr have good chemistry together in their brief time one on one), or it could go somewhere else, like maybe we're told more about the virus or what led to this apocalypse. This last part Shults is least interested in. In a way there's a small undercurrent here, barely spoken but present, of many independent films where characters are in the woods somewhere and they... mostly talk, and that's it. Character Study Central.But It Comes at Night is more ambitious within its tight dimensions, and it's especially in look that this film is a must see on a big screen; the cinematography is, like many of the films A24 has picked up in its astonishing run of distributed product, presented in such a way that you're always on your toes, always meant to be in suspense, but genuinely so. Even when things seem cool or calm, or when those few times Shults goes for a montage showing some passage of time like Will and Kim getting adjusted to everyone else, the way the film is shot is unique and lends itself to adding the intrigue. On the way home from seeing the film, my wife commented that more horror movies should take a cue from this, that it's really not that difficult to simply *try* a little more, to not go for the easy and the lazy all the time.I agreed with her in theory, yet I think a film like this, or last year's Green Room or to a degree The Witch, takes someone with vision and a sense of not going the usual path (or Edgerton, who produced it, also has an eye on such independents throughout his career too). The only drawback or... I shouldn't say it like that, more just an observation, is that where this all leads to is a stone-cold bummer. This isn't to say the quality of the film suffers, it's only that one leaves It Comes at Night completely drained. I dare not say why that is, but I did kind of hope that Shults could've left the door open for something not so wholly sour by the end of it all. It's art, it's haunting, and it's depressing as all get out. But at least there's those dreams/nightmares to keep us engaged.",positive,movie
137745,"Arrival is the best sci-fi film I've seen in my 22-year-old lifespan. I haven't seen certain sci-fi films like They Live, Alien 3, or Metropolis, so I can speak only from the standpoint of someone who watches a shitload of narrative, documentary and experimental films. Some of my recent favorites are Holy Motors (2012), Son of Saul (2015), and The Look of Silence (2015).I just saw Arrival two days ago at the Telluride Film Fest and everyone in the theater had their brains cheesed out at various points in the film. For people paying close attention to every frame, the rules of the film might become clear in the beginning sequences. For an Average Joe moviegoer like me, the film is a slow, natural process of discovery from the first scene to the last. The influences of Stanley Kubrick on science fiction films has been noted time after time, but Arrival picks up its Kubrick vibes with it's slow sense of discovery, even if Amy Adams and her technology moves around the screen more frantically than 2001: A Space Odyssey. That's why I respect this film and also why I like 10 Cloverfield Lane. A lot of sci-fi films (like the new Star Trek released this summer) don't create that unfolding sense of science/alien-related mystery. The way information is revealed and presented leaves us begging for more answers, and boy does Arrival deliver. Oscar-worthy for sure, especially in production design/special effects/sound. Don't blow it, go see it November 11th or whenever it's coming to your town. Bring earplugs.Just kidding.But seriously.",positive,movie
137959,"YES! Finally a good no-nonsense Cruise starrer action thriller. No lovey-dovey stuff like the last one, no attempts to show how charismatic Ethan Hunt is neither are there any obvious attempts to portray how cool he is. A good old action movie with Tom Cruise doing what he is known for best: Action! This one's got everything an action thriller could ask for; guns, flying fists, explosions, cool gadgets, sexy cars, the occasional unanticipated startles, hot chicks, sandstorms, jumping off tall buildings (I think jumping off tall things has always been an MI trademark), also the very much needed occasional comic relief, very occasional (which is good). And this one actually has a decent enough story!Every single actor in the movie has acted brilliantly. Paula Patton was very natural in her acting, Simon Pegg (the Hot Fuzz guy) was hilarious as usual with his well timed one liners and Jeremy Renner was surprisingly good! (all 3 part of Ethan Hunts team). Not to mention Anil Kapoor!Oh and Anil Kapoor! Obviously he has been the talk of town for this movie. His character in the movie and his acting (however little its duration) has been spot on and he delivers on the character. His part in the movie will certainly be one of the highlights when you leave the theater. Oh and the portrayal of Mumbai has been quite unique indeed.I won't spill the beans on the story but I am sure you know the gist of it from the trailers, a certain KABOOM'ing of the Kremlin puts Ethan Hunt in a tough spot and he is being chased down by Russians for something he hasn't done, so he needs to set it right and the only way he can do that is by starring in this awesome movie.All in all Ghost Protocol is hands down the best one yet from the Mission Impossible series mainly because it is different from its predecessors (thank GOD for that). It is jam packed with action from the very first scene till the last and is filled with insane stunts, gadgets, car chases (sweet ones). It is fast paced and has a good enough story with a script that will keep you in the loop. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout and not give you a seconds stare away from the screen. The audience actually went ""what? Not NOW!"" when the interval screen came up! Yes, it was THAT good.Well done Cruise.",positive,movie
137968,"'American Hustle'. A amazingly entertaining and engaging experience. A successful (in my opinion) juxtaposition of art and entertainment. A wonderfully acted and directed film.Full disclosure: I loved both 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Linings Play', plus the cast are some of my favourite actors working in motion pictures today. So, I went in with a bias and a high level of anticipation for this film. This can sometimes work against you as a viewer as your expectations are too higher and you are disappointed with the results.I can say that I was not disappointed and absolutely loved the film. People take different experiences and sensibilities with them when they see movies, and mine led me to be engaged and empathetic towards the characters. Their story interested me and I came out of the cinema thoroughly enjoying myself.My only criticism is that it felt it lacked a little something with story. After seeing the film I did read that a lot of the film was improvised and Christian Bale commented to David O'Russell that this would change the story. His response was that he cared about the characters more than the story (paraphrasing). On reflection this is evident as the characters and acting are first class.I by no means acclaim this to be a perfect movie or the best movie ever made, but it worked for me. I loved it!",positive,movie
138092,"It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's ""worst"" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the ""comic book"" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me. As for the score, I am more than willing to argue that this is, hands down, James Newton Howard's best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It's very powerful, but not over-the-top and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack, check out 'The Orange Man' and 'Visions'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word ""powerful"". Yeah, he's no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island, alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky and/or boring direction, but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan's writing is done that way. ('…I see dead people…' '...They call me Mr. Glass…' etc. etc.) Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe, to a certain extent, that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be 'developed' in some way. These theories are, in a way, intertwined with some aspects of psychology, such as selective attention and self-actualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas, let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short, I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers, but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. From a psychological point of view, Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients (osteogenesis imperfecta). He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson's character. Elijah, is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah's breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me, like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film, that'd be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year, or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for, but it definitely sits well with me.",positive,movie
138170,"As far as franchise films go, The Fast and Furious series seem to be hitting the ground at top gear, with this installment not showing signs of slowing down, but prepping a new direction for future films to take, shifting gears from a film showcasing hot bodies (not solely just car chassis) and fast nox-enabled cars into the classic heist genre, given that it had that as its underlying premise from the first film, and now with a growing ensemble, are ready to give Ocean's Eleven a run for its money.Rio De Janeiro provides the backdrop in which this installment takes place in (quite a popular location for films recently too), with the chief villain being Reyes (Joaquim de Almedia), a mobster with a businessman front, with his tentacles of vice and influence extending toward every part of the city. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the former's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) hide out in the city as fugitives having broken Dom en route to prison at the end of Fast and Furious, and with the kind of money available for the taking to start a family of their own with Mia found to be pregnant, they decide to assemble a team, not to pass up the opportunity of robbing Reyes blind.So in comes a whole host of characters whom we have seen in past films, such as Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Gisele (Gal Gadot), and even Han (Sung Kang) whom we know what happened to in Tokyo Drift, hence putting the chronology of the films at 1, 2, 4, 5 and 3, which is now sometime in the not so immediate future. Director Justin Lin takes on his 3rd film of the franchise and together with writer Chris Morgan have managed to introduce new elements to surprise audiences and fans up until this installment, keeping with the usual action laden elements, while bringing on new characters into the franchise, this time with Dwayne Johnson coming in as a no nonsense, dogged and persistent FBI operative Hobbs, with an arsenal of technology and attitude to aid him and his team in tracking down Dom and his crew.And of course who cannot wait to see two tough guys in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson go one on one with each other in a fisticuffs, especially since their time with family friendly films have taken a backseat to put them both firmly back into the action genre. It sets up new rivalry, while keeping the old between Dominic and Brian with the latter always keen to prove who's the better driver. And like most ensemble films, it's make or break given the character's appeal, and I'm glad to note they share this incredibly chemistry this bunch of highly skilled cons who each bring their know-how to the table in trying to pull off mission frickin' insanity, and everyone possessing a mean driver's license to power souped up vehicles.And if it's action you're seeking, it's action you'll get in this film too, putting aside the rather rote and superficial theme of family and trust. There's no lack of races and wheels on the roads although I do note that there's not too much of signature cars to go around this time. Even a would be street race was unceremoniously cut off, although we do get it compensated with a four way race down two traffic lights amongst Roman, Dom, Brian and Han which was more of a fair competition since they were all essentially driving the same model. Then there's the big bang finale that you would have seen in the trailer, with Dom and Brian yanking a bank vault and travelling down the streets of Rio at top speed, in what would be a fittingly noisy last act destroying everything, and I mean everything, along their path, that has to be seen in a cinema to enjoy this guilt trip in sense surround glory. Needless to say I am a fan of the franchise, and am excited about the direction this film would be going even if it would mean limiting the number of cars on the roads, since the film had already shown the potential of that chemistry between the cast and characters, and I'm eagerly anticipating more. From one fanboy and an action junkie to any other, this of course would be recommended fare. Stay tuned while the end credits roll, and you'll be treated to a stinger that reaffirms and teases what's to come in the next film, with no less than two surprise appearances. But no, with the timeline, it'll take a while before Lucas Black will be able to link up with the guys.

138376,"I can watch this film over and over. Not only because I am so terribly interested in the exploration of space and the historical events that have taken place - but because it's a great film with excellent performances and a truth-telling style. Heck, even Lovell's wife dropping the wedding ring in the shower the day of the launch is true!Just the fact that this film is true makes it even more enjoyable. It's hard to understand how in the hell one can make it back to Earth and survive with a fatally crippled space-craft. It's even harder to appreciate just how close they actually got to dying out there.The performances are astounding. Ed Harris is just stupendous as Gene Krantz, and Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Garty Sinise and Bill Paxton (who seems to always get the role as the whiner...) are also great.As Hanks put it: this story is one of the greatest ever.

138437,"Just watched it on blu-ray. I'm not an expert on the source material, I never read much of the comic books, but I was encouraged by some of the reviews here. So I bought it at a discount, watched it, and...I love it. No, it's not a masterpiece. No brilliance in the story, no $200M effects budget, no complex characters. Instead, it reeks of testosterone. It smells like victory. It tastes like the good old times of Robocop and Die Hard. It feels totally uncompromised and rare in today's cinema.I like the simple construct of this movie. When ""Dredd"" begins, you're thrown straight into the story. When the story ends, the movie ends too, no hugs or aftermath. The setting is somewhat contained, smallish in scale and makes the movie intense. The small effects budget is used well, practical visual effects mixed with CGI in an interesting manner. The uniforms are wonderful and the world is bleak in just the right way. This simple story is well-paced and never gets boring. Also, ""Dredd"" doesn't pretend to be anything else, anything more than it is. It's honest and uncompromising, It's merciless and it's solid.Karl Urban has got the perfect voice and chin (with that little frown) for this character. That's right, the helmet stays on. He plays the main character in a certain wooden way that absolutely fits. I don't remember much about the comics, but I remember enough that Urban does the character justice. He's a very convincing Dredd and I loved watching him. My respect for him as an actor skyrocketed. He isn't here to promote himself. He isn't here to just ""play"" Dredd. He is Dredd. Well done, Karl. Olivia Thirlby is Anderson, Dredd's sidekick. Don't worry, because she's not a female version of Rob Schneider, a forced love interest or some useless Megan Fox. No, instead Olivia's character is useful, humane, interesting and brings a perfect contrast to Dredd - the balance is wonderful. Thirlby can act, and yes she is beautiful too. She's simply adorable. Thumbs up.Lena Headey makes an excellent villain. She's not your cardboard cutout villain, she's more like a nihilistic drug addict. The fear she strikes into her minions (especially Domhnall Gleeson's wonderfully played character) is not only believable but exciting to watch. Fine job.This movie works so well because there is nothing in it to distract you from what the movie is really about. There is nothing forced. No sentimentality, no token romance, no questioning of morals, no needless twists. On top of that, ""Dredd"" needed to be a really, really violent movie. And that's exactly what it is. It's brutally unforgiving in just the right way. It doesn't quite turn into a gore fest, but the violence is effective and very satisfying. These things alone warrant a great deal of respect. We live in a time where everything is PG13, bland and full of some moral or political propaganda (of which some people wrongly accuse Dredd). For once, we got the real thing.What are the negatives then? I don't know. I can't find any significant flaws. Perhaps the soundtrack could've been more to my personal taste, perhaps the weapons could've sounded ""bigger"", perhaps some of the CGI blood could've been done in the old-fashioned way...see? I can only think of minor gripes. I wouldn't even ask for a more ambitious storyline or a huge parade of special effects because I like how contained, simple and effective ""Dredd"" is. Director Pete Travis and Karl ""the scowl"" Urban, I owe you a beer.Dredd - no bullshit, just balls. Enjoy.",positive,movie

His wife ( played with amazing sexuality buy Jamie Lee Curtis ) loves him unconditionally, but she is a little bored because he is gone half the time and when he is home he tells her about boring computer meetings and how he wowed his clientelle with the latest micro-chips, when in reality he is running through a snow covered field with a tuxedo on while being chased by men on skis carrying Uzis.  But she of course isn't allowed to know about that, something in the name of national security.  Hence we have Simon.  Simon is played for laughs brilliantly by Bill Paxton.  He is the kind of guy that has a normal life but preys on women that may be missing excitement from their life.  This is where he meets Mrs. Tasker.  And he puts the moves on her, seeing the sexiness underneath all of her facades and insecurities.  Paxton and Schwartz. play well off one another and here is no exception as they meet when Arnold goes to his car lot and pretends he wants to buy a car.  Paxton innadvertently tells the man who's wife he is trying to with, that there is this hot little fox that he is almost in with.  Simon laughs like a slob and Harry has a vision of breaking his nose.  It is played for laughs but it is here that Schwartz. gets to show some of this best acting abilities.
The third story is the actual bad guys that want to detonate nuclear warheads in New York for some sort of revenge.  Somehow the three stories mesh perfectly together as Curtis gets mixed up by accident with the terrorists thinking that Simon is being chased by them and so on.  There is so much energy in this film, so much comedy, so much of everything for everyone that I really can't see how anyone could not like this film.True Lies is one of the best action films ever and this is probably Arnie's best acting.  Cameron and Arnie work well together, and Cameron works well with Paxton and hell Arnie and Paxton work well together ( Commando, Terminator and this one).  It would almost be impossible for this film not be great.  And that it certainly is.  You should have no problem popping this one in the DVD or VCR and getting lost in excitement for two hours.",positive,movie
138512,"Throughout his career, director Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Lock Stock and two Smokin' Barrels) has slowly gathered a cult-like following, ensuring that his movies, be they good or bad, will always earn a few dollars from loyal fans. With his 2006 release of Revolver, many of his avid followers found new 'stylistic' directors to drool over, the movie itself receiving mostly negative reviews as a majority of moviegoers claimed it to be 'all style and no substance'. His latest release, RocknRolla, shows Ritchie returning to his roots of gangster oriented, moronic villain centered, hit-man featuring fun. It's a welcome return.RocknRolla is an ensemble piece, centering on many, many characters while remaining surprisingly capable of not focusing on any one member of the never-ending cast. Gerard Butler (300) plays a good-hearted crook for hire by the name of One-Two, a member in a group of 5 blood-to-bones friends, each of which doubles as a partner in crime. The main focus in the gangster-related circle of characters is Lenny Cole, a ruthless, old fashioned thug brought to life by Oscar-nominated Tom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton).The movie truly begins 15 minutes or so after the rather unique opening credits, which in itself foreshadows Ritchie's stylistic thematic which circulates throughout the movie. The eclectically charged plot follows Lenny Cole and his cohorts as they meet and greet Uri, a seemingly reasonable Russian mobster, as the two speak real-estate business. Cole, a self-proclaimed ""King of London"", runs each and every aspect of London, and agrees to allow the Russians their building  for a small sum of 7 million Euros. Agreeing, Uri offers Lenny his favourite painting as a token of appreciation, a hopeful symbol that all will go well.From this point on, viewers are treated to a mishmash of confusing twists, an infinite pallet of characters, and some of the most intelligent writing to hit Hollywood in years. The afore-mentioned painting is stolen from Cole, and a search ensues throughout the entire movie, eventually leading to Johnny Quid (Jamie Campbell), the lead singer of The Quidlickers, and step-son to none other than Lenny himself. Quid, also known as ""The Rocknrolla"", represents a solid contrast to his devilish step-father. Providing monologue after brilliant monologue, Quid becomes a character of classic cool, embodying olden day suave with modern day style, a true to time Rocknrolla.As with every one of Ritchie's gifts to the silver screen, the subtle yet slick script throws the few negative aspects of the movie to the backburner, leaving only pure gold to shimmer and shine. With a never ending stream of British mannerisms combined with over-seas terminology, North American viewers are faced with a rather tricky dilemma: Sit through a movie that may require a small amount of effort to comprehend due to it's foreign tendencies, or instead rely on Dicaprio and Mr. Crowe to deliver yet another bland, meaningless CIA centered action movie in the form of now premiering Body Of Lies. Unfortunately for the masses that truly enjoy a movie with an intelligent script, box office numbers generally speak poorly for Guy Ritchie's films on our side of the pond, his movies usually making no more than a few hundred thousand dollars, only to become cult hits once released on DVD.Viewers may be shocked to see Gerard Butler (best known for his overly masculine performance as King Leonidas in 300) hidden amongst an amazing yet unknown cast, with each actor holding their own and providing more than authentic performances. It is a rare yet beautiful sight to behold, a cast full of actors that have not yet been granted the ""fame"" or spotlight, yet manage to upstage a majority of the actors that we are presented on a day to day basis. It is beyond sad, the least can be said, to see Chris Bridges  A.K.A. Ludicrous (2 Fast 2 Furious)  and Jeremey Pivens (Smokin' Aces) failing miserably in their attempt to act in brief yet important cameo performances, also singled out as the only two American actors in the film, their ""talent"" shadowed and overcast by the nobodies surrounding them.To those readers out there who are contemplating seeing this not-quite-so-common piece of theatre in the form of British Cinema, it is best for you to know there are many worse things you can do. Director Guy Ritchie weaves an intricate quilt the likes of which hasn't been since his debut to theatres, managing to create a truly witty film from nothing more than a missing painting. Definitely a must see.5 out of 5 stars",positive,movie
138651,"This is the kind of film you don't see too often. It is truly a visual masterpiece. I haven't heard about this french director, but ""Mr Nobody"" really blew my mind in all its images, dreams, romance and complexity. The movie has similarities to films by Michel Gondry but i think this film was more magical. Dreamlike and existential films. Some might think Mr Nobody is too complex, too demanding. It is not for everyone, but I loved it. Like other surreal movies, Peter Jacksons ""The Lovely Bones"", and ""Synechdohe: New York"" ""Dr. Parnassus"", ""Micmacs""- these dreamlike and ""difficult"" films must be terribly expensive to produce and I ask myself how can the companies go through with these productions? These flicks never generate big box office money. Im amazed that they still make this kinds of demanding visual movies for cinema. And glad.I discovered the greatness of Jared Leto as an actor when he played John Lennons Killer in Chapter 23. That was a truly disturbing and amazing acting of a disturbed fanatic loner. Mr Nobody is however the role of his life! If you like this kinds of movies I recommend ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"", ""Synechdohe: New York"" and ""THE FOUNTAIN"". They really make you think!",positive,movie
138656,"V. well-made; everyone from the cast and crew pulled their own weight in Body of Lies.Director Ridley Scott's genius shines through what could have been another unpalatable, trite topic of the US' relations with the Middle East and terrorism. He expertly unravels the story of CIA operative Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is assigned to flush out an evasive terrorist who is blowing up public places all over the world. Ferris is increasingly frustrated with his boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe)'s impatience and double dealings, which more than once puts himself in jeopardy, challenges the trust he is trying to build with Jordanian leader Hani (Mark Strong) and his budding romance with the pretty Palestinian nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani).DiCaprio just keeps getting better and better as he is now more able to lose himself in a role and successfully shed the pretty. Crowe does well in an understated but dangerously quiet role as a Washington-based puppetmaster. The versatile Italian-Austrian Andy Garcia-lookalike Strong is fantastic as the powerful Hani, while Farahani's face lights up the screen and turns in a memorable performance as well.The attention to detail in this movie is just awesome; the action sequences are not over the top but satisfactory enough to not lose the main storyline despite the complex thread of subplots. Overall, an engaging, intelligently-made film.",positive,movie
138697,"Five people (later six) wake up inside a giant cube with thousands of rooms inside which are cubes themselves. Some of these rooms are trapped, some are not. These people have no idea how they got there and none of them know each other but they all have a purpose and they must use these purposes to try and escape the giant maze before they die of dehydration.....or madness.This low-budget independent Canadian film is brilliant and a very captivating watch. It's a fairly simple concept but at the same time it is very complex and deep. All the characters are there for a reason and the reasons are fleshed out and believable. The idea of how the cube works is also fleshed out and you can tell the filmmakers really spent a lot of time exploring it. It all seems believable which is important for a movie like this.But the thing I really admire about the film is that the ending doesn't try to explain anything. It leaves everything up to you, you have to figure things out for yourself. The ending leaves a sense of dread and paranoia and is very effective. The traps are also very cool and some of the resulting gore is pretty nasty.4½/5",positive,movie
138780,"I have no doubt this movie will pick up a lot of Oscars in the technical categories, but will miss out on acting. That's not to say it's badly acted, but it is the story itself that is so compelling.The soundtrack and cinematography are just amazing! And the 3D IMAX really add to the spectacle of the whole experience.I think you need a combination of courage and madness to take on Everest as it has been the final resting place of many a climber. You are in awe of the majesty of this mountain. Whether you make it or not isn't just dependent on your experience as a climber, you are at the mercy of the elements that can change dramatically within a few hours.You don't have to have an interest in climbing to appreciate this movie. This drama is based on actual events. The pace and direction are very good. You don't learn a whole lot about many of the characters, but they all have the same goal and ambition. I admire their courage, but I like my adrenalin in a controlled environment at Cedar Point, Ohio!!!!

138832,"John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in an eerie hotel, naked and in the bathtub, with no memories and blood on his forehead. (I couldn't imagine a more strange and frightening experience.) The ring of the hotel phone breaks the silence-- a strange man on the other end tells him he must leave because there are people looking for him. Many events such as this one unfold in Dark City, where ""man has no past... and humanity has no future"".Dark City has been passed over by so many critics it's depressing. I think that it should at least have been up for ""original screenplay"" or SOMETHING at the Oscars to reward Alex Proyas for his fantastic vision. I fail to see why so many people label this movie ""noir"" like it's BAD or something. Being dark and twisted is not a crime, and despite some other people's comments, this movie is NOT just for the trenchcoat-wearing masses (or if it is, maybe the rest of you can learn something from Goths). If you like sci-fi, dark plots and having reality be so well distorted that you don't realize it IS, so you will love Dark City. (People who have seen the Matrix BEFORE this movie MUST see it, it is very similar in these three respects).I gave it a 9 out of 10 ONLY because I thought the ending fight scene was a bit weak. Great for a fight scene, but because the rest of the movie focuses on John Murdoch's quest to discover his past and the eerie, ominous happenings in the city, the climax seemed hastily thrown together, as if the crew all of a sudden remembered they had a deadline to meet and could no longer continue the plot in the previous fashion.The visuals in this movie were absolutely stunning. The effects were NOT used to substitute for the plot, like other movies such as Starship Troopers, Lost in Space and Alien: Resurrection. They were used only as needed and were breathtaking. The editing is NOT as choppy as is rumored, it only lends to the power of the movie. There are some heart-stopping images in Dark City. Watch for the Strangers' clock, views of the city and John's memories.Proyas takes ideas and ambience from many other movies but integrates them all neatly into Dark City. Gotham City is clearly seen as is Metropolis and other influences such as Ed Hopper's ""Nighthawks"" dominate in the diner scenes. The forty-ish era (yet strangely futuristic) city is known to be populated, and yet it is ominously empty (hence one of Hopper's main themes, isolation in large cities). (It's especially quiet at midnight, hehehehe... ;D ) This 40's era ambience together with the sci-fi fantasy undercurrent makes for a very interesting feeling while watching.I'm happy that Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror fame) and William Hurt agreed to do this movie, it gave Dark City just that much more validation in the USA (I wish things weren't like this, but they are). Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful and convincing as the doctor/scientist Dr.Schreber, and Rufus Sewell is a properly confused yet determined John Murdoch. Many critics say that William Hurt's character, the detective, and Jennifer Connelly's Emma Murdoch could have used a little more development, but I think part of the point of Dark City was that you don't really know who people are (not to mention yourself). Richard O'Brien and his character's whole race creep me out every time I see the movie, but he's especially frightening and a strange character. I had to resist the urge to talk like a Stranger after seeing the movie a few times.Trevor Jones, one of my favorite movie composers, did the score for Dark City, and I must say it's very apropo. The deep, bass vocals and frantic themes are some of my favorite aspects, but ""Memories of Shell Beach"" is a haunting, beautiful song as well. Some of my other favorite scores by him are the Dark Crystal and Last of the Mohicans.Altogether, I think Alex Proyas had a stroke of genius in the making of this movie. One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics. I hope these won't be the last of a (dare I say it?) dying race of movies that have true creativity and originality.",positive,movie
138959,"First of all, I must state for the record, Sean Connery is THE James Bond. Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was ""For Your Eyes Only"" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, ""Goldfinger"" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.Before I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.Perhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.But it's more than that. Even watching ""Goldfinger"" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about ""Goldfinger"". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of ""Goldfinger"" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.Much of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially ""Goldfinger"" and ""Dr. No"", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.But if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen ""Goldfinger"" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.",positive,movie

139263,"Pedro Almodovar has created a daring and entirely unique masterpiece, a word that I do not use lightly or often. The Skin I Live In has a lot that of aspects that feel very Almodovar, but there's also a lot of Cronenberg here as well, and with the latter being my favorite director it's no surprise that I fell in love with it quickly. The film is a startling, wild study into a world of obsession, revenge and the complexities of the human flesh. Almodovar has really outdone himself here, crafting a tale of wicked intensity and rarely met eccentricity.The structure here is one of it's more interesting aspects and yet another film this year that isn't told in a strictly linear fashion. We first meet Doctor Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas) in the present day, as he works tirelessly on perfecting a new skin for his subject, the young and beautiful Vera (Elena Anaya). Almodovar establishes us in this present day world, complete with a very Almodovar subplot (a man in a tiger suit comes to the house and brings some trouble) and a lot of baggage for Ledgard. We get to know these people, become intrigued by what brought them to their current state and that we jump back six years to explore this character further.It's a surprising jump and I must admit that it got me off guard at first, but as we spend more and more time in the past building up to the present I slowly came to terms with what Almodovar was doing. He gave us a stake in the present day world so that when he took us into the past it becomes about more than just laying out the facts. We already have a perception on Ledgard and a curiosity into understanding the events that bring him to where we met him, so the film becomes as much of a fascinating game of putting these puzzle pieces together as it is a character study and all-around masterwork of high drama.Slowly the pieces start to come together and I found myself constantly trying to figure out what happened in this world, how these events in the past connect to the present day we were introduced to. When we finally get our answer...stunned...amazed...jaw-unhinged...none of these words can even begin to describe what happened to my mind. This is a twist that doesn't exist for shock value by any means but absolutely sent me to the floor, one of the most shocking and unexpected moves in cinema history as far as I'm concerned. It threw me for a major loop and everything I had come to perceive about these characters and their world was altered in an instant. Everything became a thousand times more fascinating and complex with the use of one simple word.As I said before, this is a piece of the most miraculous and bold high-drama, a world where anything is possible but nothing feels out of place. That is perhaps the most shocking aspect of the film itself, that Almodovar gives us a story filled to the brim with melodrama but none of it feels contrived or too weird or too much. Everything feels totally natural and believable in the world that Almodovar establishes for us. His ability to make this happen is nothing short of extraordinary. Of course he doesn't do it alone and there are a lot of other aspects to the film that contribute to making it work on every conceivable level, to bring us into this incredible world.Of course there are the performances, which are just a dream on their own. I've never been a fan of Antonio Banderas and I've honestly been hesitant to watch films just based on his involvement, but he delivers something here that I never knew he was capable of. Ledgard is an incredibly difficult character to pull off because our perception of him changes drastically throughout the film, but Banderas masters it without a single hitch. There was never a false move, never a moment where I didn't believe this character was capable of doing what he was doing. He is charming, intelligent, deranged and intimidating, unfolding layer after layer as we go on. It's a remarkable achievement in both character and performance. The other performances work very well to support Banderas and Almodovar's work here, particularly from the absolutely gorgeous Elena Anaya. She is all things sympathetic, manic, intriguing and sensual and when we come back to the present day after understanding what brought her to this place, she takes on a whole new life of internal chaos and complexity. For all of her outward expression it becomes a very internal performance and she is sensational here.The technical aspects are all on key, all of them impressing without taking the spotlight away from the story, but the one thing that really left a mark was the phenomenal score. If it wasn't for Hanna, this score would be a runaway victory for my personal win right now. Rarely have I seen music so well-utilized for the atmosphere a director strives to establish. The high-wire drama meets it's ally with this music, a soaring operatic work that brings us into this world so completely. It swept me away and completely engulfed me in this world that Almodovar established. The score is a perfect fit for the film because it captures exactly what the overall product is; a brilliant and original opera of miraculous proportions. This is one of those films that I wasn't expecting a lot from and it just blew me away at every level.",positive,movie

What I liked the most in the film was the positive vibes all the time of viewing which makes an optimistic environment around you. And the character faces trouble also, but in such a way that you will never feel angered on any character.

139622,"This raunchy comedy was a major success at the time of its release (grossing well over $100 million in theaters alone) and still maintains a strong cult following on home video. It is the gross-out boys-only flick that launched a new wave of rude-n'-crude teen comedies, as well as immortalizing John Belushi as one of America's most beloved comedic icons.It's the 1960s and the Delta fraternity is in trouble with the Faber College's Dean Wormer (John Vernon) yet again. The frat's crazy antics have gotten out of hand and the grades of its students have been steadily declining. Grabbing at the opportunity, Dean Wormer uses their poor grades and behavior as an excuse to kick them off the campus. However, the Deltas fight back  and give it all they've got.""Animal House"" is solely responsible for the surge of teen-styled comedies in the 1980s and '90s. There is no other film predating this, to speak of, which mixed sex, profanity, vulgarity, slapstick and rebellion all into one funny little bundle. ""Animal House"" truly is a revolutionary comedy, for better or worse. Yet in fact for all its offensive material, ""Animal House"" is joyously likable, infectious and agreeable. The writers  Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller  create a plethora of strong characters, which helps define and separate ""Animal House"" from many of its imitators (and indeed compares it to the equally-enjoyable ""American Pie"" series, which  like the ""Animal"" before it  took the time to study and care for its characters, rather than completely exploit them for ""humor""  it's always harder to laugh at characters we don't care about, and much easier to laugh at those of whom we do).Director John Landis (who would re-team with Belushi again in 1980 with ""The Blues Brothers"") not only understands his cast (mainly Belushi) but also his audience and paves a way for sibling genre entries through his realistic slapstick approach (this is not crazy in the same way as Airplane, Naked Gun or Police Academy is  in fact it's far more rooted in realism and only a few sequences really get out of hand and turn into classic dumb slapstick).John Belushi as the alcoholic Bluto Blutarsky (on getting kicked out of college: ""Seven years down the drain! I might as well join the Peace Corps!"") remains the scene-stealer to this day, yet despite the film's close links with Belushi in general he is just a co-star, and when on-screen rarely speaks (a fact played to the film's comedic advantage  when Bluto gives his final rousing speech, it seems to mean something, even ifwellit doesn't.) Belushi demanded the largest paycheck of all the actors  including Donald Sutherland  but is hardly the ""star"" of ""Animal House."" Had he been, it may very well not have been as successful as it turned out to be  not because Bluto is annoying, but because introducing him in smaller portions  rather than focusing on him alone  constructs a fall-back mechanism of sorts; when the comedy is lagging too much, they bring in Bluto for support.Bluto thrives on fun and partying  when he learns of a possible toga party, he begins a chant. One imagines he's so drunk and stoned he doesn't really understand much of what is going on. The film never identifies with him on a personal level. He's just sort of there. And we get the feeling perhaps he's only involved in the frat's antics because it's a blast  does he really care about staying in college? Or does he just want more free booze? ""Animal House"" might not be the best comedy of all time, and I'm hardly going to start arguing that it is. For one thing, it can tend to be a bit inconsistent  the humor is never continuously strong; rather it comes in bursts. Technically, it's imperfect  by a long shot. However, whoever said that the amount of laughter alone defines the greatness of a comedy? Do we need it to be fine art? ""Animal House"" doesn't only have its fair share of funny material and iconic screen moments, but is also incredibly entertaining, rowdy and cool  the quintessential college film and certainly the sort of comedy any self-respecting bachelor would make sure he views at least two hundred times a year. (Give or take.) All together, now: ""Toga, toga, toga!""",positive,movie
139631,"As I've posted previously I don't really like musicals, never have, generally waayyy too cheesy for my tastes. But in the absence of something else that drew our attention we went to see Once. We were in the Cinema anyway so why not. We went mostly, I suppose, as we'd seen Glen Hansard and the Frames playing before and they were great so we thought the movie couldn't be too bad. At the end of the day we both really liked this movie, not too sentimental and the music which is written and performed by the two main characters is excellent. It irks me to see other Irish people in here with such negative views, it really seems like its something personal towards Glen Hansard. I don't know the guy whatsoever but this is about the film which is worth seeing.I'd seen Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova live in Christchurch cathedral in Dublin which in itself was pretty different. I'd only been inside the cathedral once before pretty much as a tourist.

139640,"Six-time Academy Award nominated director Peter Weir (""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", ""The Truman Show"") directed and wrote the adaptive screenplay for ""The Way Back"" based on the book ""The Long Walk: A True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" by Slawomir Rawicz, a Polish POW from the Soviet Gulag where the story begins, and on real life accounts of the journey. The film unluckily missed a very well deserved 2010 Oscar birth telling the tale about an unthinkable journey of kinship created between a diverse group of Soviet Gulag escapees. Their journey covers 4,000 miles from Siberia to freedom in India giving meaning to the word incredible. The cinematography is used most majestically by capturing panoramas of the strikingly dangerous yet breathtakingly beautiful landscapes. The splendor of the film goes beyond the wilderness with the selection of a very accurate and diverse cast starring Jim Sturgess (""21""), Ed Harris (""The Rock""), Colin Farrel (""In Bruges""), Saoirse Ronan (""The Lovely Bones""), and Mark Strong (""Sherlock Holmes""). Together they recreate the peril and wonder of the impossible journey on foot that started with the idea of a man named Khabrov (Strong) to break out of the Godforsaken Soviet Gulag in Siberia. A Polish man named Janusz, driven by the fire to get back to his wife, puts the idea into action. An older, wise American known as Mr. Smith (Harris) joins ranks when he hears about Janusz's plans and warns him that Khabarov never had any aspiration to actually leave the place. However, the idea becomes a reality attracting an indebt prisoner named Valka (Farrel) and four other men escaping the Gulag and meeting a young girl named Irena (Ronan) on the path to freedom.The story is synonymous with walking more than a marathon every day through harsh terrain, uncontrollable elements and lack of food and water for an open-ended amount of time. The gravity of the story is unmatched by any film released this year; told through the art of cinematography and the acting talents of the cast. Both Oscar worthy aspects of the film, however, the cinematography itself is unmatched by any 2010 film. Also, a lot can be said about the all-star cast concerning Jim Sturges, Ed Harris, Colin Farrel, Mark Strong, and Saoirse Ronan and their superb character portrayals; however, there is one other actor that stands out. A man in the group named Zoran played by Dragos Bucar is able to break through the thin layer of dramatic tension in the film with his clever social humor. The comedy he creates does not take away from the story and instead adds to the story allowing the characters to unwind and have a good time. The outcomes to films within the ""jailbreak"" genre are inevitably easy to predict, therefore, causing films like ""The Way Back"" to work hard in order to be original. ""The Way Back"" does a very good job by differentiating the way it is captured on film through its beautiful cinematography; however, great films such as ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Great Escape"" will always be on top of the genre. ""The Way Back"" isn't far off though with its main shortcoming stemming from the ending relying on a storyline tangent not fully developed (not the montage, the montage is great).This is the most underrated movie of 2010 with its limited advertising exposure, release and lack of award fulfillment with only one Oscar nomination for Best Make Up (well deserved as the group of survivors' skin is torn apart by the elements). A 4,000-mile true story taking place in the World War II era with excellent cinematography and great acting seems like the ideal candidate for the Oscars.

Later on, when it arrived on video, the clerks at the local store rolled their eyes and told stories of renters returning it and complaining that it wasn't funny and was boring. So I didn't rent it, being the mindless lemming that would listen to a video store clerk.Then I stumbled across it on one of the TV movie channels and sat down and watched it. Perhaps it was the lack of any expectations on my part, but I found this movie fascinating. Bill Murray has cornered the market on middle aged male guilt and regret. Between this film, Lost in Translation and the Life Aquatic he presents us with a very real sense of what it means to be in your mid fifties and contemplating all that has been missed while pursuing something else.The movie moves slowly, at a measured pace, but it has to, because that is how the story unfolds, with the protagonist moving down the road of his past reluctantly, and with trepidation and rightly so, because he has left skeletons behind. Many of them, it would appear.Bill Murray was always my favorite SNL guy and he never disappoints, always taking whatever role he is given and doing it well, and doing it as only Bill Murray can. David Spade and Chevy Chase, eat your hearts out. Actually, just retire. But I digress.The supporting cast deserves kudos as well. For once, I liked Sharon Stone in a movie. Francis Conroy does her Six Feet Under persona but manages to spin it a little differently, and Jessice Lange is mesmerizing as always. And Jeffrey Wright, as Winston is a perfect foil for the perpetually deadpan Murray.But in fairness, I suspect that you have to be middle aged and male to really love this movie and all of its wisdom.",positive,movie
139846,"Ingenious and mesmerizing little art film from producer-writer-director Francis Ford Coppola, just off ""The Godfather Part II"" and doing astounding, fluid work. Gene Hackman gives a superbly controlled performance as a wire-tapper who gets too involved in one of his cases, leaving him in the center of a macabre swirl of events. One of those quiet movies that fans of today's blockbusters probably won't appreciate; it tells us quite a lot about the main character without actually saying much at all, so assured are the visuals. It ends on a chilling note that leaves the protagonist alienated from his life, but Coppola is careful never to alienate his audience. Coppola received Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Screenplay; Hackman deserved a nod as Best Actor but was shamefully overlooked. Their film is a winner. ***1/2 from ****",positive,movie
139890,"The film starts with the message that it is based on true events. Although you might wonder what was changed for the film, you soon forget that and accept it as a whole. In short it was brilliant. It could have been a predictable story but instead it had other dimensions and took unexpected directions with strong characters and some humour. I thought I knew an outline beforehand and was pleasantly surprised when that part was covered in the first twenty minutes. It was intriguing where the story would take us and that happened a few more times later. In addition to Philomena's journey, there was also Martin Sixsmith's journey from the beginning as just a detached journalist doing a human interest story on someone, whom he thought was beneath him, to being totally involved and offering not to publish it. To illustrate the depths of this film you can see how it attacks cruel, narrow-minded, sanctimonious Catholicism and at the same time shows how the faith gave strength to Philomena and the ability to forgive rather than to wreak vengeance. The acting was totally convincing. It is going to be a competitive year but Judy must be up for another Oscar. Just watching Steve Coogan's almost imperceptible expressions of irritation as Philomena told him the interminable plot of the book she had just been reading, was wonderful. This is definitely the best film I have seen all year. After writing this I read the interview with Martin Sixsmith on the Guardian web-site. It fills in more detail about Michael Hess (Anthony Lee) but confirms the whole truth of the story.",positive,movie
139946,"Steven Spielberg makes a unique motion picture in regards to the D-Day invasion of World War II just in the gritty reality of the detail For more than twenty minutes he revives for us the landing at Omaha beach No one was prepared for how horrific it really was No one understood what was going on: The terror, the chaos, the maelstrom of bullets, the near-deafening explosionsYou really got a sense of what these guys had to go through Within that perplexity, the focus settles on six soldiers under the command of Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) after they've survived their terrible hours breaking through the first line of German defense, they're given a strange perilous mission, to find one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines For them, it's an abstruse order, but they have to get it doneThroughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer It's one of the most intimate It's also a slightly confusing moment because two German characters resemble each other so greatlyToward the middle, a German soldier called ""Steamboat Willie"" is introduced By the end of the film, he has become the 'bad' German Later in the movie, another German is involved in the final fight He takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of hand-to-hand combat with the American soldier The two German soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms Because they looked so much alike, many of us have believed that they're one character They're not, and the distinction of the two is very significant",positive,movie

140072,"I would consider myself a Wes Anderson fan, however in saying that, I have only seen a handful of his movies. I was very excited for The Grand Budapest Hotel, because of its excellent cast, the fact it's directed by Wes Anderson and just by how unique it looked. After watching The Grand Budapest Hotel, I can confidently say that it's my new favourite Wes Anderson film, and probably his best.As I was hoping, the story to The Grand Budapest Hotel is very original and unique, some may even say strange. And as the movie goes on, the story only gets wilder and wilder. The film is often very hilarious, with some seriously funny dark humour thrown in there as well. Characters are extremely well written, with the bond between Gustave and Zero being the backbone of the whole movie as it's so well written. The Grand Budapest Hotel features an odd narrative structure that works very well for the film, again adding to the uniqueness and freshness of it. I wasn't exactly sure how the story would play out, as I purposely avoided all promotional materiel so I would know as little as possible before watching. This was a great benefit to my viewing experience as I loved everything I saw, and felt as though nothing was spoiled from watching too many trailers.I haven't been a huge fan of most of Ralph Fiennes' work since his phenomenal performance in 1993′s ""Schindler's List"", but this is easily his best performance since then. He proves he can do comedy just as well as he can do drama, providing a perfect balance of both. Newcomer Tony Revolori is excellent as well. I won't get into the whole supporting cast because there's so many who were all so great, but I was particularly impressed by Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law and Saoirse Ronan.The Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely a Wes Anderson film, down to its very core. If you know his style, then you known what to expect, as this movie is full of it. Thankfully though, it's not a case of style over substance, with a great story to accompany the gorgeous visuals. The colour palette is beautiful; it's nice to see lot's of bright colours when so many other films are so dark and dreary. The set design and costumes are perfect, and there's so much attention to detail within the sets. The cinematography is phenomenal, and I really like how the film was presented in different aspect ratios.You really can't go wrong with this film. It's probably Wes Anderson's best film, it has gorgeous visuals, excellent acting and a wonderful story. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's previous work, you cannot miss this, and even if you're not a fan you should go and see it anyway.",positive,movie
140255,"Here in the small town where I reside, our local newspaper had a recent headline that a beloved teacher was suspected of improper contact with a student. The article was complete along with his picture and I felt that this teacher's life was over as he knew it whether the information was accurate or false. I felt that I would withhold judgement pending an accurate and a detailed investigation, but I know that others would not give the teacher this courtesy. Human nature is an interesting thing to observe and we often get trapped in our own snares with comments such as ""I really can't tolerate judgemental people"".Recently I saw another Danish movie ""The Hijacking"" and was so impressed with it, that I sought out this movie as it was also a highly regarded project. I'm glad I did. The movie reflected the idea of a rush to judgement and all the implications of how society reacts when information is inaccurately reinforced.The title of the movie, ""The Hunt"" is symbolic of Lucas's hunt for justice, but also feeling like the hunted. It begins with friends at a hunting camp drinking & celebrating but this hunt is all a metaphor for Lucas's life. Perhaps it was best expressed when his son got a family heirloom hunting rifle and it was said that now he was old enough to find his way in the forest. ""The Hunt"" is really about such a journey and the forest was thick with assumptions, accusations, hatred, betrayal, and a host of other thorns, briars, branches and such things to trip up the journey. Having felt like he was being hunted through a community's narrow rifle scope of understanding, Lucas's idea of hunting is ultimately altered....and believably so.Vinterberg does a masterful job of story telling and in such a way that we hear a morality tale. Yes, many times the information we are told in the news is correct. But what if it isn't? What price is paid by the victim and his/her family? If you want to watch a movie that is different from the typical Hollywood variety and gives you reason to search more deeply before believing what you see and hear, watch ""The Hunt"" and see if you would find your way through the same forest that Lucas traveled. Few of us would be able to do so....",positive,movie
140358,"I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplin's nicest, most under-appreciated silent movie gems. Then I discovered it really wasn't underrated; it's rated very high on most critics' lists. It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this one.Part of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that I'm a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. It's a romance between Charlie's tramp character (no name) and a blind girl, who also had no name in this film. Virginia Cherill, who played the blind woman and had a wholesome, pretty face which I found very attractive.I'm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton, but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as ""talkies"" were out in full force by 1931. Chaplin was at his best in silent movies, anyway, and his comedy routines are legendary. He gave me a lot of laughs in this film, as always, and I particularly laughed (I love slapstick) at the boxing scene. Kudos, too, to Harry Myers as the ""eccentric millionaire.""There's a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86-minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl, raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight.Comedy, romance, drama (with suffering) all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment. It's hard to believe this movie was not up for one, single Academy Award.",positive,movie
140493,"""Luther"" the new BBC detective series lead by Idris Elba as DCI John Luther, is a riveting watch. This character, Luther, is a loose cannon primed to fire at will or by wonder, yet this detective's intelligence and focus seems to keep him charging in the right direction. He and fellow officers appear to work on a rather intuitive level and their ability to relate to us 'common folk' and our reaction to injustice, is a magnetizing factor. The relationship he has with his wife, Zoe, works well as a part of the machinery that helps reveal the different layers of his character. Beyond that, I must admit I feel slightly ambiguous towards her part, at this point, anyway.But I am fascinated with Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson of ""Jane Eyre"" 2006). I had a very good friend with similar characteristics as she; the writers, as well as the actress, portrayed Alice as if they knew my friend intimately. Of course, it is difficult to know the 'deviosity' of which such people are capable, especially when your affections are securely attached through years of shared experiences. As I watch Alice Morgan attempt to secure even the friendship of Luther, I think, ""Oh, go ahead, trust her."" And then, I remind myself that this character killed her parents! This goes to the depraved depth of the sociopath's personality and how they can manipulate us. Chilling! Great stuff For anyone who holds an interest towards the Behavioral Sciences, and desires to watch something that will entertain, as well as appeal to that part of your brain, give ""Luther"" a shot, you won't be sorry.",positive,movie
140639,"This is definitely worth watching. The direction is restrained, SRK has acted really well after a long time, and there is a naive yet charming idealism underpinning the movie. It could have been a tad shorter, crisper editing would have helped. BO-wise it is a risky movie - unapologetic in its depiction of poverty and almost childlike in its appeal to NRIs and India's middle class to acknowledge poverty and try to do something about it. Gowarikar's heart is in the right place - the shots with the family unable to pay land rents, and the waterboy were graceful and poignant. My hunch is that regardless of BO fate, this is an important movie and will be referred to for year to come.",positive,movie

I would argue this is Fellini's best film. Everything works.  It is so full of little things, from the farm folk hired as extras to the rubber boots worn by Quinn striding into the ring to do his corny strongman act.  Fellini nearly drove Masina crazy during the filming-- he wouldn't let her bath or wash her hair for weeks on end-- but, the end result speaks for itself.

Deigo decides to return to his hometown Yamagata with his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) to live in the house that his mother, who has just passed away, left for him. While seeking a job in the newspaper, he finds an advertisement entitled Departures in the NK Agency and he schedules an interview believing it is a travel agency. However, he finds out that the position is to work in a funeral business as a sort of undertaker that prepares the corpse for cremation and the afterlife. While Mika and his friends look down on his job, Daigo feels proud with the recognition of the families of the diseased persons with his work. When the owner of the bathhouse Tsurunoyu dies, Mika finally recognizes the beauty of the artistic work of Daigo. When they are informed that his absent father has died alone in a fishing village, Daigo resolves his innermost issues with him.The winner of Best Foreign Language Film of 2009 ""Okuribito"" is a touching movie with a beautiful and full of sentiments story about life and death. The idea of death as a gateway to the afterlife has been explored in many movies; but in ""Okuribito"" it is disclosed in an artistic and beautifully sad way, through a dramatic and respectful but never corny relationship with the families of the diseased person. This wonderful movie was awarded with thirty-one (31) wins and three (3) nominations to several film festivals, and is supported by an original screenplay based on the rich Japanese culture that brings the most different and antagonistic feelings to the viewer; magnificent direction and performances of the lead and support cast; fantastic cinematography, lighting and art direction; and a stunning and stylish music score.

At 60 years plus, I probably have. But, the first two episodes of Almost Human had me watching. I especially like the narration that was prevalent in the second episode. Instead of contrived (and boring) sequences (like a one sided phone conversation) to explain where they characters are going now, someone tells you. Genius! Love it! And a great job of narrating.Acting is very good, effects are more than adequate. A bit of a ""Blade Runner"" feel to the show. A touch of humor in (so far) the right places to lighten things up.

This builds up epic battles which will be taking place in the next few episodes and the tension here is spectacular. Without any spoilers, this episode starts of brilliantly, with an arrival of someone that made me smile from ear to ear. The Jon and Sansa's storyline was also very good here, as it will pay off when the big battle arrives. The scenes at Kings Lander were not all that important, with some good lines thrown in there, but little happening, but still enough to hold your interest.The Arya scenes were very well done, but very rushed. All of the episodes this season have been way too short, and there feels like they could have had time for some more scenes. However the best part about this episode is its build up, every character we see if thrown in a cliffhanger of sorts. Also the production this episode was outstanding, the sets the beautiful landscapes and new regions we have never seen before, were done so well. This is a slow episode but it is by far not boring, it was like the older episodes that built up tension that will pay off soon. 9/10",positive,movie
141791,"Come celebrate the end of prohibition with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high society and wise-cracking Nick and Nora Charles.  Not only do they put away a large quantity of alcohol, but they solve a bizarre and fascinating murder case in the process despite Nick's best efforts not to get involved.  He finally succumbs by taking the case to not only outside pressure, but instinctive curiosity and boredom that goes with being part of the idle class.  Not only is he a super sleuth turned gentleman, but he is quite the aficionado on mixing drinks.  We are first introduced to Nick as he instructs bartenders on the proper technique on mixing drinks (""In mixing the important thing is the rhythm.  You should always have rhythm in your shaking.  A manhattan you shake to a foxtrot, a dry martini you shake to a waltz"", etc.)  Also added into the fray, is their terrier, Asta, who helps Nick solve the mystery. Despite being made nearly 70 years ago, Powell and Loy's performances and chemistry together remain as strong today as they were then.  This detective has clearly married into a family with a significant fortune, but Nick and Nora's love for each other is genuine and often reflected in sarcastic teasing of each other.  When Nora walks in on him consoling a beautiful young woman by embracing her, he just wrinkles his nose at her and she returns the gesture which indicates the level of trust that exists among this couple.  While Nick is often observant of an attractive woman, Nora doesn't keep him on a tight leash because their instinctive trust with one another.  The film is packed with humor centering around the Charles' vices, mainly drinking and the subsequent hangovers and the complacency of not being required to work for a living.  How many detectives are such smooth talkers that they befriend the criminals they helped convict once they've served their time and party with them on Christmas Eve?  So if you enjoy a bit of sarcastic humor in your murder mysteries, chances are you'll love this film. A few side notes:  Watch for Cesar Romero in this film.  He later played The Joker in the Batman series in the 1960's.  In later Thin Man movies, you can see a young Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Dean Stockwell, and Penny Singleton. Also, I noticed that it was Christmas Eve in this movie 2 days in a row. First, in the bar where we first see Nick, Maureen O'Sullivan says to her boyfriend that it's Christmas Eve and the next morning when Nora wakes up with a hangover they say it's Christmas Eve then.  My only other criticism was the scene where Nick diverts the attention of a man holding him at gunpoint in the bedroom by tossing a pillow at him.  I wish they had come up with something a little more believable.  Other than those 2 minor points, an outstanding movie.  I don't think Hollywood could make something as original and entertaining today if their lives depended on it.  On a scale of 10 martinis, 9/10.",positive,movie

Things change however. The most interesting story takes us back to Theon and Ramsey, the utter psychotic ""possible"" son. He is totally evil, embracing the fear of everyone. He is also a coward because he has only accomplished things through his being shielded by his power base. He abuses women and plays psychological games with Sansa. He knows that she is vulnerable.

Now, this has come.Ayushmann is an IPS officer. He has been posted in a small village in UP. However, the next day itself, the police get two bodies of minor girls hanging on the tree. They were raped multiple times. The story gets its pace. And this crime drama continues with the subtext of casteism.Anubhav Sinha has tried to cover as many incidents of Dalits and other backward class people as possible which happened in our country in last few years. The motto is just to aware people on how this things work. From whatsapp messages to arrangement of strikes and rallys, this is how we are dividing us into groups. Also, this is 2019, not just 19! Justice should prevail for everyone without considering his/her caste. And there comes the title, Article 15, which gives each Indian basic rights.Ayushmann has given a splendid performances. He is too good for this role. Isha Talwar gives a needful support to him. Sayami Gupta shines in her effective role. Best of her was crying with Kumud Mishra in this film. Kumud Mishra is terrific. He has played this role like no one can. His slap scene is clap worthy. Manoj Pahwa again delivers wonderful performance. Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub has a special appearance. The time he comes in the story, the film picks up very high. Fantabulous performance by him.Movie has no songs in it. Just a satire song at the starting. And a rap song at the end credits.Dialogues are absolutely fantastic. 'Power ki alag hi jaat hoti hai!' Hard hitting one liners will blow your mind. Entire speech by Zeeshan Ayyub in the jeep is perfectly written. Audience were clapping on the last line of that dialogue by him. While my most favorite one has been spoken by Ayushmann to his officer, that 'Jab Aag Lagi Hui Ho Aur Aap Neutral Rahen, To Iska Matlab Hai Ki Aap Unn Logon Ke Side Hain Jo Aag Laga Rahe Hain!'This is going to be a hit in Anubhav Sinha's kitty. While in first half, I was not sure whether this one is more good or that Mulk! But I got clear answer in second half. Film picks up very high. There is a greatest twist too. Public were stunned in that scene. Film is superbly written by Sinha and Gaurav Solanki.There is scene of bodies of rape victims hanging on the tree, and a kid passes by. It gave me goosebumps. Another one is a man coming out of the gutter. One at the interval point, nd one at the last line of a long dialogue by Mohd Zeeshan. Also, it is not a serious film. This year's the most comic scene is in this one. Ayushmann discussing castes with his team.Overall, Article 15 a is very much needful film in this time. It may not be linked with metro cities, but India is a nation of villages and small towns. Kudos to Anubhav Sinha and team for choosing this subject. Police were there in the theater for safety purpose. But there is nothing wrong in the film for any community or caste. This film will run with mouth publicity. So go and watch this entertaining crime drama. And ask yourself a question that Kaun Hain Aap! Bahujan, Harijan.. Ke Jan Gan Man me aate sirf Jan.

143536,"Have you ever had one of those moments where you realize that reality is all a blur and what you thought was right isn't even close to it? Well that's how I felt when I sat down and watched the Windsor Drive Premier at Laemmle NoHo 7 Theater in North Hollywood. The debut film by Natalie Bible' co-owner of Absinthe Productions starring Samaire Armstrong, Anna Biani, Kyan DuBois and Tommy O'Reilly, is nothing short of brilliant and though it may confuse and even upset you at times, it's one that had me question what I watched days after viewing. Windsor Drive right out of the gates makes you feel relaxed and ready for everything it has to offer. Then out of the blue it kicks you in the junk and doesn't say sorry. No apologies needed, as I realized how much I wanted a film like this in my life. With the over saturated market flooded with bland characters, overused plots and typical looking camera angles it's hard to find a diamond in the rough. Windsor Drive is more then just a diamond though; it's an adventure, an experience that transforms your senses with every scene. It made me uncomfortable and rethinks my thought process and to be honest I was a little upset.Why?Natalie Bible' did not give me what I expected. She didn't give me a story that was mundane yet familiar. She didn't feed me a bunch of plot holes disrespecting me the viewer to the point of exhaustion. She didn't give me garbage wrapped up in pretty marketing design. Instead Bible's translation of the script was beautifully shot, well edited and an emotional roller-coaster that had me wanting to get in line again and again and again. Though at times Windsor Drive did feel like a long music video because every scene had music and that's usually something I dislike. Yet, realizing how strategic every little detail of Windsor Drive was to Bible' you realize that the music elevated the chaos of Tommy O'Reilly's character River Miller. Tommy O'Reilly's gripping character River Miller is chilling and unnerving at times. O'Reilly's good looks mixed with a voice any woman would die for, any man for that matter, not only elevates the wannabe movie star character but helps keep you dialed into his story. River Miller is one messed up dude and to be honest it's someone all of us at one point of our lives can relate too. We all struggle with identity and wanting to fit in and that's why we become invested with O'Reilly's character. You want to understand his struggle, his pain, and his thoughts while maintaining a safe distance. However, O'Reilly is not the star of Windsor Drive. Windsor Drive is the star. This film can stand-alone and will not and cannot be put into a box. I suppose if there was a genre to file Windsor Drive under it would be Documentary before Thriller/Suspense. Natalie Bible' and crew set out to create the best damn film they could and they did. It's the most honest interpretation of the drive and obsession of making it into a cutthroat business of Hollywood. Thank you for forcing us to take a deep look into what we all continue to strive for; be the popular kid on the block. Beards And Fears Podcast",positive,movie

All this talk of global warming is not hitting home for me, but the supercollider causing a black hole is very unsettling (END PREACH). As usual, the acting was overwrought but, given the ending, the hysteria fit. The characters were not over-simplified and the effects were effective.

143915,"Earlier there was ""Ssssss!"", where a man is transformed into a snake by a sinister scientist. In ""Jaws of Satan"" it's a priest battling the Devil in a form of a serpent. It all start where two men were trying to run a dog race track in a Southern town when the box contained a snake breaks loose and killed the two men on the train. I know one got out of the train when the snake struck. But how did the engineer get killed by the snake?
Well when the snake gets loose, and other snake strikes gets the townsfolk into a frenzy of terror. The town's priest who was living in such denial in his life needed to build up his faith after hearing a lie about his descendant's cause of death. It took 3 people: the medical examiner, a Herpentologist,and the priest to stop the Evil snake and save the town from certain doom.

I just recommend everyone - WATCH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT - these are 2 completely different movies! As a huge fan of Trejo I can't believe what these incompetent guys at Giant Ape did with this movie! The Director's Cut (International version) is really a great cinematic action-thriller, but the Giant Ape / US version is a slow-paced drama which reminds of a typical boring TV crime movie. The slow-paced US cut misses a lot of necessary scenes which are very important for the story, for the characters and for the pace of the movie. Instead it seems like they just put together the worst & most boring scenes with an absolutely boring score (Chris Ridenhour's score in the Director's cut is much, much more better!). The Giant Ape cut should be seized immediately!This should be shown on all film schools worldwide as a classic example how editing & scoring can change & ruin a movie.Everyone who watches both versions will understand my anger. If you want to see a good movie just watch the Director's Cut (International version)! 9 of 10 stars for the Director's Cut. 1 of 10 stars for the US version.",positive,movie

But Ben 10 week started on CartoonNetwork and I couldn't help but get hooked when the cartoon came on. Because of this, I decided to give the movie a try as it was going to be on this week. I watched it last night and I'm really happy that I gave it a chance. It reminds me of the shows I used to watch when I was little and it made me feel like when I used to pretend I was on adventures with my friends. And if a movie can do that to me, it is most certainly worth watching. It brings you back to a time when you wished you could play the hero and wanted more than anything to have those sorts of adventures. But if you watch it, remember that it is a kid's movie, so don't expect a great adventure movie from it, just expect that it will keep you entertained and that it allows you to remember way back when.",positive,movie

144723,"I went to see based on a recommendation from my writer's group, dragging my husband along with me to a theater over an hour away. We had seen the trailer, but didn't realize that it would be laugh-out-loud funny so often. The semi-documentary style of the movie made it feel like you got to know each of the characters really well. The movie took you through all of the emotions that you experience as a writer; the heartache of rejection, the envy of others' success, and the fear that you might never get a contract yourself. This movie is not 'easy' watching. As with many indie movies, there are times between laughs that are really uncomfortable, and you just have to sit with them and let them sink in. I was impressed by how each of the actors were able to show their characters struggle with the awkwardness of their own emotions in various situations.Both my husband and I were impressed with the movie. We both think that it felt 'real'.

145332,"Leigh Ann Watson (Katie Holmes) has only days left before she finishes high school. She's a good student who wants to go to college, but she's having trouble getting approved for financial aid, which she desperately needs. If she can only finish her senior year as class valedictorian, she knows she can get a scholarship. Enter the source of conflict of the film, Mrs. Eve Tingle (Helen Mirren), history teacher. Mrs. Tingle doesn't seem to like Leigh Ann. In fact she doesn't seem to like anyone except Trudie Tucker (Liz Stauber), a trust fund kid on her way to Harvard regardless of her senior class standing. Leigh Ann needs Mrs. Tingle to give her an A+ to become valedictorian while giving Trudie a lesser grade. How far will Leigh Ann and her friends go to convince Mrs. Tingle? The premise of the film may sound a bit silly and unrealistic, and it is. But the focus of the film isn't the premise. This is not a plot-driven film in any traditional sense. It's an exploration of particular kinds of character dynamics for which the plot is merely an excuse to get to the necessary situations. As for realism, I don't require that in my films for any particular facts. On the other hand, Teaching Mrs. Tingle is incredibly realistic in terms of many of those character dynamics. So I don't subtract points just because something is realistic either. Realism is a consideration that writers and directors of fiction films are free to play with as they choose.Although marketed as a thriller, and it certainly has those aspects as well as other subtexts, Teaching Mrs. Tingle is much more a film about acting. If you analyze what acting is, you realize that it involves putting on some kind of ""false front"", some kind of role-playing where the role isn't identical to your personal self-image and modes of behavior, and where you're feigning with the intent of selling others on the performance. In Teaching Mrs. Tingle, acting is explored in all its guises, from literal theatrical senses to public false fronts to attempts at deception for ulterior motives. So the film is really a study of how all people are actors with respect to each other in various ways, with very occasional moments of authenticity in personal dynamics inserted as contrast to underscore the idea. Writer/director Kevin Williamson weaves this exploration of acting at least through every non-technical element of the film--relationships, scenarios, dialogue and plot.Leigh Ann's friend Jo Lynn Jordan (Marisa Coughlan) literally wants to be an actor, so we see her performing as Marilyn Monroe early in the film and later doing a scene from The Exorcist (1973). She also has a chance to act as Mrs. Tingle and later, during a pivotal moment in the climax, as a character she's created on her own.Leigh Ann's history project is an instance of an object having a ""false front"" (as if the object itself is acting), and we see Leigh Ann putting on false public faces, mostly to appease those she loves (Jo Lynn and her mom, Faye (Lesley Ann Warren)). In one case, she is also acting to push away someone she loves (Luke Churner (Barry Watson)), and later to deceive someone she loves (Jo Lynn again) and does not want to hurt.Luke's instances of acting are similar to Leigh Ann's.Coach Wenchell (Jeffrey Tambor) is acting to deceive his wife, and we also see him go through some fairly literal role-playing. Later, he's also the ""victim"" of deceptive acting and another case of ""object acting"", directed by others.Principal Potter (Michael McKean) and Miss Banks (Molly Ringwald) are classic examples of publicly putting on false fronts for more ""political"" reasons.And of course there's Mrs. Tingle. Mrs. Tingle is both the target and source of much of the acting in the film. She's frequently the victim of various levels of deceptions. Characters are constantly acting to show her that they're something they're not in an effort to crack through her armor. Her armor is an act. She gives many deceptive performances herself. And she also literally references acting many times throughout the film in her dialogue, seeming especially fond of Shakespeare.There are many more examples, but that gives you an idea of the focus and complexity of the film on a character level. As I mentioned earlier, occasionally the acting is contrasted with bouts of authenticity, the two most important ones being the later relationship between Leigh Ann and Luke, and Mrs. Tingle's monologue, during which she cleverly mixes authenticity and acting. Given the theme and the fact that we're watching a film, Teaching Mrs. Tingle is something of a postmodernist tour de force. The performers must show various levels of their characters acting while as they're also acting as actors in the film. The two required to play the most levels--Mirren and Coughlan--are the most overtly impressive, but everyone is excellent.From this review, it should be clear that Teaching Mrs. Tingle is more of a straight drama that's not just a ""silly teen flick"". In overall structure, the film is a ""black comedy"" (but where ""comedy"" is more the traditional dramatic sense of the term). It is also sometimes comic in the modern popular sense (where you expect to laugh out loud)--Ringwald as Miss Banks actually steals this film on this level at one point--and as mentioned earlier, there are also ""thriller"" aspects, so that the film is sometimes suspenseful, although not usually in traditional or clichéd ways. A nice pop soundtrack also accompanies the film, if you enjoy that.",positive,movie

The device in which each segment flows into the next was unique and added a new layer to the experience. I am a huge fan of horror anthologies in general (VHS, ABC's of Death, Late Night Double Feature, etc.) but occasionally they seem like a collection of shorts thrown together.

145963,"Shamefully neglected horror thriller is probably the best slasher film to follow in the footsteps of Scream (1996), too bad it ended up being a television movie!In the seemingly innocent town of Cherry Falls, Virginia, someone is murdering high school students who just happen to be virgins!Clever premise, being a twist on the classic slasher convention of sex=death, pays off in this dark and splendidly suspenseful shocker. The direction of Wright is solid with the occasional touch of stylishness. He makes good use of the Virginia filming locations and adds some spooky elements, like the rather creepy looking killer. Ken Seldon takes what could have been a lousy concept and makes a wonderfully twisted and entertaining story. There's also the occasional touch of comic relief (like the have sex or die party) and a dark sense of humor about the story. The murder sequences are gory and shocking despite the limitations of TV censors, which caused some of the film to be edited.The cast is pretty good. Young Brittany Murphy is appealing and likable as a rather unconventional leading girl. Michael Biehn is great as Murphy's father who's also the local sheriff. Jay Mohr is excellent as the rather timid school teacher who fears for his students safety. The supporting cast is also good, most notably Candy Clark as Murphy's slightly odd mother.Cherry Falls is a film that really got the shaft on its releasing, as it's far superior to a number of the theatrically released slasher-by-the-numbers flicks that where out around the time. Horror fans, before you bother with the likes of Urban Legend (1998), the lousy Valentine (2001) or any sequel, give this one a turn!

146077,"It's difficult not to like this John Hughes movie which explores the relationship between Jefferson Briggs (Bacon) and Kristy (McGovern) from their wedding day till their baby's birth. The movie centers around how Bacon matures to become a responsible family man. The movie is portrayed through the eyes of new graduate Briggs and the audience moves along with his fears, plight and fortunes. Although not entirely original, there are moments throughout that you will empathize and laugh along with, mainly because we all went through this before. This is one of Hughes' definitive films from the 1980s and the music accompanying the movie is great, from Gene Loves Jezebel to Everything But The Girl and Kate Bush. Bacon is hilarious and McGovern gives an understated but effective performance as the wife determined to have a baby. Alec Baldwin is brilliant as Davis McDonald, the devilish best friend of Bacon who tries to dissuade him out of marriage.

146178,"Robert Altman is my favorite American director. I must admit that I have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned: ""Quintet"", if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown-up and beautiful Brigitte Fossey, who was unforgettable as the little girl in ""Forbidden Games""; ""HealtH"", for having Lauren Bacall, Carol Burnett, Alfre Woodard and Glenda Jackson, all in the same cast; ""Popeye"", for that splendid and surreal world, Shelley Duvall's Olive Oyl and the wonderful Malta locations; ""O.C. & Stiggs"", for its proposal of an anti-""adolescents flick""; ""Beyond Therapy"", for all its lunacy and for the presence of Genèvieve Page, who for all her effort to look Parisian chic is taken for a travestite... I have even enjoyed his one-act TV movies, like ""The Dumb Waiter"" and ""The Laundromat"". When there is not much plot to develop in his films, you have wonderful performances, from Burnett, John Travolta, Kim Basinger or Jane Curtin. I perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the United States. It is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated, and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out American prizes and awards. He is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies. He is more of a maverick. So it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about ""The Gingerbread Man"", his most 'mainstream' effort to date and to my knowledge. I did not know there were so many people who thought like Leonard Maltin, who does not like Altman at all. In this case, one may dislike ""The Gingerbread Man"", but for me the reason has more to do with Grisham than with the director-screenwriter. Some of Altman's trademarks are here: improvised dialogue, great performances, a funny lawyers' office with typical irreverent receptionist and secretary. While some people find it boring, I found the first act fascinating, thanks also for the great cinematography by Changwei Gu, the man who shot ""Red Sorghum"", ""Ju Dou"" and ""Farewell My Concubine"". He has a way of showing us the same things we see in other American movies, but under a different light. Through his ""foreigner's gaze"", almost everything seems new and different. In this first act, things were so logical and true! Wait until you get older. You may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as Embeth Davidtz. I know for myself what I have done fascinated by someone who is younger than I am! Then you have Robert Duvall's repellent, menacing and mysterious character, while that Geraldo storm is threatening Savannah. The second act gets a little phony and even funny, because Altman may have conducted it with a grin. I remember laughing aloud in several instances with his ironic remarks. I think he was applying a bit of Brecht, distancing us, preparing us for the third act, which is plain Hollywood pastiche. Altman does it with expertise. Being a wise man, and an intelligent director, luckily he did not fall into the traps of today's action movies. He was directing a tale of lust, greed and death. I was not disappointed a bit with the movie. If I give it a nine instead of 10, it is because of Grisham. The American reader has turned him into a best-selling author. So why complain? Maybe we should thank Altman for showing us the seams in his stories, the dullness, the flatness and the silliness of them all. However, he does it with so much gusto and humor, that I cannot but disagree with the negative comments. For me, these persons saw another movie... And vice versa.",positive,movie

Perhaps the bad reviews are from disgruntled pro frackers, not wanting more bad publicity. I would not describe Slaughterhouse as clichéd, it is a parody.

King Kong versus Godzilla is truly the battle of the ages, between the two most famous monsters. They make the 'Alien' look like a wimp. Akihiko Hirata as Dr. Shigezawa is great in his role even though quite limited. He, as usual, is intelligent and cerebral and his statement, "" or the monster will kill us all"" pretty much sums up the problem they are facing. His presence adds continuity to the film since he was the real hero of the original Godzilla, King of the Monsters. The main female actress is unbearably helpless and is by no means a 'Fay Wray'. The Kong suit is ridiculously poor but who cares. I guess Kong is supposed to be the good guy in this flick if either can be considered good. I loved the scene where Dr. Johnson, paleontologist(?), holds up the text book to compare Godzilla to a T-Rex and a stegosaurus. The book just has to be a part of the kids Golden Book series and I loved the when he likened Godzilla's brain to a marble. With 'K'and'G' stepping on everything in sight, I always wonder why it never seems to hurt their feet. The native girl that does the lead dancing on the island is the prettiest Japanese woman I have ever seen and in my view should have been the key actress.

Representatives and supporters of previous government (PO - civic platform) undermine the truth of the plot, because most of the faults were made by them.

It claims to have discovered and refined the long sought after technology that can assist a person to move out of his current condition and evolve to higher states of being within his own lifetime.Sounds good. I'm going to look into it further.I highly recommend this short film to anyone who has strong interest in learning more about Scientology or spiritual development in general.At the very least its an enlightening experience presented in a high quality fashion",positive,movie
147641,"There was a quality to this that may pass some people over. It had a distinct flavour - a movie that combined crime, comedy & a crime theme. If you can hack that concept you are in for a treat. It is a brilliantly written and made movie with, well what can you say? Great looking actors who act the part! The humour was transatlantic in that it certainly should appeal to an international audience. This was (oddly for a crime themed story) a bright, cheery and uplifting movie. In making this writer and makers have carried of quiet a difficult task and have accomplished it well. It is a really original work and owing to the mixed genre aspect a challenging task to carry out well. It is something that I will have on my list of movies to put on when I have gusts round and need to entertain them (I do this to enjoy their reactions). It deserves its stars!",positive,movie
147847,"This classic, vintage 60s dramatization of the first three joyful mysteries of the holy rosary is skillfully and reverently portrayed. This is excellent family, catholic teaching and entertainment, simply yet skillfully told through light, sound, music, and dialogue. As a family prays the rosary in their home around the Christmas tree, the viewer is drawn into the meditations of their prayer, as the action segues into scriptural dramatizations of The Annunciation, The Visitation, and the Nativity of Jesus. An even balance of actual scripture and realistic, created dialogue moves the story along reverently and dramatically. The acting is solid, a testament to skilled players of the time, honing their craft. The minimal use of special effects are simply and effectively done, and the music score is beautiful and traditional as one would expect from that era. Costuming is wonderful. Set design is minimal at times but always appropriate, artistic, and believable. Perhaps most interesting is the way the film portrays ancient customs and behavior, as in the wedding scene. The Catholic teaching is solidified in the end with a priest's heartfelt summary and sending forth. This is a must see for any one of faith, if only for educational reasons, but for me it is a nostalgic, heartwarming film to enjoy during the Christmas season. I thank EWTN for broadcasting it.",positive,movie

148236,"This is one of the best horror films I have seen in ages. Whilst you can detect elements of other films running through it it was powerful enough and different enough to be original. It was one of those films I kept wanting to end - not because I was bored but because I wanted to know what was going on and how it would resolve itself. I think I will take a few watches to really get my head around it but that is in no way a bad thing. Very few horror films leave me thinking or stay with me like this one did. It is in now way ""mental floss"". The production was flawless and the cinematography looked like it came from a multi million pound budget.10/10 from me.",positive,movie

My dad absolutely loved this movie as much as the young crowd did. It is hilariously funny,witty and is the funniest movie (along with CLICK) of the summer. If you want entertainment this is it. This movie blows away some of the big studio films such as SYRIANA,BABEL,HUDSON HAWK and JUDGE DREDD just to name a few. You have 3 very beautiful women as the 3 Swedes (including Aubree Lemon from Deal or No Deal).Taylor Negron is very funny as the Russian. Diane Delano gives her usual better than most performance.

Which is where the writers were coming from. It also may have behooved the project to actually cast actors in the lead roles. Wynne may also benefit himself in the future by finding a way to shoot less than 350 set-ups a day. A shame when you consider what might have been. All in all, a disappointment for fans of the Giant Scorpion film genre. We're still waiting.",positive,movie
149464,"I really quite enjoyed this movie.  Its completely over-the-top bravado impressed me.  Be warned though, if you take Batman seriously then you shouldn't watch.  But for the majority of us, the non-anally retentive people, then this movie is a lot of fun and well worth a rental.The villains were very cool in this one, and we had FOUR!!  Arnie got better as the film went on.  He was a real hoot.  Uma was totally over-the-top and crazy as Poison Ivy.  She was funny and extremely hot!  There was also Bane as Ivy's sidekick who was funny whenever he appeared even though (and probably because) nothing he said ever made any sense!  Then there was Bane's creator, Dr Woodrue played by John Glover with probably the best performance of the film.  I wish he could have been in more of it.The heroes weren't so flash though.  Alicia Silverstone was spunky as Batgirl but the title characters, Batman and Robin as played by Clooney and O'Donnell were pretty lame.  Batman was made to say too many corny one-liners.  This should have been left to the villains, it suits them.  It definitely didn't suit Batman.  Robin was just flat out annoying.  Michael Gough as Alfred actually gives quite a good dramatic performance in amongst all the campiness, I'm not sure why he bothered.The SFX were great.  The weren't at all realistic which was the way it was intended to be you fools!  The whole film is dazzling on the eyes, whether it be the sets or the aray of good looking actors and actresses.  Too put together a film of this large of a scale is quite an achievement.  Anyone who says that Schumacher isn't a good director, doesn't know anything about directing films.This is definitely one of the best no-brainer films of recent years.  To all you people who are pining for the miserable Burton Batmans, get stuffed. Burton made his two movies, if you like them so much, then go and watch THEM.  Schumacher has now made his two films to appeal to a different audience.  Now it's probably time to see what someone else will do with the franschise.  I can't wait.8/10 - Terrific fun.",positive,movie

It was not as fall out of your seat funny without Eddie Murphy but I give Kyla Pratt a big round of applause for even attempting the lead role in a movie that starred Eddie Murphy. She did an excellent job and the movie was very predictable but fun to watch. My 2 year old even sat still to watch it because of all the different animals in the movie. Its definitely more of a kids/teenage movie unlike the first two where adults and children got a kick out of it. Kyla is truly growing as an actress she really showed her dynamics of serious and comedian. Its basically her facial expressions that get the job done. Awesome movie/Great Job Kyla.",positive,movie
150165,"Smosh: The Movie offers everything you could want in a comedy - slapsticky physical humor, relatable characters, and moments of genuine emotion - all liberally dosed with the inside jokes and tongue-in-cheek trademarks characteristic of the Smosh franchise. If you're already a fan of Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla, this will be the best thing you've seen all year. If, on the other hand, you're not familiar with Smosh, you owe it to yourself to explore their universe! Smosh has a unique comedy point of view that will make you by turns laugh, cringe, and applaud, and this film is purely devoted to their irreverent aesthetic. The characters are extremely endearing and their on screen journey is witty, exciting, and rewarding. In a world filled with media created by huge entertainment conglomerates, this film stands out for being true to the spirit of its creators. In short, I love Smosh: The Movie and, if you give it a chance, so will you!",positive,movie

The climax; when the town is about to explode in a nuclear holocaust, a tornado is baring down on a over-turned car that is leaking gasoline and sitting on the edge of a cliff, with a young girl in it, when Jake heroically put himself in harms way to save the girl, who was his ex-girlfriend, just in time before the car plummets over the cliff.

But, it never really billed itself as having a plot. It has a loose enough plot to deliver breasts and gore, and that is really all that this promised to deliver.If you watched it for any other reason than breasts and gore... you need to rethink what movies like this are about.So, what you have is breasts and gore. The movie is about breasts and gore. All you can expect from this is breasts and gore.If you like breasts, this is the movie for you. If you like gore, this is the movie for you.If you are looking for a plot and an actual story... why on earth are you considering watching this movie? This will not be the movie for you. Stay away.

I saw it with a group of friends expecting a made for TV flop, but was pleasantly surprised to be scared out of my wits. i was on the ground almost in tears for a quarter of the film. The characters were believable, minus a few corny quotes: ""I'm the best insurance you've got."" , ""We need more firepower!"" ""I don't know what you are talking about!?! I am a very wealthy man, this isn't what it looks like."" The literal translation to the Spanish word ""chokeberry"" is ""goat sucker"" this movie shows the ""chokeberry"" as a savage beast thirsty for blood, and lots of it.And of course the ""chokeberry"" mask/ costume was very realistic. the graphics were a little sketchy but the compelling plot made up for what the visual effects lacked. It was a gory film with lots of blood. I do not recommend this movie for squeamish land lubbers. A terrifying flick to watch with friends. Just remember to lock up your goats!",positive,movie

If the producers wanted to, they could have added everything from the book, and it would have definitely have been NC-17. I can only hope that the director's cut is released on blu-ray. I am also quite sure that the film has a low rating on IMDb due to its supposed ""filthy nature."" However, I assure you that this film is no worse than shows on HBO, like True Blood, or Dexter.For those of you who refuse to give the film a chance, shame on you, never judge a book by its cover, or the film its made into. It is definitely no worse in context than the Twilight Saga! It is nice to see Melanie Griffith's daughter Dakota in such a provocative role, shows shes really out to make a star of herself. She is completely captivating as Ana Steele. Dornan as Grey, however, I was not enthused with, as I think they could've made a better choice there.The love scenes are very tastefully done, nothing like pornographic like many are saying.

Well I think he is an excellent comedian 10 out of 10 If you don't like the film it's not Stallone's fault its more likely the director due to the fact that they actually invent the story not the actors (BEAR THAT IN MIND!!!)

This movie was amazing, although its sequels were horrible and very disappointing. (havely because Gerald Butler did not portray Dracula in the sequels) so strap on your crucifix's cause this movie was AMAZING and will take you for a ride! This movie was excellent in many ways. First off, the plot.....was awesome. It was a new take on Dracula without losing the old feel for it and disregarding the legend.

But let's not forget that ingeniously craft remain the first choice of an average Indian moviegoer to this day. And READY serves the same dish with a fresh . Pack in humor, stir some peppy music 'Character Dheela' and 'Dhinka Chika' and add the star power of Salman... the outcome is one delicious, scrumptious, yummy dish called READY. But here's a word of caution. READY is NOT for the rigid detractors or counterfeit scholars of Hindi cinema who masquerade as messiah of meaningful cinema. They rebuke films, ridicule big stars, detest anything and everything associated with 'commercial cinema' -- a genre cherished by a wide majority of audiences. They wrote off DABANGG which recently won the coveted National Award, pulled down the super entertainer GOLMAAL 3, scoffed at YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA the biggest hit of 2011 so far, even panned the iconic 3 IDIOTS which ranks as the biggest grosser of Hindi cinema, but these films had the mandate of the junta and that's what matters eventually.

152859,"This is Coppola cum David Lynch. In fact, if this were directed by Lynch it would be hailed as a return to form from the master of the surreal, however Coppola can't seem to catch a break. I've been a big fan of his revitalized art-house film making, admiring Youth Without Youth, and really loving Tetro. Here he continues the trend with a surreal film right up the Twin Peaks alley. It is gorgeously shot, the dream sequences are visually astounding, Coppola playing with blacks and whites, and touches of vivid color, providing a lucid experience. What's more is that this is an extremely personal film for Coppola, with themes of selling out as an artist, losing a child, and confronting failure. It has some great acting, providing Val Kilmer with is first decent role since Felon, and much to his own surprise, he still has it. He is in turns funny, but also hopeless and adrift. Drunk, tired, and distracted as the bargain basement Stephen King. When he roles into town to sign books at a hardware store, the local sheriff ropes him into the haunted towns history. Through a series of strange experiences, and lucid fever dreams (a drunken dream inspired the film) he uncovers the dark secrets of the town, meets Poe, and confronts his long buried feelings.

I wish to assert that ""Ghoulies"" is so hilariously stupid, that it deserves as much recognition as ""Citizen Kane"".Anyway, this is one of those cheap horror flicks that you just gotta love.

It doesn't bother me to see the negative side of family, I have a family with a lot of drama and negative and violent things happened to at least one of us. It's reality for some people. I think that's what Tyler Perry draws on. With God, we can hold on to the hope and promise of something better. That's why I buy his movies and plays, he is not shy about sharing God's word, even if at it's misquoted by Madea. Tyler Perry produces entertaining morality plays. Why do people get upset that it is NOT high art? Other movies are fluff and fun and don't have a decent message. At least Tyler Perry gives us a nice message with the silliness. I appreciate the fact that Tyler brings humor into people's lives. I've always seen the ability to make others laugh as one of the most precious gifts a person could have. This world needs more happiness; I know I could use a good laugh daily. Tyler has created a character or two who can be a little over the top -zany - but as a whole I enjoy his work. Laughter is only one thing his films bring to my life. What I like most is the lessons he teaches with his movies. When she's not acting crazy and going off on people, Madea shares words of wisdom that can reach my heart like a good Bible teaching. (Don't ask her about The Bible, though, because she is not very good at interpreting Scripture). And even when Madea doesn't play a part in a movie, somebody is going to say something thought-provoking. I have All of Tyler Perry's plays on DVD.

I will say that the only reason I even went was because one of my closest friends practically forced me into it.What I found was that I could not be happier with a movie. After his work in the batman franchise, Christian Slater did a wonderful job keeping me on the edge of my seat. In fact, if I had to guess, I'd say his work in this film might be the most realistic, believable acting job in recent history, far surpassing Christian's former costar, Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight.My only beef about the film was that it was sometimes hard to follow the intricate movements of the actor's index fingers, although I suppose its not fair to deduct points for something that I assume is a rare fetish that is only shared by complete sociopaths and a large percentage of field mice.",positive,movie

I think it might help if you love the ocean to begin with, as I do. I found myself crying in two places and my children who viewed it: ages 3,4 and 13, all loved it. A G rating is a great change of pace. This is a children's film and the subtle aspects that are for adults are not the snickering b.s. prevalent in recent years films. This film received an award of excellence from the film advisory board and I think it is well earned.If you're a cynic looking to pick things a part, you shouldn't be watching this anyway. I wanted to be entertained and I was. The animation was it's weakest link, and I'd still give the animation a B+ for quality. This film had depth (hee, hee) and humor and compassion and with the crop of junk that passes for entertainment out there I couldn't pass on the opportunity to speak up and encourage others to watch it. A question to all of you with your scathing comments:Why do you spend your time tearing a part the creative efforts of others? This was a lovely film and it is original and creative, two rare things these days. Take a bow little fishies...",positive,movie
154240,"True Rating is 8/10 (gotta offset all these 1 Stars)Like always, most if not ALL of the negative reviews belong to viewers who jump to conclusions. People blinded by nostalgia and comparing multiseries sagas to an ongoing series with one season.""It's not better than Clone Wars...!
"" It's not better than Rebels...!""*Sigh* here we go again!The Star Wars hate train rolls into town! You know, the SAME EXACT hate train that ran its course when TCW started or when Rebels started. I remember how Rebels had a score of 6.9/10 when it first came out but now holds a solid 8/10. I remember how people flocked to hate TCWs only to lick its feet once the show was concluding. (Seriously, will this trend ever end?)I hate to say I told you so--not really--but I can guarantee you in two-three years tops, you'll see the hate train for Resistance vanish into the void yet again.Honestly, the first episode of Resistance was a step in the right direction (I can see the haters shaking their heads all ready). It was also handled a lot better than TCWs and or Rebels opening episodes.Just go back and watch the very first episodes of TCW or Rebels... they are absolutely horrid. The animation style was worse than PS2 graphics, the characters were bland and robotic... the action sequences were a big 'meh.' In a nutshell, they sucked. Neither show caught its stride into later in its development.Resistance's opening two-episodes, while slow, does deliver a lot in its short run time. The outpost station in the middle of an ocean planet is a very unique setting. The magnitude of aliens and the cutthroat society on the fringe of civilization is a great starting point.It's refreshing to get a Star Wars story that doesn't center around a Jedi, the Force, a Bounty Hunter or any of that. We finally get a Star Wars show that details the average galactic citizens' lives and their livelihoods.The protagonist, Kazuda, is all right, but man can he be insufferably annoying at times. There was one episode where he doesn't know what droid fuel is (despite being around/working alongside droids 24/7). Droids are basically the smartphones of the Star Wars universe, so how the hell does this kid not know what droid fuel is??? That's like someone not knowing what a laptop charger is in our world.The other characters are fine and I definitely see a lot more development heading their way in the foreseeable future.Personally, the animation style doesn't bother me much. For once it fits the mood of the story being told without coming off tonally inconsistent. This particular Star Wars show is more a comedy than its predecessors, to many fan's distaste.Be patient and give the show a deservable chance. TCW and Rebels started out slow, drawn out and boring but went out with a bang. Let this show grow so that it may do the same.",positive,movie
154286,"I've now seen it twice and I really loved Ravager. Yes, it was made with modest resources, and that is visible, but it accomplishes all of the important things a film in this series should accomplish. It explores a story about how fear manifests when faced with terribly difficult realities.I love how the first film is about a young person coping with the deaths of their family, and Ravager is about an aging person coping with the loss of their memories as they face death. I love that full-circle, complementary nature of it. Without spoiling, I love that the Tall Man undergoes a real kind of transformation in it. In fact, it might be the most humanistic film in the whole series.I just really think the movie was made with real care and understanding of the heart of Phantasm. I'd much rather see a low- budget film that really gets it, than a higher-budget film that doesn't.So, in summary, Ravager is totally in the spirit of the films and gives tons to think about. If you're watching it and just griping about CGI, you're probably not watching Phantasm for what I consider the right reasons. This is really a film for people who love the first four films, and for us, it is a solid, sentimental payoff. I really appreciated all four previous films and now I love the fifth as well.And if you're writing a review that treats the series as literal narrative, and you are complaining that your literal narrative questions were not answered, please back away from the Phantasm movies slowly, because you are likely to trip over your own shoelaces.",positive,movie

Mr. Chow the mean and straightforward china man manage to steal all the gold from Marshall and Alan helping him without knowing. It's just so hilarious!When it comes to acting, I believe they all have developed their techniques and have become really good actors.

An apocalyptic film isn't exactly a new or unique idea but this one still pulled it off. If you're a bit of an action-junkie like myself, you'll probably like this one with its non-stop action right through the film. While some of it may seem a little over the top, it is what it is. A ""Rock"" action film. I also didn't mind the rest of the cast in their roles and everyone seemed to pull their weight. If you liked movies such as 2012 and Day After Tomorrow, just want to watch something and enjoy an action-packed movie then you should give this one a go.",positive,movie
154468,"It's been almost five years since this film came out back in 1998. I can remember the very first TV Spot on television around New Years. As a HUGE Godzilla fan I was excited to say the least. And I must tell you, when I saw it when it finally came out I wasn't dissapointed, and to this day I still feel the same way.It's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does. It shows me that the majority of the people (and Godzilla fans) that take the time to write reviews for films probably don't know what they are talking about when they talk of America's ""Godzilla"".There are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself, 'Godzilla'.If you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks, you aren't going to find a great (not to mention BELIEVABLE) story or plot. I realize this, even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' atleast, in my opinion, had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. And if the story was slightly dull to some of you, you should let it pass. Remember what 'Godzilla' is about, afterall.And what was wrong with the monster itself, Godzilla? Nothing. If you get two action figures, one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in alot of ways. They both have the spikes, gigantic size, and famous roar. The major differences being the skin color, face, and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's looks. I mean, I love the old Godzilla look, it may be silly to some, but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a creature that had big 'googily' eyes and flying around on his tail kicking monsters, it would have ended up being a laugh-fest at the theaters.What the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original, that satisfies the audience. It was just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? Devlin and Emmerich came up with a monster that was realistic. Something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. Something the Japanese audience accepts, but the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.I personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical blasting from G Fans and Critics that got alot of attention, unfortunately, and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really that people can't enjoy this film.This is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big, Loud, and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects, there's nothing quite like it.So take a look at it, be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic pop-corn entertainment known as ""GODZILLA"".",positive,movie

Well the plot follows the same logic used in the previous movies,great action scenes,some funny parts,special effects are great and at least we don't have someone surviving to a nuclear bomb inside a refrigerator neither the writers of this movie confuse Peru(Incas)with Mayas(Guatemala),actually in this movie China is not Japan.China is China which means this team made a good research.

All the creators did was insert a fictional, believable love story in a historical setting. The writing and acting were good and convincing, but not Oscar-worthy. The action scene choreography and cinematography were stellar. The special effects appeared natural versus over-computerized, and really added to the suspense. Glimpses of the famous ashen corpses are included. The horsemanship and ""6th sense"" of those animals were delightful. I'd love watching it again and owning it. Fun and entertaining!",positive,movie

This is a fictional look at mythology so it doesn't have to follow rules like skin colour of characters or that the pyramids aren't that close to the Nile. I mean come on, it shows the world as flat. People complain just to complain.I really hope there is a sequel to this as we need movies that aren't reboots and aren't books made into movies.It was an easy to follow storyline and I didn't spot any major plot holes which is nice.

Jessica Alba and Paul Walker give convincing performances, and Scott Caan provides some much needed comic relief. The unique thing about this scuba flick is the footage is simply stunning. Nearly every shot in this film is beautiful, above or under water. And I'm not just referring to the camera pans up and down buff bodies.

155370,"As a huge fan of the Karate Kid trilogy, you'll have to excuse me while I give my first sentimental statement ever on IMDb. I believe in my heart that in that parallel universe where our favorite characters from film still live, that Kumiko and Daniel would be together today. Either Daniel would have gone to Okinawa to be with Kumiko or Kumiko would have come to the States to be with Daniel. Of course, we learn in Karate Kid Part III that Kumiko decided not to go with Daniel back to California. But in my mind, this is insignificant and has no negative implication for their future. Sure, they both would have had relationships with other people. But having been through what they experienced together, they would not soon forget the bond between them. You wouldn't forget someone that saved your life? Compared to Ali from Part I and Jessica from Part III, it is more than apparent that Kumiko was the love of Daniel's life. Whether it be two years or ten years after the end of Part III, Kumiko and Daniel would have eventually reconnected and continued to live their lives together.

155412,"Both Escape from New York and Escape from L.A. are decidedly anti-establishment films. They both have this cynical view of the government; in these films, the government is not to be trusted. There are terrorist attacks aimed at the government on both films. ESCAPE FROM L.A This second one is tongue in cheek every step of the way. Watching Escape from L.A. feels like watching a cheap Italian Rip Off like 2019: After the Fall of New York (1983), but with a bigger budget. Actually, Escape from L.A. has a lot of similarities with 2019: After the Fall of New York, so in a way, this is Carpenter's pay back for all those cheap Escape from New York rip offs that the Italians made. Ultimately, I love both Escape from New York and Escape from L.A. for different reasons. And for all the tonal differences between both films, they still have many similarities. No matter where, Snake Plissken will always be Snake Plissken, you can tell Russell has lots of love for this character. Plissken is what kept me watching. The opening and closing segments of the films are extremely similar as well. And here's where we get to the best part of the film, the ending. Not gonna spoil it don't worry, but I will tell you that it is the best thing about the movie. Russell himself came up with it and I applaud him for it, it encapsulates everything Snake Plissken is in terms of attitude. That idea that maybe the world would be better off if we simply started again, from scratch, screw the way things are, let's try something new! Welcome to the human race my friends, welcome to the human race.t does criticize fascist forms of government, it also criticizes rebellious leaders who instigate their followers towards committing violent acts. So it doesn't side with anyone. On this film, both sides are wrong. The film pleads for a new beginning, it's asking governments to forget their old grudges and start from scratch. Snake himself says it in one scene: ""I shut down the third world, you win, they loose. I shut down America, they win, you loose. The more things change, the more they stay the same"" This is one of the ideas presented in the film that I truly liked. The idea that both sides should just call it quits and bring on the peace, bring on the freedom. Again, this last bit demonstrates how much of Kurt Russell's Libertarian views are on this film. After all, he wrote a lot of it himself along with John Carpenter and Debra Hill. These are three life long buddies writing a movie they would find amusing, which makes this film a labor of love. This is probably why the film has a more laid back, 'were having fun here' vibe to it.",positive,movie
155451,"A very pleasing all-around movie is how I found this Knights Of The Roundtable-type story and a good one for DVD, even one that's been on disc for quite some time. For an early DVD, this was a real treat for the ears with some great rear- speaker sound. The story, however, not the sound, was the main appeal of this film for me.The three main stars in this movie were very appealing: Richard Gere as the cocky-but-good guy Sir Lancelot; Julia Ormond as Guinevere and Sean Connery, aptly cast as King Arthur. He certainly looks and acts the part, as does Ben Cross as the villain, Prince Malagant.This is a straight adventure story, too, with none of the hocus-pocus sorcery baloney who often see in these King Arthur stories. This is beautifully filmed with a city of Camelot that is awesome to view. Nice values in here, too, with - gasp - the importance of prayer mentioned. No wonder so many reviewers out there hated this message.This is simply a classy, great adventure and highly recommend to literally everyone who values a nice story that has values.",positive,movie

Open Water is a film aimed at a realistic account of a couple left out in the ocean and the emotions, struggles, and challenges brought about by that situation. Open Water is more of a drama than a horror film. Some may find it boring because of its lack of detailed dialogue and action. It is like a Hemmingway short story.

The way in which he delivers his lines are priceless and humorous in themselves no matter what the line even is. He definitely was an impressive part of the film.The overall storyline is so ridiculously absurd that it makes the film that much more humorous. It achieves what it set out to do and that is be a comedy that requires absolutely no deep thought on the audience's part but will definitely keep you entertained and laughing.

Robin Shou was also integral to this movie and I appreciate his role in this movie much more than his terrible and embarrassing role in the Mortal Kombat movies.

Hopefully you will not allow the multitude of bigots on IMDb prevent you from enjoying this amazing moving. I suggest checking the poster's history however, when people make statements such as the previous Annie ""Was so beautiful and fair"" or ""How can we believe he is rich with that ghetto accent"" their racism shines through like a meteor in a dark alley. These folks have a pattern of giving low ratings to all movies with African American leads. In fact, many of these comments are almost laughable. Um, how can we believe Jamie Foxx is rich? Perhaps because he IS actually rich in real life and by the way he didn't grow up in a ghetto. It is nice to fact check outside of one's tiny head prior to posting. IMHO",positive,movie
156496,"If I had my way, a movie/story should have a plot sequence that goes something like this. First a hook in the opening scenes, then establish the characters. After this, present at least 2 or 3 ways where the conflict can go. Once these are done, then allow the plot and the protagonists to move where the struggle begs for a resolution. The conflict then gets focused on how the same gets resolved into a proper release for the questions created in the earlier scenes. Alex Cross goes through these motions cleanly. The good guys and the bad guys are identified relatively fast. They meet, the weapons are identified, the arena is clear, they struggle and then the winners are declared.

156525,"When she was still young and gorgeous, Jane Fonda got the starring role in Barbarella. Barbarella is the main character in this film, who's on a space mission to locate Durand-Durand, a villain who's trying to take over the world. Barbarella wears outrageously sexy outfits, travels in a wildly decorated spaceship, and meets many strange creatures along the way, that she has to do battle with. Barbarella's sex appeal is off-the-charts, and this film is oozing with a piping-hot erotic ambiance. Interestingly though, Barbarella has sex with other characters, in a most futuristic way. She takes a pill to 'tune-in' to her partner's psyche. And no bodily contact takes place during this sort of 'sex', except hand-clasping. Apparently, orgasm is achieved when the sex partners complete an ecstatic fusion, of their minds and souls. However, Barbarella does enjoy a sexual tryst via the 'old-fashioned way', with a man she meets during her travels.Jane Fonda was brilliantly cast as the heroic, buxom Barbarella. Her on-screen charisma, is vibrant and compelling. Milo O'Shea as the evil Durand-Durand, does a decent job in his role. So does John Phillip Law, as the pure and gentle angel, Pygar. His perfect body and square-jawed, handsome face, made him a devilishly attractive 'angel'. Anita Pallenberg played the Great Tyrant, with femme fatale relish. The lesbian sexual undertones between her and Barbarella, were absolutely sizzling.One of the best things about this movie, is the incredible special effects and gadgetry. Long before the flashy Star Wars series premiered, Barbarella contained some amazingly creative costumes, decorations, and scenery in general. The overall tone of this film, was deeply influenced by the uninhibited adventurous spirit, of the late 60s. Especially with regards to its bold, exciting sexual themes. For those who are Jane Fonda fans, and/or are devotees of 60s SciFi films, Barbarella is a fun-filled, juicy slice of 60s camp psychedelia.",positive,movie

156557,"Leatherheads takes place in the 1920's and is about a professional football player named Dodge Connolly who is also the head coach of his team. Dodge's team soon loses sponsorship and they are forced to resign. Being out of work, Dodge soon reads about an up and coming war hero and college football star named Carter Rutherford who he convinces to play on the team and because of Carter's star power, Dodge soon gets the team up and running again. Meanwhile a reporter named Lexie Littleton is going to be writing an article on Carter and soon Dodge meets her and falls in love with her and after first being turned off by him, Lexie soon starts to like him as well, but things get complicated when Lexie uncovers something for her story on Carter, that could hurt him and the team and Dodge, with feelings for Lexie soon has to straighten things out with his love and his team. Even though the film is called Leatherheads, and most of the advertisements show the film as a sports film, really the football aspect is only a backdrop to the romantic comedy part of the film that is really the main focus. The filmmakers of Leatherheads, must have been big fans of the romantic ""screwball"" comedies of the 1930's and 40's and this is truly a salute and tribute to those movies. That being said, Leatherheads captures everything about those films and the charm, wittiness, comedic performances and style that made those films so distinct. The film's look from the sets right down to the costumes look exactly like the 20's films and in capturing the mood of the 40's comedies the writers have provided a very humorous story filled with snappy and clever dialogue between the characters, numerous situations that resolve themselves with a lot of comedic intelligence and first rate performances from the actors who all do their best job of capturing the comedic performances of that era. Leatherheads works so well because it appeals and does it's job so well for a couple of reasons. First off the story and writing is sharp, funny and tells a very entertaining story with a great backdrop and sets from the crew and also because of the performances, timing and skill of the actors delivering the lines and situations to perfection and doing the best of what they are given and what they are given is very good. Overall a classic tribute to the comedies of yesteryear done with perfection and told with a great knack for such films and delivering a very entertaining, funny and classy film that I think will appeal to many people and will work on the same levels that they worked for me.",positive,movie

After breaking up with her boyfriend and losing her job, Elizabeth returns to her mother's house.

Phoebe Cates, who plays Elizabeth, now has a whole new load of trouble on her hands. Fred is her childhood imaginary friend - and only she can see him! There are so many funny parts in this film, it's impossible to name them all, but Rik Mayall never fails to bring up the laughs in any scene, as he gives a highly energetic, enthusiastic performance. The ending is really touching and I can never forget how when I was younger I always got upset by it. It beautifully concludes the movie, and will make you feel warm inside.

Most endings to book made into movies are so horrible but Hunger Games Part 2 was not a disappointment to me. Everything they did was exactly what I wanted them to do. They added on a little extra ending part and didn't have to but I was already completely satisfied by that time that it didn't even matter and thought it was kinda cute they even did that. It played with my emotions perfectly and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the series.

157815,"Annihilation is based on a novel of the same name by Jeff Vandermeer, a writer specialized in a literary sub-genre known as ""weird fiction"". This book is the first from a 
trilogy; however, director-screenwriter Alex Garland (""Ex Machina"") wrote this adaptation before the next two books were even published. 
It follows the story of a Lena, a biologist with military background, whose life has been shattered by the disappearance of her soldier husband who had gone on a secret 
mission into an ecological disaster area presumably harboring an alien presence. Lena will be recruited as part of a scientific expedition into the unknown that will try 
to find some answers. As someone who have read the books, I appreciate the way the director has made this story his own, taking enough from the book to make the story 
recognizable, but at the same time making his own interpretations and connections, expanding on its themes and characters. There is much wonder, weirdness and visual poetry 
to be found in the beautiful and exceptionally well crafted film, and to my surprise there is also plenty body horror and sudden outbursts of gnaly monster action.
The movie weaves different timelines in a very seamless way, with a combination of economy and elegance that is both eloquent and easy to follow; this makes it possible to introduce 
different layers of meaning within the narrative (psychological, scientific, philosophical), and to tackle big themes without becoming pretentious or obtuse. The film contains 
memorable dialogue not included in the original novel and the characters are much more fleshed out (the conversation between the biologist and the psychologist about the 
nature of self destruction is a highlight, and a pivotal moment).
This is a project where you can clearly appreciate the simbiotic relationship between two highly imaginative thinkers (perhaps the best collaboration since Kubrick and Arthur
C. Clarke in ""2001: An Space Odyssey""). ""Annihilation"" represents the type of reflexive science fiction that ponders about our place in the cosmos, our intrinsic mutability,
and the horrors this conjures; it amounts to a surreal, sciency phantasmagoria about desintegrating identity, deeply rooted in cosmic horror. And I have no words to describe that climax apart from saying it left me in complete awe. This is 
for sure a new sci-fi classic that consolidates Garland as one of the major sci-fi visionaries of our time.",positive,movie
157970,"I just saw the movie in the cinema here in Manila and I must say I was happily surprised. Unlike the so called 'professional' critics I really enjoyed the plot, characters and visuals of this exciting film.I'm not sure what the critics expected, perhaps another fantasy classic? Maybe they have been too spoiled over the last few years by fantasy masters such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Game of Thrones series and even the enjoyable (but rather underwhelming) Hobbit series.Video game adaptations to the big screen rarely turn out good. This movie is an exception. It's not a cinema classic by any means, but you won't regret paying full price at your local theatre either. I agree that some of the acting could have been better and that some parts of the story could have been fleshed out more. Considering the budget they had to work with, however, I'm still completely convinced that the production team did a sterling job. Enjoy the movie for what it is: a faithful adaptation of Warcraft's early history with decent actors and delightful visuals. Go watch it, you won't regret it.For the Alliance! For the Horde!",positive,movie
158306,"I Love You, Man is a delightful film not just for its brand of humour which worked almost all the time, nor because it stars the bunch of contemporary jokers who have taken Hollywood by storm, but because it had a meaningful story to tell, and has translated that key insight of friendships and relationships for the big screen effortlessly, wrapping up some deep, intrinsic behavioural observation deceptively behind a curtain of laughter.Like the 40 Year Old Virgin in its quest for a woman to get laid with to pop his cherry, this film works on the reverse in its protagonist's quest for a male friend, since Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) has no problems with female friendship as he's the quintessential ladies man, only that he's about to marry his fiancé Zooey (Rashida Jones). Since the bride has a maid of honour, it's up to Peter to find a balance in a best man, only that he hasn't really had a man friend for the longest time, and so begins a crazy montage of hooking up with casual friends in the hope of striking gold.It might seem like a hypothetical situation, but as the film progressed, it brings to mind how many of us have friends (male or female) that we sometimes take for granted in knowing that they'll always be there for us. Only a reality check brings up the fact that everyone has their own personal lives to lead, and it wouldn't be nice to impose (mid-life crisis singles, hands up here), especially not with an ulterior motive. Some of us too when having a girlfriend, tend to allow male friends to fall on the wayside as we skirt chase, and depending on whether you get someone who provides that much leeway as Zooey, you can kiss goodbye to those male-bonding sessions.Then there's the difference between the premise of a girl's night out, and a guy's, and the dynamics of what happens within the groups. It can be somewhat stereotypical here in the film, but you get the drift as the film lays it all out on the table, with the girls talking about the boy-stuff behind their backs, and the worst bit being that cause for comparison, and the guys, well, talk about what else, sex! There are some lines clearly drawn here in what can, or cannot be discussed, and how much of that you can bring to the table, and how much you can take away from. A secret's a secret, and should stay that way with clear segregation in order to prevent upsetting anyone. Talk about compromises and ""truth"".If what you're saying is that it reeks of hypocrisy, then yes, sometimes it does, and the married couple played by Jaime Pressly and Jon Favreau (yes, he who directed Iron Man) epitomizes the crankiness of a marriage with its idiosyncrasies, and the hypocrisies that come with presenting a united front, and worse of all, trading favours in both directions. They have some of the best lines and insane moments in the film, and poor Jon has got to suffer two verbal abuses (for you to watch and find out).Many of us who have remembered Jason Segel's comical turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and here he cuts his Sydney Fife both ways, one an alpha male type who seems way cool with his frat boy sensibilities, which is actually a facade for a lonely life he leads in his garage where he can be the man he actually is. As the friendship between Peter and Sydney grow from their numerous hanging out sessions, from short drinking sessions to weekend rendezvous just to jam to their favourite tunes, so too does the strain in Peter and Zooey's relationship, because as the saying goes, two's a company, and three's a crowd. This aspect serves as an adversary in the film, though it doesn't come unexpected when it suddenly dawns upon Peter that he can't have two birds in one hand. Being the novice in this aspect of a man-friend relationship here, there are many times Peter trips up, and the experienced us would know that it's perfect danger territory to find yourself in.And who would have thought friendship and relationships could be such a chore, especially when expectations start flying around being that spanner ready to be thrown in the works. As a comedy, this film hit plenty of right spots in eliciting laughter from the audience, with funny lines that do work, and carefully crafted characters in Peter (with his nonsensical one- liner conversation endings, and nicknames), and Sydney being quite multi-dimensional. And what's a film like this about man-friends without that dose of fanboy-dom in it, with the Incredible Hulk Lou Ferrigno playing himself in a very short supporting role, and many other film references thrown in for good measure too?I Love You, Man is an excellent story on friendship, and what makes friendship tick. For that and its healthy dose of comedy, and a great spin on the tired romantic-comedy genre, it goes without a surprise into my list of contenders for top films of the year.",positive,movie
158428,"Complain about my score, I don't care. This movie was AWESOME!! It didn't exactly scare me, but it gave me the same feeling I got when I played RE1 for the first time. It was fast and the action barely stopped. It actually felt like survival horror.I thoroughly enjoyed Wesker's role in the movie. I was a little worried about how he would fit in. I know, I know, he did nothing but sit in a chair and talk. He did that in RE4, too. From the games I've played, I thought the producers had his character's attitude perfect. It seems to me they are making him the one who is responsible for everything that has been happening. Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii should cover that, though. As soon as I left the theater, I had the urge to go home play RE4. Which, in my opinion, is what a movie should do. Well, maybe not inspire you to play a game, but at least make you want to play the game that the movie is based on.",positive,movie

Costner is always a variable. When the right script hits, no one is better, otherwise it's pretty much a monotone. FORTUNATELY, this is the kind of script where the dead pan, monosyllabic Good Guy works just fine. It's a shame the ""experts"" (i.e. the critics who create nothing) trashed this one.

The props and real life buildings are also very interesting. One would think that the modern music would be totally out of place in this film, but it made it all the more enjoyable.

""You ain't ever gonna get an Academy Award for doing Crank"" Well I beg to differ; I think an award category should be created for making a film like this.

Jason is superb as Chev Chelios again and had me laughing my ass off with his cockney slang and his superb stunts. One thing I will say, I took my wife with me to see this and all the way through the film she had that ""Could this get anymore ridiculous"" look on her face. Meanwhile I couldn't stop laughing at the fact that the more outrageous this film got, the more I found myself loving it. You know when they say ""A roller-coaster ride of a movie"".

158988,"When I first read in Fangoria magazine that there was going to be a remake of my favorite horror film, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", I was more than a little upset. I was downright p***ed. Then I saw the trailer, and it actually looked scary... damn scary. But I didn't keep my expectations too high because this was a Hollywood remake of an independent horror classic.Man, was I surprised!!! This movie kicked ass! But in totally different - and yet some of the same - ways that the original did. For example; in the original there was practically no gore (with the exception of Leatherface accidentally slicing some meat off his own leg), but the scares came more from the suspense and psychological horror and torture the victims were subjected to. Whereas the remake supplies plenty of gore (not an exploitative amount though) that is used to disturb and scare us. Also there was always an overwhelming sense of dread for what was to become of the victims in the original masterpiece. And the remake keeps that same sense throughout the whole  film.The acting in the first ""Chainsaw"" was pretty good for an independent horror film in the 70's, but this one's got it beat. Jessica Biel is superb as a scream queen. The supporting cast is very effective also.
All in all, this is a perfect horror film. And while it may not replace the original as my favorite... it definitely places in my top ten of horror. I only hope the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake fairs as well (although, with running and jumping zombies instead of slow and lumbering, I have my doubts).1) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)2) The Evil Dead3) Dawn of the Dead (1978)4) Re-Animator5) Return of the Living Dead6) Day of the Dead7) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)8) Zombie9) Cannibal Holocaust10) From Dusk till Dawn",positive,movie
158991,"At first when I saw the previews for the re-make of the Texas Chansaw Massacre I thought it was going to be just another crappy re-make. But after seeing it I found myself scared out of my mind. This film is in fact BETTER than the original. Even though the cliché ending in which at least one character gets away (too many horror movies end like this) I still enjoyed it immensely. Instead of polluting the movie with gore and cheap effects they made the setting almost real and very very very disturbing. And thank god they got the new Leatherface to stop grunting, that was one of my major annoyances of the first movie is you couldn't take it seriously because of all the pig-like noise the killer kept making. Instead of showing you all the atrocities Leatherface has committed (with the help of his family) you get to see strange and horrific elements that terrify your imagination as to what he had done. The basing it on a true story like in the 1st movie was better the 2nd time around because you actually felt like it WAS a true story. This was one of the scariest and terrifying movies I've seen in ages and if someone tells you its not worth seeing, don't take their word for it, GET IT YOURSELF!

159724,"In 1983, two different 007 adventures were released into theaters. One was the official 007, the other was a cheesy impostor. 'Never Say Never Again' was released as ""bond's greatest adventure"" but what many have come to realize is that 'Never Say Never Again' is simply a re- make of 'Thunderball'. Even the return of a much grayer, more tired Sean Connery could not keep this Bond adventure alive, besides the fact that MGM/UA had no part in the production of this film. But another 007 adventure was released that year and to many it is considered the greatest Bond film of all time, 'Octopussy'.'Octopussy' starred Roger Moore in his sixth outing as Agent 007 and was directed by John Glen, the man who also directed Moore's second best Bond film, 'For Your Eyes Only'. Unlike 'FYEO' we return to some of the humor and charm that Moore has always been known for. We also see the return of veteran 'Bond Girl', Maud Adams as Octopussy. The plot in this film is a bit more far fetched then 'FYEO' but it works on all levels. The film is exotic, with Bond traveling to India for the first time in the series, it's also well put together and has enough action and humor to interest new and old fans alike. Many say that Roger Moore was too old for the role but one of the main reasons this film works is because Roger Moore isn't trying to be a young agile Bond like Timmothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan. Moore plays a more mature character, sort-of a veteran secret agent. Everything works in this film and is by far the greatest Roger Moore Bond film and arguably the best film in the entire series. Moore should have played it smart and ended on a high note with 'Octopussy', sort-of a grand finale, rather then extend his career through the abysmal 'A View To A Kill'.",positive,movie

160252,"This is by far in my top three best and funniest movies! An absolutely hilarious film guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.Andy Samberg (from Saturday Night Live) plays Rod Kimble an aspiring stuntman trying to live up to his dead father's legacy, unfortunately he lacks the necessary aspect: any talent whatsoever. But backed by supportive friends.Along with Lonely Island best friends Akiva Shaffer as director and Jorma Taccone as his step-brother team up to create this great comedy equals pure awesomeness! And Bill Hader as a friend and fellow team member Dave made me laugh so much too! From the most epic fall down a hill, safe word ""WHiskey,"" Satan for a stepfather, killer dance moves and a Tai-Chi move guaranteed to make a grown man crap his pants and not know why. Hot Rod is quite the adventure. I would love to live in a town like that.And after this movie you probably won't be able to look at stunting or mopeds the same way again.Be sure to rent or buy this movie and the extras are pretty awesome.""Life is pain - we've got to scrape the joy from it every chance we get.""",positive,movie
160290,"House of 1000 Corpses was well worth the wait. People were understandably a little sceptical of Rob Zombie's debut as a director, but knowing myself that the man is a scholar of the modern horror movie and a raving fanboy himself, I had high expectations of House. I was not disappointed. From the demented and hilarious opening sequence through to the surreal and terrifying ending, Zombie's first foray into direction and writing gives the world of cinema a much needed boot in the pants.Is it gory? Well, yeah, it is, but it's never gory in an absolutely horrific fashion. What's such a pleasant surprise is that the movie, despite being a homage to the bleak and nihilistic 70s horror boom, is full of well-painted, full-bodied characters and rich dark humour. House of 1000 Corpses is an absolute blast to watch, never wallowing in darkness and only really becoming a terror-ride toward the very end, meaning it's a movie that while not for all the family could well put a smile on at least some of their faces.The movies combination of gore-soaked serial-killer horror, Tim Burtonesque visuals and Evil Dead's sense of humour is a fresh turn from a genre currently stuck largely in bleak apartment buildings full of long-faced pouty heroines and even longer-faced pouty ghouls. Yeah it isn't that tense, but it's wickedly funny, wonderfully psychedelic and chock full of demented set-pieces. To be honest, I'd almost forgot what it was like to be entertained by horror before I watched this.A lot of people love to dissect this movie and venerate it's influences, but the bottom line is unlike Kill Bill which relied on you being as nerdy as Tarantino to enjoy it, Zombie's movie is fun whether or not you've seen the movies he doffs his threadbare circus hat to. It's a warped, psychedelic delve into mania that'll make you laugh out loud and keep you on the edge of your seat. Watch it. Watch it ASAP.",positive,movie

160518,"...Wonderful productions, I wonder how much I've been influenced by exposure to the various thumbs of armchair critics. However, there can be little influence from naysayers about this film because I am a true fan of the sword and sandal classics.In retrospect, one wouldn't be surprised that the entire film was shot on green-screen sets, but it was so masterfully (or at least distractedly) done that you don't think about the dramatic skies and wheat fields as piped in. In fact, the entire cg aspect was transparent, which even the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings series had not managed to do completely.The stylization of the effects, such as the radiant glow, deepened shadows, and slow motion sequences, seemed to emphasize the movie's illustrated roots, and though sometimes I found myself wishing I could see clearer, I always found deep satisfaction and immersion in the storyline. I think without the effects the plot would have required more elaboration, and turning a piece of art into another 'Gladiator' look-alike.This movie is going on my keeper list, as I found it very comforting to watch, inspiring, and I will never tire of looking at (finally) scantily clad men, especially Gerard. The kingly figure of Leonidas, cloaked in red as is his Spartiate warriors, reminds me of the warrior class and king from George Nader's sci-fi book 'Chrome'. Romantically idealized, the simplistic portrayal of virtue and honor are purely portrayed by a directly stylized hero.Of course, the villain was just as idealized, and therein is the complaint. Nobody likes a baddie without explanation, and perhaps the studio thought that being a Persian god was explanation enough. I would have enjoyed a much more developed Xerxes, but Ru Paul did a great job on the part. Just kidding. Rodrigo Santoro was superb, as big and evil as the comic portrays, and he does a good job overwhelming the much smaller king of Spartans.The acting was good, and the script solid enough, all in all earning a rating of an 8, but as promised, tanned and bearded men with valor earns it a 10. We need more movies like this.",positive,movie
160549,"""The Revenant"" marks a big turn for both star Leonardo DiCaprio and director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Following up on his roles as maniacal tycoons in ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", DiCaprio plays a fur trapper abandoned in the snowed-in wilderness. It's intense enough knowing that this was a true story, but how they film it makes it even more so. Like ""Birdman"", the movie contains several long shots filmed in a naturalistic style to create a sense of realism. Hugh Glass's determination to survive and find those who abandoned him provides one of the most harrowing stories ever put on screen. Covered in blood, sweat and dirt, DiCaprio spends much of the movie not talking, keeping the focus on his actions. And by actions, I mean that you rarely see something this intense on screen.I'd say that the movie deserved its Golden Globe wins (but it repeatedly irritated me that the presenters kept mispronouncing Alejandro González Iñárritu's name). And while accepting his award, DiCaprio spoke up for the world's indigenous peoples and called on people to protect the environment from corporate interests. Indeed we should heed his call. In the meantime, definitely see ""The Revenant"". It's an experience like you can't imagine.",positive,movie

That along with having great characters/animation/dialog, which you just forget ... or never even consider are digital puppets.The humor was great too, the gags / situations character acting all contributing to making situations that ""kids of all ages "" could ""get"".There is on one level the entire story, of Remy and Linguini, but then there are 3 or 4 or more subplots and a number of dramatic scene changes which almost felt like separate chapters of the main story.

Frozen feels like it could fit right in with the Disney movies of the late 80's/early 90's, like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. The music is great, and I left singing it; the lead characters are very likable, with memorable sidekicks; and there are even surprises, things you would never expect to see in a Disney animated film! This is my favorite movie of the year so far, and may even be my favorite movie in years. I highly recommend this one!",positive,movie
160953,"Of all the visions of the future movie audiences have been treated to over the past few years, the world of Children of Men may be the most frightening and allegorically effective yet.Directed by Alfonso Cauron (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), and set in 2027 London, the film takes place at a time when the planet is in the grip of an infertility crisis. Societies worldwide have collapsed after no children have been born in almost two decades, and the survivors of the ensuing wars, atrocities and civil breakdowns flee to Britain, which still functions under a harsh regime.Clive Owen (Closer, Sin City) plays Theo, a former activist now working as a paper-pusher in the Ministry of Energy and downing a large amount of Scotch to get him through the day. He walks to work past terrorist bombings, cages filled with illegal immigrants rounded up by riot police, and piles of garbage littering the London streets. When an old flame and revolutionary, played by Julianne Moore, appears with a request that he use his governmental connections to help her move a refugee girl across the country, he agrees on the basis he be compensated. When he discovers that the girl (Kee, played by Claire-Hope Ashitey) is pregnant, his mission takes on new dimensions.Cauron and his team of production designers have created what is, perhaps, the most believable vision of the future seen in quite some time. Advanced technology exists side by side with squalor, and is never allowed to steal the audiences attention away from the proceedings for too long. As far as being a realistic portrayal of Britain in twenty years time, the film is light years ahead of last year's disappointing V for Vendetta, which stripped away British iconography and culture and essentially kept London as a rather two-dimensional metaphor for the United States.As a thriller, the film is blisteringly intense and incredibly effective. From the bomb blast that caps off the opening credits to the frenzied urban warfare sequences that dominate the film's closing thirty minutes, Cauron never lets the film lag. Though it slows down enough to deal with character development and exposition, the film maintains a running intensity as Theo and Kee try to stay one step ahead of terrorists, the police, the army and random opportunists. Several action scenes are shot in continuous takes, and make for compelling and electrifying viewing.However, the film works as a socio-political drama as well. Though Cauron's two central messages (that immigrants enrich, rather than threaten, Western society, and that the outlook for human survival is dim when operatives on all sides let ideology displace compassion and good judgment) are strongly put, he is never so heavy-handed that they dominate or displace the actual storyline. Similarly, while the film makes numerous metaphorical references to present-day events, they are never so contrived as to derail the narrative.The film features solid performances from Clive Owen, who is at his rugged, rumpled best, and Julianne Moore. Supporting players also do well: Michael Caine is terrific as Theo's pot-growing hippie friend, the versatile Chiwitel Ejiofor is again in fine form as a revolutionary cell leader, and Pam Ferris is also good as another of Kee's protectors. It is, however, Claire-Hope Ashitey who stands out as the illegal immigrant who may well be humanity's hope for the future.Children of Men is packed with explosive action, incendiary social commentary and some white-hot performances. As a result, it may well be the best film of the year.",positive,movie

What I liked the most about the writing is the character development. Very different characters but they all fit well together to tell that story. It is very easy for the audience to immerse into the story and identify oneself with nearly all of the characters.I also really liked the music that makes you feel time travelling back in time and feel all the moments first hand.To conclude, this is a very elegant and beautiful fairy-tale that is definitely worth watching.

It's about two completely pathetic, dumb, and hopeless guys who do nothing but make complete fools of themselves.

The way that each of them deliver their lines makes this movie an all time classic that will never get old. I never understood how someone could not like this movie. The only explanation I could have is they think they are too ""intelligent"" for a ""dumb movie"" like this. What they don't even understand that it's not the jokes or gags that make this movie so great, it is all in the performances.

161487,"Hitchcock would be proud of this movie.  Even when nothing happens, it is suspenseful.  Director David Lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there, but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse.Altogether surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible.  I am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things I missed and which may help me understand it better.  It is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together, so you must be patient and pay attention.  Get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts.  And yet, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development, and the filming techniques.The dual roles of the main actress, Naomi Watts, showcase her enormous talent.  That is, when I could get my eyes off of her co-star.  What an acting pair.Lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles, the length/timing of editing cuts, jumping back and forth between scenes. Combined with smart use of music and sounds, it all helps to build suspense in our minds, doubtless a major objective of the director.  Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even had me talking to the actors to be careful here, and not be so naive there.  You know, the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies.",positive,movie

161755,"I've seen a lot of movies lately, mostly because we've had a series of amazing releases but Moonlight affected me deeply on a personal level like very few managed to do in the past few years.Having seen the trailer only once and knowing the brilliant cast – Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Janelle Monae – I was sure this one would be a hit. And ten minutes into it I had already gotten a handful of tissues out, like the rest of the audience in the theater and was silently wiping my tears while the actors gave a stellar performance.First of all, I was ecstatic to see that Moonlight featured an all black cast. From behind the camera, to the leads, down to the last extra, kudos and please can we have more already? Second of all, Moonlight showed that a movie can talk about queerness in the black community and turn it into art and present it with dignity and beauty and capture the essence of being a black gay man, the masculinity and actually show the struggles, it went to places a few movies would dare to go and it spoke to me; I know for a fact a lot of people walked out of the cinema more accepting and open-minded. I had a 70-year-old grandpa sitting next to me, weeping and crying like a child, I have never felt more connected with the people I'm randomly watching a movie with.I can't talk about Moonlight enough, the cinematography was exquisite and the directing was epic, the editing just brilliant. I could almost feel the sunlight through the screen and the humidity in the air. The camera takes you with the people and it captures emotion and feelings like you are there, somehow managing to peak into their lives.Despite the fact that the movie goes from decade to decade, childhood, young adult and grown man, you never feel any gaps in the story. Sure through the years there are noticeable differences and happenings we don't know about – and never really get answers to – but this is Chiron's story and unlike books, people don't go about their life everyday talking about the past, or recalling life altering events. We get three major turning points in Chiron's life, presented beautifully and with a painful honesty. The ending left me gasping and a mess, I was happy and full of emotions and love and I still remember scenes from the movie and my heart breaks for Little and at the same time I feel happy for Black and I want to protect Chiron.Moonlight is everything a movie should be and more; an example of how things can and should be portrayed and it all comes with brilliant performances and incredible directing. If there's only one movie you'll watch this year, it's Moonlight. This is why representation matters and why we need more of it. Take everyone with you, recommend it to as many people as you can, never stop talking about it.",positive,movie

Some might say they love it just for the effects; but I believe that it has a great story, and a perfect selection of actors, perfectly cast. Ed Harris excels, as does Tom Hanks - and Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are each superb in their roles.The most wonderful thing about this movie is that it encompasses so many parts and peoples, and appeals to so many, that by the last reel you feel that if they don't make it through, you have lost some of your closest friends.In short: a minor masterpiece.",positive,movie
161887,"Well I finally saw Red Dragon, and having the book be one of the best I've ever read, I was wary of seeing it. I never really cared for Manhunter, but boy did I get a surprise with this version, a version that actually cared enough about the original work to call it by that name, obviously Red Dragon. I also thought that they would change it around to put more of everybody's favorite cannibal in, which they really didn't. So he's in the beginning more, but that was what basically happened in flashback in the book, they only drew it out more in the movie. And the other scenes with Hannibal that were added helped to cover all the ground they needed to do with the story, and they worked perfectly. Let me explain. Who woulda thunk it that Ed Norton would be the perfect fit for Will Graham? I didn't, but he was. I think he's such an incredible actor, and he more than proves it here, bringing the character to a great and realistic life. Of course we need not say anything about Anthony Hopkins, who is more than the brillant fit for Hannibal Lector. But Ralph Fiennes as Dolarhyde? I thought that was a really bad choice-- I was proved wrong there again. He gives such a performance as the Tooth Fairy that I now believe he was perfect, and did perfect in, for the part. Emily Watson as Reba was also incredible, as was all the other supporters. The actual shots of the movie were incredible, and along with the rather brillaint script it worked perfectly. Of course some things were changed, but little things, and not much. And not a single changed thing took away from the original story, I am astounded at how good an adaption this turned out to be. (And I usually am very unforgiving with film versions of great books).  In conclusion, Red Dragon is a great film. Brilliant performances and an excellent adaption of a screenplay play out perfectly in this incredible film. Did the novel it's very deserved justice in my opinion.

I gave this movie a ten because it deserves it everywhere.  The scenes, the sequences, the editing were all great.  Though I'm not involved in the movie industry yet, I try to observe details in a production that make a good, bad, or great movie.  In this case everything fell into place.  The music for certain scenes was perfect.  The characters were extremely believable.  Everyone in the lead and supporting roles deserve an award of some type.  I'm a 49 year old male with two grown kids and two grandchildren but I'm not ashamed to say I was filled with emotion as I watched this film.

161971,"When I was driving to the theater, I was doubting my choice in Seven Psychopaths, because the trailer made it seem like so many films I'd seen before that looked edgy and wry, and showed so much promise in the previews yet fell short because of flat characters and muddled plots. This one, however, did not let me down.I suggest that you see this film purely because it tries to do more with a movie than anything you've seen in a while, and it manages to actually succeeds on all levels, while dangerously romancing the clichés of toying with clichés, movies about writing movies, and gangsters with a soft side. Every time the story started to get even a little generic, wild cards came firing in from all sides.The actors played their parts well, but Rockwell gave the best performance. I was impressed by Woody and Walken's abilities to shed their skins and get deeper into character than I've seen them be in years. This is a writer's film--the subplots (really, borderline vignettes) about the various psychopaths that Marty encounters are well done, their back stories unfold at different paces, and their details that connect them to the central plot are creatively deployed, while the momentum of the film clearly hinges in the here and now and does not make the mistake of merely chaining together several subplots to produce one ""dog"" of a story.I enjoyed almost everything about Seven Psychopaths. 10/10 to offset the 2 that someone without a brain will rate this.",positive,movie

I guess those are similar to the even more awesome Lego movie. They are films that show us that a world of fictional characters can be made into something wonderful. Sadly, this film shows us the complete opposite. I wouldn't quite say it was the worst animated movie I've ever seen. I think that ""honor"" goes to the 2001 animated Titanic movie. This film has credits that go for eight minutes. That other one had credits for fourteen minutes! I guess it technically isn't as ugly as ""Joshua And The Promised Land"", but it really is a worse film. At least that movie was less than an hour long! I hated every minute of this. It has some of the ugliest CGI ever created. These cartoon characters are horrible at showing emotions. They just seem to be staring blankly all the time. All of these characters are ugly. Even the ones who are labeled ugly are really no worse than anyone else. This might be the reason why I'm not into celebrity voices. Of course, anyone would regret being in this movie. What's worse is that there's this guy called General X who explicitly mentions how aroused he is by everything.The villain, Lady X wears clothes that alone should have gotten this movie a PG-13 rating. The climax is one of the most monotonous things I've ever seen in any movie. It's just characters throwing food over and over. It's painfully drawn out for something that's only an hour and a half long. The movements in this film are amazingly terrible. The facial expressions are among the worst ever created. It's good expressions that make me love animation so much. This film makes no sense. It features this world where food mascots go into their own magical world or maybe it comes to life at the end of the day or it exists on some other plane, but I don't care at all.It is a hideous film where the cameos serve no purpose at all. I looked in the credits and I found out there were characters like the Energizer Bunny in this. I didn't recall seeing him so they probably just put him in the crowd scenes for no reason and still mentioned him in the credits. The voices are obnoxious, especially this giant nosed sneezing guy. It's also hateful with them explicitly making Jew jokes. Wait, why would Brand X recall the prunes that Lady X came from? That's impossible!

I was expecting more of the same in AGE OF ICE, a disaster flick in which mankind is threatened by a new ice age, but what I got was one of the worst films imaginable.This is a truly horrible movie and I can't think of a single decent thing to say about it. Gone are the cheesy, over the top effects of the other movies in favour of having a bunch of characters wandering aimlessly through a snowy field. The script was written by somebody with a tin ear, somebody who manages to create a bunch of the most annoying characters and plonk them into the dumbest situations imaginable.Seriously, these are people you'd never want to go on holiday with. The American characters are racist and obnoxious and the foreigners are just there to get wiped out (apart from the 'token' guy, a decent Jordanian). The character of the wife was the most horrible of the lot, I was praying for her death throughout but no such luck. There are no special guest stars here, just a load of badly-acting nobodies. Barton Bund (who he?) is particularly wooden.AGE OF ICE's storyline goes nowhere and none of the action has impact or drama. It's just silliness after silliness. Watch out for the worst car accident I've ever seen on film, involving a guy spinning the camera to simulate a car spinning in the air, oh and two or three CGI cars thrown in for good measure. Godawful indeed and it sums up a worthless viewing experience.",negative,movie
12983,"This is on my 10 all-time bad movie list.Definitely in the Manos: hand of fate pile of hard to watch movies. The sidehacking racing scenes are as boring as the driving scenes in Manos. This movie is terrible and should not be watched unless under the influence of heavy painkillers. Lighthearted scenes of playing in the grass, followed by sleeping pill racing with a sick story of revenge and loss. Very bad combo that does not work. The psycho (JC) does make you hate him though because he is so vile. Avoid unless you have a memory like 50 first dates or Clean Slate.",negative,movie
13157,"I watched Alien Origins with an open mind and low expectations, but I do agree with other commentators that the film was just awful. The poster was cool and the scenery but that's it. In fact, I'd go as far to say that Alien Origins beats Titanic II(Transmorphers was rubbish as well) as the absolute worst film that The Asylum has ever produced. Alien Origins looks cheap, with choppy camera work, some of the worst special effects I've seen for any movie and footage that is clumsily incorporated and adds little if anything to the atmosphere. The aliens look fake and have no menace whatsoever to them. Another big problem was the story. The tone itself is all over the place, you are never sure whether it is trying to be mystery or sci-fi, in both those elements it fails abysmally, never being suspenseful or thrilling enough. It is also lethargic in pace, and never recovers throughout, and there are even times where next to nothing happens. The music and sound effects are generic, with little creepiness, in fact when something does happen they make it all too obvious, which I dislike intensely regarding movies. The dialogue is stilted and aimless, while the characters are stereotypical and have no likability or development to them. The acting is terrible, the actors show no passion or sense of what's going on and all too often it feels as though they were not even directed. All in all, Alien Origins is junk. 1/10 Bethany Cox",negative,movie
13165,"I am a huge fan of bad movies, and over the years I've enjoyed some real stinkers... but this ain't one of them. Even using the word ""boring"" to describe it does an injustice to the definition. The camera work makes me wonder if the cameraman was an intern. The storyline is preposterous and there is never any suspension of disbelief. I fell asleep about midway through but forced myself to go back and watch the parts I missed just to be sure it didn't redeem itself. It never did. It's the entertainment equivalent of Novocaine. While I also didn't care for Blair Witch, that movie was at least original and mildly entertaining. The only thing this movie has going for it is Belize. In fact, if you mute the sound, some of the film looks rather like a travelogue. If they'd stuck with that idea, they might have had something.",negative,movie

Actually, (well to be fair), the plot is not that bad. But...... WHY ARE THE CHARACTERS BEARS?!?!?! I'll answer myself. They are bears because Video BridWANKda wanted to cash in.SIMPLIFIED PLOT PanCOCKa is a bear who wants to be a dancer, but for some reason he works at the dojo that pretty much everyone worships. Some guy is always winning, and the boss wants him out. So he dresses up as a mysterious fighter because for some reason is not allowed to fight even though he owns the dump. But because Pancada sucks at his job, the suit is too small and it looks like him. Cue a 3 minute dance scene, (yes) a huge montage scene, and Pancada fights the guy and loses. The owner (who suspiciously looks like Ice Bears drunk deformed cousin) knew Pancada wouldn't win and tripled the bets on the other guy.

The whole thing seems like someone said hey lets break out the camcorders and make a movie this weekend, came up with a good title and a workable story idea and then just stopped thinking at that point.

The movie was AWFUL. you hardly laugh during the movie, it has an amateur script, lots of mistakes unprofessional actors and most of the time you were watching flashbacks of the 80s series.another point i really didn't like was that this movie was used by sponsors of the movie, an online casino and a telephone enquiries company in Greece, to advertise their products, it was so obvious in several parts of the movie but especially when the lyceum owner sits and comments how good the online casino is, says the website, and mentions you can play from home, at your own comfort etc, why that was there what was the need?also in many times there was dub (when you talk over the movie which was asynchronous with the play)Script wise, Directors wise, was a disaster its a pity that the production company, the directors and script writers did not exploited the opportunity and the success of the movie in the 80s to make a great comedy like the 80s oneswhy was that movie released? a great opportunity was missed.

14351,"I hate to admit this, but I used to be a big fan of the Nostalgia Critic. Aside from the later Roger Ebert or Chris Stuckmann, Doug was one of my favorite movie reviewers. Then he ended the series to make Demo Reel, a pile of trash. As the Critic was the one that was providing traffic for Channel Awesome, Doug resurrected the Critic, and his videos...varied in quality. Of note was when he introduced other actors to make skits in his reviews. The skits were okay at best, padding out the video span at worst.Then there was 2018 when the infamous Not So Awesome document was dropped revealing how Doug and the others poorly managed the anniversary specials by either denying cast members food or water, or firing those who failed to meet up on a Skype chat in their intended time. Worse, they covered for a sex offender whom they also threw memorial videos to when said offender committed suicide back in 2014. Suffice to say, several contributors left the site, and the site had since made poor apologies, or called the people mentioned in the document liars.But that's all besides the point. Doug's worst review to me is unquestionably his review of the 1982 film Pink Floyd's The Wall based on the album of the same name. The Critic doesn't even bother to research the history behind the album such as by not realizing just how bad schooling was in Great Britain, and instead concludes that Pink was a whiny little rocker and compares the American school system to Great Britain's. The film delves into many of Pink Floyd's personal demons, which anyone would recognize with a minimum amount of research. Something that Doug Walker -- a movie critic -- seemingly forgot to do.Nothing beneficial happens in the review which was forty hours long (and he had the gall to poke fun at the movie's runtime). Worse, that shows that the Critic didn't even try to make the animation amazing instead opting for MS Paint (like that bird representing ""ego""). While he goes out of his way to call his review and album a ""love letter,"" a majority of the lyrics blatantly take jabs at Floyd's songs to the point that it comes off as an insult. I know that he also hired another YouTuber to create CGI beasts. The problem is that the fantastical elements in the original film were there to symbolize events in Floyd's life. These CGI monstrosities have nothing to do with Doug in particular, and it would've made more sense if Doug instead used his own recurring characters.And after 40 minutes of pointlessness, what does the Critic say to sum up his feelings of the movie? He said that it , while pretentious, was okay. Why did it need to take 40 minutes if you were just going to sum your opinion up as that? And how can we really know that it's what he seriously believed since he took several instances to take jabs at Floyd's music?Overall, an incredibly bad review that misses the point and was largely unfunny.",negative,movie

14810,"""Kidz Rule,"" or ""Seamless"" as it was packaged at Video Hits Plus in Kalamazoo, is a horrible movie.  The tragedy is that Shannon Elizabeth (of American Pie infamy) is the best actor in the cast.  The protagonist, J.B. (Kentaro Seagal) reads lines like that kid behind you in High School who clearly hadn't made it past the 3rd grade reading level before Junior High. Not that he doesn't get everything one of those guys would have wanted in a throw-away love scene with Miss Elizabeth.However, there is no nudity in this movie, and that really doesn't help the situation.  With a movie like this, I'm surprised the director didn't ask for more skin when he realized what he was working with.  There's plenty of sexuality without nudity, though - including one anxiety-ridden, stressed-out teenager who ends up trading sex for money.One more thing I should mention is the character of Elmo, played by Broc Benedict.  Truly heartbreaking in his over-acting, Broc is probably the most proficient actor after Shannon Elizabeth.  If you think you've seen him before, you may have - he played the younger version of Eric Foreman in flashbacks on ""That 70s Show.""I gave this a 2 out of 10.  If you and your friends go to the video store and you see this on the shelf, you see Shannon Elizabeth staring at you with those ""undress me"" eyes, remember this review and put the movie back down.

After watching Spacy Mutiny (which I could tell was going to be a Star Wars rip-off just from the title, never mind that the ""sexy"" main characters names were Ryder and Lea) I told my wife that as far as compared to that ridiculous movie, Overdrawn at the Memory Bank was smart, thought-inspiring, and heartfelt. **I HATED SPACE MUTINY**!

People did this work for Space Mutiny, and none of it made this movie more interesting than a movie about a steaming turd.

I also was impressed by some of the stunt men, who threw themselves off of extremely high railings in interesting positions; too bad the particular fight they perished in (appently the climax of the movie) was horribly staged, the music was insipid keyboard noises, the main characters were in plain view and consistently shot at and missed from mere feet away. . .

As I've always said, a leopard cant change their spots, and a crap actor can't either.Anthony Cardoza: Helped to direct and produce this mess. Another survivor from Skydivers. (Must have landed flat!) Coleman Francis: Like Anthony Cardoza, survived Skydivers and directed this and played embarrassingly badly.So what do we do with this cast of crapness? Put them in a story so unbelievably weak that it wall fall if stretched under a paperweight bridge! Coleman Francis and his merry men decide to invade Cuba with a whopping army of...*puff*...*pant* SEVEN soldiers, and end up getting captured. Believablilty? Quality Control? What's that Daddy?Regrettably the three main characters later escape and go out on a random killing spree for no reason at all (is this how the happy slap started) until thank heavens, Coleman is shot through the head, the only watchable part of the movie. And as for the lighting, soundtrack and editing of this whole debacle? Well I'm a man of few words, but the only words I can use to describe this department are unrepeatable.If you are going to watch this film then make sure, on the peril of death, that you watch it with either MST3K present, or if you are drunk with a crowd of pals. And then afterwards, discard it and smash it to pieces with a sledgehammer. Oh and burn it just to be safe.Don't watch this film.",negative,movie
16246,"Alright, this movie is bad. B, A, D! Bad! I had an expectation that it would not be a super great movie, being a SyFy movie and all, but wow! This was beyond anything I had imagined or could imagine.First of all, they kept showing the same scenes over and over and over and over and over... And those scenes were not even nice to look at. Already here the movie was starting to go downhill.The effects in the movie were laughable at best. There weren't a single moment in the movie that were above mediocre.As for the acting, well it was strained and hard to digest. But at least they gave it a shot! This movie is good for one thing only, and that is cheap laughs. I am going to make my friends watch it, because it cannot be put into words how bad this movie really is.""Mega Piranha"" is a movie that should be avoided if you are a movie-lover.

I'm thinking the tooth found in the underwater cable belongs to one of them , Lord knows they have enough to spare!!!The acting in this mess of a movie is so appalling; I kept expecting there to be a lot more gratuitous nudity and sex scenes, although I've seen pornography with more talent in it. And what's with the grunting and groaning from the shark? Maybe it read the script and was trying to communicate with it's agent! I'd sue!Meanwhile, if this is the 3rd in the series, I don't think I want to see the other 2 .... it would be very hard to match the standard of this film.I'm going to pop down to the DVD store and ask for my 90 minutes and $1.95 back ...

16455,"Joe Don Baker plays a police detective with an affinity for booze and blondes and not much else. His life is miserable. One finds oneself wondering why anyone would want to tell the story of someone so unhappy and why we the audience are spending 90 minutes of our lives being exposed to his misery. Despite his lack of personal morals in his own life, and his inability to engender anything more than disdain from his fellow coworkers, somehow Baker has acquired a near zero-tolerance for any criminal behavior among other people. He's simultaneously amoral and noble, and we the audience are left wondering why, because the script never manages to explain it for us. There's very little to love about Mitchell, but Baker manages to muddle through the script nonetheless; not an easy job for any actor. Baker should have received an award for tolerating the terribly written script that was given him. The film is more like a failed pilot for television than an actual silver screen cop action movie. The plot is difficult to describe without the use of censorable and colorful adjectives. There appears to be at least two different plots going at the same time, and the plot with John Saxton in it starts the film but then peters out about halfway through. The other plot involves Baker sitting outside a rich guy's house because he's somehow involved in drug smuggling, and eventually finding himself being beat up and shot at. He's even accosted verbally by a young child on a skateboard. Attempts at humor abound, but nothing seems to really engender a good laugh. Linda Evans uneventfully plays a prostitute who is hired to make love with Mitchell, and for some strange reason falls in love with him despite the audience's inability to comprehend why. Mitchell features what is perhaps the slowest car chase in the history of cinema, and that alone is worth watching the film for true action flick fans, if nothing more than to see what film makers should never do. Mitchell acquired a renewal of sorts in the form of Mystery Science Theater 3000 in the mid-90s, when the film was featured as the form of torture used by mad scientists on an innocent Joel Robinson and his lovable robots. This particular episode of MST3K is the turning point of that series, because it's the one where Joel Hodgson left the series and was replaced by head writer Mike Nelson. So all fans of MST3K hold a special place in their hearts for this, the worst cop flick ever.",negative,movie

16484,"When you see a blonde woman threaten an old coot dressed up as Merlin, with Mace, you know you're in for a treat of a movie. Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders is one of the most muddled up, confused, poorly stitched together films you could ever have the misfortune to come across. It opens with a young boy watching TV. His grandfather then begins to tell him some stories about Merlin, the Great Magician, who has opened up a spell shop in the modern times. Selling potions, spell books, snakes, spiders, cauldrons and other wacky products, it's no surprise that an enraged reviewer decides to threaten Merlin by promising to give an awful review in the local paper about the shop. He then takes one of Merlin's spell books home and begins to dabble in the dark arts, only managing to turn his cat into a vicious beast. The cat then begins to violently attack it's owner, which results in the man setting the cat alight, and letting it die in a burst of flames. So far so good for a children's movie? No. So far so good for a horror film? No. Okay then... well, so far so good? No! The pain then continues when the man continues to practise spells, but only ends up turning himself a hundred years older, then turning himself back in time, to a young baby. And there, we have the end of the first strange story. Nothing very entertaining to get out of it. It's to harsh and bloody for young viewers, yet to unrealistic, unappealing and tame for any older viewer. The acting so far stinks like rotting fish, and the plot is a muddled as you can get. Then onto the second story, about a birthday present bought for a kid; a procession monkey doll, which claps cymbals and chatters it's teeth. However whenever it does this, something bad happens (starting with a goldfish, then the cat, then the near miss with the human) This episode is a fun premise, but is done slowly and painfully, with no real suspense or excitement to hold you down and reel you in. It's just to boring and slow and plain for anyone over ten years watching, and to creepy and a slight bit unsettling for very young, young children. So what audience category does this fit into? Who will enjoy it? Who is it aimed at? The answer is; no-one. And no-one should feel the need to torture themselves by trying to sit through this bland, sordid mess.",negative,movie

16815,"As putrid a piece of slop ever released, this Edgewood Entertainment crapper (aslo known as ""Time Chasers"") was filmed entirely in the state of Vermont, the least-visited and cared-about of all 50, and tells the ridiculous tale of Nick Miller (Matthew Bruch-one of the single ugliest leading men in cinematic history, in fact, he makes Rowsdower from ""The Final Sacrifice,"" look like Brad Pitt), who invents a time-traveling device that is powered by a Wang computer and a Piper Cub.He jumps (or flies) ahead to 2041, sees some ""futuristic"" stuff, then comes back and sells the invention to a huge corporation. Later, after a lame trip to the ""1950s,"" he goes back to the future, where a cheap matte painting shows that a war took place and the (unnamed) city is in ruins.He fights off a bunch of rejects from 2041, comes back to the present, hijacks his own plane, crashes it and kills his girlfriend, Lisa (Bonnie Pritchard), and then travels to the Revolutionary War, where he dies, but his double and his girlfriend's doppelganger are still alive, so they go back to the present just before he was to sell the invention, and stops himself from doing it.Wow. Not only confusing, but boring and ridiculous (although it's a much better time-travel film than ""The Lake House"").Here are some more specific ""highlights"" of just how amazingly bad this movie is: During a chase scene where Nick is trying to escape on a ten-speed bicycle, the bad guys actually get out of a truck they were in and pursue him - on BIKES.Scenes in the future depict ""actors"" walking around in loud, garish, baggy clothing and talking on cell phones, much like they do today. There is also a sign that reads, ""This building is constructed of recycled material, 2021."" The voyage to the 1950s shows a few classic cars and a malt shop. The bad guys were not counting on being outwitted by an airport hangar custodian.As bad as the two leads are, the corporate clowns (Peter Harrington and George Woodard-J.K. Robertson) are just plain awful. The Revolutionary War scenes are included for no other reason than to show off a bunch of fat re-en-actors, and during these sequences, the single dumbest lines ever written for a ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" episode is uttered: Speaking of some fleeing American colonists, running from machine gun fire, Nick says, ""I don't think they've ever seen an Uzi before."" Duh! No kidding. Terrible from every vantage point, the movie is nonetheless perfect fodder for the satirical minds at ""MST3K,"" if nothing else.",negative,movie
16924,"While I didn't think much at all of 2-Headed Shark Attack, this was worse. The former at least tried to be fun (although the cheapness and ineptitude of it all got in the way) and had one cast member who tried, but 3-Headed Shark Attack takes itself too seriously, as well as being so stupid and being unoriginal in doing so, with next to nothing that makes it stand out from other shark movies (apart from with the shark) and wastes the talent it has.3-Headed Shark Attack is by far the worst looking of the SyFy shark movies aired this year. Any nice scenery that the movie has is difficult to appreciate when the movie is shot in such a drab way and when it's edited so amateurishly that bacon-slicer-like editing looks more refined. Worst of all in this regard are the effects, as it was made on low-budget it would have been forgiven a little if it was not great, but when the effects for the shark look as if no effort was given in making them without looking so goofy and unfinished-looking that is hard to ignore, the only thing that it has that's superior for that of 2-Headed Shark Attack is that the size is more consistent. So is the shark's lack of presence or personality, it's not menacing, it's not scary and it's not fun, it's not even strong enough to bring any unintentional humour or goofiness, that's how bland it is. Music is very generic and adds very little, it's not always appropriate either.The movie's writing ranges between incredibly bad to appalling, with the exception of two dark comedy moments with the head inside the shark and the boy riding the shark as if skiing, and they only raised a mild chuckle and like they were lifted right out of other shark movies (the latter being a little like in Sharknado 2). Any comedy is incredibly forced and is so cheesy it is enough to make the eyes roll in disbelief, while the more serious moments are very awkwardly written and as trite as anybody can possibly go. The attacks are far too rushed, lack any kind of suspense and the over-silliness to the point of intelligence-insulting stupidity, terrible shark effects, bad editing and even more gratuitous gore further cheapen them. To describe the story as weak is being too insulting to the word weak, it is a very lethargically paced and thin as ice story with lots of padding that is either badly written or serves no point at all to the movie, other than attempts at novelty value, which falls flat on its face because it all feels so tired. It is not fun, it is not scary and it is not thrilling or suspenseful, it's just nothing but tired stupidity.As for the characters, that they're tired clichés isn't so much a problem, the problem is that they are either obnoxious with them constantly doing stupid things, so bland that it makes zombies seem more animated or both. Some of them are superfluous to the story or come and go out of nowhere constantly. The direction is as flat as a pancake, and the acting is awful with the unforgivable waste of Danny Trejo being one of the movie's biggest offences. Trejo, no matter how hard he tries, has nothing to work with with none of his material playing to his strengths as a performer, and he over-compensates as a result, for someone like Trejo who has a knack for raising a lot of bad movies up a notch it's shameful. Everybody else either overacts painfully or are amateurishly bland.In summary, despite the small bit of originality with the shark 3-Headed Shark Attack is a dreadful movie all round and near-indefensible. 1/10 Bethany Cox",negative,movie

The episode was also SwaySway wanting Jenny Quackles to eat the Love Loaf so she'll fall in love with him, and then they will get married and have little baby ducklings and live happily quackily ever after. So he's FORCING someone to love him out of his own selfish desires. That's not the worst of it.

I have a few observations to offer.This movie certainly falls within the realm of ""there go eighty minutes of my life that I'll never get back again"". In fact I have two quite earnest theories about this movie that may account for at least a part of its overall horribility.It is quite obvious that the film was only minimally scripted. There were all the hallmarks of improvised dialog, but not in an artsy experimental cinema kind of way. More like ""OK, We've got this sound stage for an hour, but no dialog written. Action!"" My other suspicion is that the studio contracted for a film of a specific length, and the director was actively trying to pad it out. This is quite obvious. Another commenter mentioned product placements for Longines watches, but not every time we were subjected to real-time half-minute closeups of clocks were we looking at a Longines.Finally, If I ever hear Borodin's ""Stranger in Paradise"" again, I'll strangle myself!

This movie is an exercise in slow moving shots, no script, close-ups, terrible edited, and a poorly developed plot.

It is hard to comprehend why a movie focused on the future, made in 2014, would showcase technology that was outdated by nearly a decade by the time the film was made. I followed it through to the end hoping it would improve. It didn't. There were only three women in the film. All were objectified and were victims of violent assault.

This was so, so disrespectful to Aaliya's legacy, and I'm just hoping and praying that Missy and Timbaland, whenever they feel they want to, will do this movie justice the way it is supposed to be done. The fact that they weren't even apart of this production, and the parents even said no to the production, why would you even waste your time writing and producing this garbage!?

Don't tell it based on an unauthorized book and Wikpedia. The actors didn't even come close to matching the original people, and even though Ship was only the slightest exception, she did not do Aaliyah justice at all. It didn't seem like she even studied on how Aaliyah, spoke, how she moved or anything. The timeline of the story was even off, and most of the movie felt rushed. I feel really bad for those actors. They will never be able to live this one down because of someone's poor decision of greed and a buck. I'm just so upset.

A movie so utterly terrible that even Michael Bay would cringe at the mere sight of it. I am, of course, talking about A Talking Cat!?! By David DeCoteau.Yes, I did not add those punctuation marks. The legitimate title of this movie is: A Talking Cat!?! It seems even the film itself is confused to how anybody allowed it to be produced. This movie was created in 2013. Unsurprisingly, it was a Direct-To- DVD release. That means that this abomination was not shown off in theaters, which is a relief, as the poor children who watched it would have had their eyeballs burned to oblivion.The only redeemable quality in this film is how laughably bad it is. It makes for good entertainment if you just want to lie around, feel like absolute garbage, and riff a children's movie about a talking cat who speaks with his lips MS- Painted on. No, really, that's how the beast talks. His mouth is digitally painted black to represent an open mouth, but instead resembles an unending void of chaos and despair, hoping to leech away at this mortal coil.Before we discuss the plot, let's talk about production. This movie had a budget of one-million dollars. One. Million. Dollars. I can only assume that a hundred bucks went into the actual movie, and the rest of the money went into all the crazy drugs they used while creating this flick. You know what else had a budget of one million dollars? Rocky. Rocky was a pretty good film. That proves that it was not the budget that decided the quality of this movie. The reason A Talking Cat!?! is so bad is because Mr. DeCoteau was probably too busy tripping to be worried about, oh, I don't know, how good his film is!But I digress. The film revolves around a.wait for it.talking cat. What a shock. He is voiced by Eric Roberts. Do you know who that is? Neither do I. The gruff-voice for the tiny cat is pretty surprising, but even more surprising then that is that Roberts spent 15 minutes recording dialogue for this film in his living room. Only 15 minutes. For a professional voice actor, and the main character, that is not enough time.The cat protagonist, named Duffy, is a magical talking cat. Okay. I can believe that. But what I can't believe is that this talking is limited so that he can only speak to a person once, and just once. What kind of a lame power is that? If you're only going to have one line for each character in the movie (note: 6 characters in the movie) then why call this movie A Talking Cat!?! if said talking cat barely even talks?We get to see how the cat helps people with their problems. Specifically, a father named Phil, played by Johnny Whitaker, who is like if that one scientist from Jurassic Park became twice as eccentric and three times as obnoxious. Who are the other characters, you ask? Who cares? They barely deserve any recognition. I looked up the four other actors, and it says a lot that their most prominent work is A Talking Cat!?! This movie is like a plague. If you are in any way involved in it, you've dug your own grave.Let's get into the conflict of the movie. Phil's son, WhatsHisFace, is mean to his father. Why? I don't even know. The father, even though he decorates the inside of his house with trees and weird statues, doesn't seem like a bad guy. So why's the son hostile to him? To drive the plot. That's all this movie is. An awful talking cat and a bunch of things that only exist to drive the plot. The rest of the story is just nonsense. Half of it's not even story. At least a third of the movie are establishing shots of forests and characters slowly walking up stairs or empty hallways. This movie makes me physically ill to watch. It's almost as if somebody crafted this piece just to torture me for all of eternity. If you get to buy one DVD this year, don't buy A Talking Cat!?! Wait, no. Better idea. Buy the DVD and then burn it. Burn it to the ground. The satisfaction that you will get from destroying this film will be worth the money.",negative,movie

La Jolla or some place in Orange county would be much more desirable!)These varmints are impervious to bullets as they are self sealing.

The real awfulness that sets this one apart is the music. It is indescribable. The songs turn up, for no apparent reason, about every five minutes and they are atrocious. They have lyrics like ""I breathe every breath for me!"" I'm glad the kid understands the physiology of breathing, but does he have to sing about it? It's hard to comment on the score because the teenagers are absolutely unable to play any musical instrument (except for the blind kid whose electric bass works just fine in the forest, as if by magic)and are even less able to carry a tune. I would think that a random sample of kids off the street would contain at least one who could carry a tune. Not this sample!

If they was made on a Commodore 64 back in 1982 it would be amazing, today really not so amazing.IMDb claims that the budget was AUD 50.000 (less than 40000 USD), if thats correct then the movie really are amazing and I would have to give it atleast 5 thumbs up.

While the first The Last Exorcism did the part quite well, in making me sense the dread and the horror, the sequel is an abomination of horror genre. No effects, no creepy atmosphere, no jump-out-of-your-skin moments, a lot of gaps and mistakes, nonsense throughout the movie. It took me two nights to finish it. The first night I sat there bewildered of what was happening on screen and thought ""Am I actually seeing this? Were they serious when they made this?"" and I had to close it and chose something else. And because I never leave a film unfinished, especially when I'm the one who picked it, two nights later, here I was, on my post, trying to get some meaning and purpose to this ridiculous sequel. Even the title is nonsense. They should've called the first one The Last Exorcism Part I but they weren't prepared for a continuation and when it got 100 million in the box office, they decided to just do it, since they've already gotten the cow. And I'm thinking their decision went like this: ""Hey, everybody is doing a sequel, let's do one too, right?. Think of how much money we could make? We'll call it The Last Exorcism II No, wait, that's an oxymoron, we'll call it The Last Exorcism Part II, implying that the first was part one of a series. Think about it. They love sequels after sequels after sequels."". Oxymoron or no oxymoron, they're still morons. The entire movie is nonsense. Whenever I thought that something was going to happen, which I believed it would've made sense and would've been logical, the entire plot takes a drastic turn. I bet when they wrote the script, they thought the audience could guess a possible outcome to a particular situation, so they changed the outcome radically. Now, I always applaud unpredictability. I like the shock that I'm not always right when it comes to a character or a story. I like to be surprised and I appreciate the mind games. But in The Last Exorcism Part II, the script was an utter absurdity. The demon was hilarious. Seriously, it felt like a parody of Little Nicky (which is kind of a parody on its own). And the girl, Nell, was incredibly stupid and annoying. I was offended on behalf of Supernatural. I know the practice of salt as a protection against an evil spirit/demon isn't originated from the depths of the Supernatural writers's minds. Not even the black eyed demons. But Supernatural is the only show that uses these two elements at the same time. And guess what, now crappy sequels use them too.

Those in the theater with me wanted to be there and damn all those who, like myself, would snap-judge Madea and her posse of octogenarian clowns. Screw those who poo-poo the series for being painfully unfunny, offensively trashy, unendingly annoying, obnoxiously time consuming, woefully amateurish and elementally lacking in the basic necessities of competent storytelling. For even if you think all these things, you still must admit, if nothing else, Tyler Perry's wildly successful, cheaply made, broadly drawn comedy series has legs that just won't quit.So for a change, I'll dispense with the usual five minute set. I won't complain about how unfunny this particular film is as claiming so can be waived off by someone else managing a slight chuckle. I won't complain about the disjointed, obvious and boooooring narrative which chugs along like Madea's Cadillac on a flat tire. Heck, I won't even talk about how every time a Madea flick comes out, seeing the crowd makes me question human behavior to the extent that I feel like the proverbial next door neighbor saying, ""He was so very nice – no idea what could have gone wrong."" Instead I'd like to focus all my attention (and vitriol) on Tyler Perry's apparent lack of respect for his audience; a lack of respect that, more than ever feels gross and mean-spirited. Before watching Boo 2, I ascribed to the same school of thought as Demetria Lucas D'Oyley when she wrote for The Root, ""He has a lane. He drives in it."" The appeal of his characters and his outsized media persona is one of broad stroke buffoonery and simple-world proselytizing but at least he's found his fans and they've found him. Marriage made in heaven with the same level of intensity as Insane Clown Posse and their Juggolos.Yet by the time the film drops its first plot point, it becomes clear the love is all one-sided. Nearly everything of substance from the first film has been erased; the lessons, the character dynamics, the film's very continuity all heavily favoring a hard reboot where nothing about Boo 1! (2016) actually mattered. The movie then strips out all of the forced religiosity save for a few God d**ns which, for better or worse, made Madea part of a certain audiences' normal media diet.Lacking a plot at all capable of filling in the one and a half hour run time and all that's left to pad this largely melted s**t sundae is Perry mugging for the camera as one of three insufferable characters. This wouldn't be such a problem for fans accustomed to the constant barrage of b***hing and nagging. But most of what is said are quite literally rewrites of the same tired jokes we've heard in Witness Protection (2012), Big Happy Family (2011) and for that matter, the first Boo! There's even the reoccurring ""she's really a dude"" gag that's repeated not once, not twice but three bloody times! I'd say it's lazy but given how absurdly repetitive this all is, I was half expecting Sacha Baron Cohen to come popping out of that dress saying, ""gotcha!"" All this and add to it Perry's obviously censored d**ns, f**ks and s**ts and you got yourself a movie that is daring longtime fans to abandon Perry's media empire built on lazy, terrible stereotypes. And what's left when all that bilious smoke has cleared? A quickie cash grab haphazardly assembled with no interest in delivering the minimum, let alone a worthwhile product. Comparatively this thing is somewhere between Madea Goes to Jail (2009) and one of Tyler Perry's bowel movements after one too many Arby's Beef 'N Cheddars.

24362,"I went to the release of this movie in LA and right before the film they ironically had a fund raiser for some kind of ""green peace"" animal adoption scam. They depicted poor and neglected puppies and promised to save these helpless animals with the audiences support. The so called volunteers went through the theater to each person asking for a donation by saying that the movie wasn't free, and a twenty dollar minimum donation would be acceptable. As the movie began the ""charity"" group disappeared with thousand of dollars from the packed theater. Kevin Gage is an excellent actor but everything about the movie is udder c**p, too much graphic rape and murder that was nonconstructive to a plot; terrible editing and directing. This movie is possibly the worst movie ever made. A sadist would rate ""Barny and friends"" better.",negative,movie
24393,"I just went to see this at the cinema. It was like watching a really shitty pantomime with decent actors. I felt like crying for all the wrong reasons. I swear if there's anything Matt Lucas, Simon Bird, Jonny Vegas or all the other actors starring in this trashy crap will ever regret in their careers, it will definitely be this. There were occasional moments of adult (well at least supposed to be) humour that just wasn't funny. To be fair, it was the only thing that I could watch at my frankly crappy cinema at the time I wanted. I could've left halfway through it was so bad. It was also poorly directed and the set wasn't particularly good. The only thing I've ever sat and watched worse than that film was either a pantomime or paint dry. I know it's for kids but seriously? It was so immature, I reckon a baby in a cot wouldn't even giggle at it. Also, after about 15 minutes of crappy humour the cast just end up looking lost on set, any so-called 'jokes' wouldn't be funny in the slightest outside of the UK and the musical numbers were about as funny as watching a stone.

24528,"""A Christmas Story 2"" (2012), dead ""movie"" walking! Why does this ""film"" exist? Just, why?! This is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the worst Christmas movies of all-time. Lazy and cliched story, horrible acting, terrible sets/locations, cheap special effects, and a boring soundtrack. The story is essentially just a carbon copy of the original movie. It's like they took the script, changed the plot line slightly, and barely altered the situations. The Red Ryder BB gun was replaced by a car, they rip off the sticky tongue scene, etc. The acting in this ""film"" is some of the worst I've seen. I've honestly seen better acting in a preschool play! But, Braeden Lemasters, the actor who plays Ralphie in this ""movie"" does a fairly decent job. He took the character to a unique level, made it his own, and sort of expressed what we imagine a teenage Ralphie would be like. The rest of the actors in this ""film"" are absolutely awful, even Daniel Stern, which really shocked me! He took the place of late actor Darren McGavin (R.I.P.), who played the father in the original film. Daniel Stern's involvement in the cast was one of the reasons why I decided to watch this ""movie"" in the first place. But sadly, he couldn't save this ""movie"". What little there is! However, this isn't the first time Daniel Stern was subjected to being in a horrible movie. *Cough*, ""Diner"" (1982), *cough*. Even the narrator does a lousy job! It almost sounds like a nervous Adam West impression. Seriously, it's like the person narrating was forced to do it by having a gun pressed into his back. Every time he speaks, it sounds like he's on edge! The sets/locations are abysmal. You can tell that the backgrounds are CGI, and it's painfully obvious that the interior sets are filmed in a studio. The special effects are a joke! For a ""movie"" made in 2012 that is very surprising. I do have to give some credit to the editor(s) by adding a sepia tone filter to the ""movie"" to give it that old fashioned look like in the first movie. But even that was taken too far! It looks like someone snagged the film reels and peed on them. It looks like this ""movie"" was filmed in a jar of pee! As for the rest of the special effects, they're just cheap and generic. The soundtrack is boring, and is not memorable at all. I couldn't remember a single note from any point of the score, except for the opening theme. Just hearing that opening theme served as a warning to what you were getting into with this ""film""! This is definitely one of the worst live-action Christmas movies ever made. It makes me cringe just thinking about it! I give this ""movie"" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 0 out of 10 stars. Ignore the 1 star on IMDB, I can't rate any lower than that. My rating overall is 0! Here's some advice for you: if you have naughty children and you can't find coal, just give them a copy of this ""movie"" on DVD. Even that's still kind of harsh! Bottom line, don't watch this ""movie"", just stick with the original movie ""A Christmas Story"" (1983) instead. All ""A Christmas Story 2"" does is make you ask: ""why am I watching this movie? Why am I not watching the original movie?""",negative,movie

And why would alien life target this one man and leave so much evidence when the rest of us search and search and never really find anything? This fake documentary starts off without explaining much, just showing a bunch of UFO clips and sightings, etc. I didn't think it was too ridiculous until I saw the clip of the ""alien""looking at him through his window and his reaction to it.

But this one is just a plain teenage slashing movie, and just so that you won't think that my appreciation of the movie is due to my general taste in movies, I can tell you that compared to any ""I know what you did last Summer"", or ""Halloween"", or such, those movies are works of pure cinematic art compared to ""Cruel World"". I'm sorry if I'm not being very clear about why I didn't like it, but I wouldn't know where to start: could it be because there is not a drop of originality whatever? No plot?

26712,"OK, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would do it shot for shot? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful. First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. Where's originality? Why remake a movie that is almost perfect EXACTLY the way it was done the first time? Why remake such a movie to begin with? If you ARE going to remake something, remake something that doesn't work and make it BETTER!Second, they used the exact same script from the 1960 version. The dialog no longer works. It works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch didn't write the script, you could have rewritten. This film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing John Anderson's performance as the car salesman in the original. All the actors seemed like the only direction they were given was be the characters from the original movie. Vince Vaughn may have seemed a little creepier than Anthony Perkins, but in doing so, you loose the sympathy you are supposed to have for Norman. Having Norman masturbate while watching Marion undress was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was far too old to play Caroline. Her lines came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun like Patricia Hitchcock's performance. The only good thing I saw about the film was that Gus Van Sant was able to open the movie with the shot Hitch had envisioned. Hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot going over Phoenix but couldn't at the time so he had to settle for a series of shots cross-dissolved together. This film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel. After that, though the film became a worthless waste of celluloid. If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film, watch this, but do NOT under any circumstances watch this BEFORE you watch the original.

27874,"There are worse Shark movies out there, but that doesn't stop Shark in Venice from being really bad. The only halfway decent things are some nice scenery and the music, a little over-dramatic at times but it did at least try and give some life and pace. It's a shame that we can't appreciate the scenery more because the camera work is so haphazard, the stock footage is over-used and over-obvious and the editing is very repetitive(like we often see the same shot or same thing happening within minutes of each other) and some of the worst personally seen recently. And the less said about the special effects for the shark the better, it was pretty much over-sized rubber and not much else. The shark has no menace or personality and is so under-utilised that you could swear it was a shark movie but without the shark at times. The dialogue is so stilted and cornball that it was difficult trying to stifle any laughter, even stifling a coughing fit I had two days ago during a recital was less painful. It barely made sense either, while the story takes ridiculous to extremes with science and history completely re-written, scenes that repeat themselves more than once in a short space of time(like the editing), no suspense, thrills, fun or tension and scenes like the ability to talk underwater without lips moving and covered in diving equipment that is insultingly stupid beyond belief. The attacks are completely dull in mood and so stock in a way that you can barely see anything, and the only thing you learn about the characters is what kind of stereotype they are, other than that they're painfully underdeveloped and are not relatable in the slightest. The acting is pretty atrocious with the best acting coming from (no joke) Stephen Baldwin's moobs, okay the main antagonist certainly looked the part but the over-compensated acting was a different story and everyone else especially Baldwin(who ironically has much more screen time than the shark) goes through the motions. To conclude, even when taking it for what it is Shark in Venice is terrible as a shark movie and a movie in general. 2/10 Bethany Cox",negative,movie
27921,"This movie was made with one purpose: to trick people into buying the DVD/blue-ray of ""Jack the giant killer"", only to be disappointed it isn't the blockbuster movie ""Jack the giant slayer"" they thought it was. There cannot have been any other reason or intention for making it because this movie is the very worst of utter crap. It really is just the stolen movie title filled with garbage. However, there is a story in there. It has actors, it has special effects, though extremely bad, appalling, awful. The movie has inconsistency written all over it. Nothing makes any sense, at all. The script, the acting, props, action scenes, - nothing measures up to any standard other than making a buck from stealing the title from a blockbuster by just throwing something together badly without much of a budget. The dinosaur cgi was half decent though. I cannot blame the actors for bad acting, when probably everything was shot in one take. There simply may have been no time or budget to re-do anything. Perhaps the actors were also lured into this sham, ignorant of it's true nature. There should be laws against this shameless deceit. On the other hand, some bad movies - because they were done badly, either for the lack of skill or on purpose - gain a cult status. This one will not. Just to describe some major issues: Jack, an ordinary kid, is building/finishing some sort of battle robot as in ""Avatar"". The feet of the thing are shown several times walking on grass, in the opening scene. Clearly, it is just a couple of cardboard boxes with some spray paint. And he's building this thing for what reason? And with what means? No matter, he's got it working right in the nick of time, to kill the giant dinosaur in the end scene. Another delight is the flying castle. The ""engine room"" is nothing but an old smith's forge with forging tools hanging on the wall. The beans don't add up. Jack receives two beans. Which he throws away into a field (and grow into a beanstalk). Later, his stepsister finds another bean in Jack's jacket, and plants that one. At the very end of the movie, Jack manages to find another one of those beans in his pocket. Even if he threw away only one bean and inconsistently put the other in his pocket, still one extra bean has magically appeared somehow.As mentioned in the other reviews, the time setting is inconsistent - old cameras and modern helicopters. Well the list is really endless. My conclusion is, that if you have ocd and enjoy counting goof-ups, you might like this movie a lot. Also it might be fun, to try to explain all the apparent inconsistencies.",negative,movie

The big one is the same CGI model but scaled up.The acting / dialogue is stilted and funny. It has a delightful amateur- dramatics quality to it. And the guy playing the general is hamming it up to Monty Python standards. Nothing about this is remotely believable but as another reviewer noted, the floaty castle is quite nice. Though powered by a fire that looked barely strong enough to toast marshmallows on. The CGI - is very bad, very 90s. Probably someone with a copy of some 3D software offered to do it for free.

I'm all for art-house films and abstraction, but we need something to feed on here, a linear thread of some kind. As the film progresses you think maybe, just maybe, it has an Ace up its sleeve.

29508,"Michael Almereyda once again stuffs a Shakespearean play into modern day society and comes up with an incomprehensible mess. His film of ""Hamlet"" at least used as its framework an enduring masterpiece with themes as relevant to today's world as when it was written. But ""Cymbeline"" is an obscure, rarely produced oddity from Shakespeare's canon which employs unlikely plotting centered on obsolete sexual morality which has no relevance to today's world. Why Almereyda thought this archaic chestnut needed to be set in the present day is baffling.It is up to the actors to inject some life into this dull mess and for the most part, they are not up to the task. Dakota Johnson is stunning to look at as the ill-used Imogen, but gives a one-note performance that is insufferable to watch. Ethan Hawke brings to the evil Iachimo the same dull monotone that he employed as Almereyda's Hamlet. And Penn Badgley makes the gullible Posthumus seem like a refugee from a boy band. Only Delroy Lindo and Ed Harris project the charisma necessary to make their characters interesting, although demoting Harris' Cymbeline from the King of Britain in the original text to the head of a motorcycle gang is unimaginably reductive.Almereyda seems to have a fetish for updating Shakespearean drama into the modern world and has no issue with pummeling it into a different shape to fit his concept no matter what the Bard's original intention was while writing it. The approach worked intermittently with ""Hamlet"" but fails completely with ""Cymbeline."" Almereyda would be well advised to seek out contemporary stories to make films of and leave Shakespeare alone.",negative,movie

I won't tell you what parts were ripped off from the previously mentioned two movies (you'll need to suffer through the movie too) but you'll recognized them quite easily. The special effect for the ""dinos"" are pretty bad, I guess the ""dinos"" special effects team came cheap. The special effects for the death scenes were pretty good, with various people being relieved of certain body parts. Keep an eye out for the female team member toward the end of the movie; poor thing never had a chance.

30560,"I loved the situation. A small town, frustrated ex-military cop. But then the movie goes downhill pretty quickly. Story does not move at all. The end seems to be rushed. Climax is really tepid. Predictable and flat dialogs, the characters, especially the villains are not described in enough details. It feels like the director gave up halfway through the movie. I loved the situation, a small, sleepy, snowy town. But the rest was totally so-so. The story had a great potential. It is sad to see it being wasted like this. The 1954 original was much better.The actors also did not do justice. Liotta was just OK not very convincing. Erin Karpluk was good. Pidge and his grandpa were better. The rest of the actors were bad.",negative,movie
30712,"The plot lines in this movie are so bad, one would think this is a spoof. The redeeming factor is that the acting is just as bad so it really turns it into a comedy.let me give you three examples.First, Here is a critical mission to deliver 2 nuclear weapons to a site in LA, and it is ""protected"" by a small team in 1 truck and two jeeps. no backup, no eye-in-the-sky, no secondary communications, nothing. At one point they get stopped by the old ""truck in the middle of the road"" trick. They all get out and stand around when they are opened up on. These are elite soldiers on a critical mission to save the world? and they are stymied by a rogue team of bandits. And of course along for the ride is the cute scientist wearing stylish slacks and a cute sweater.Second, there is a father/daughter team of scientists. She hates him because he was not around. And he speaks glowingly of her and her work - to the point that it is revealed that he funded her research. But several times during the movie when she disagrees with him on scientific findings, he completely dismisses and insults her. Then the plot tries to turn the moment when we sees she is right into a tear jerking scene of father/daughter love. It's a complete failure.Third, one character hates the lead character so much that he continually jeopardizes the mission to save the world in order to make this one guy look bad.Fourth, two characters take off in a jeep with the second nuke needed to save the world in search of the main characters daughter. They didn't think of leaving it with the main team when they left? Oh, that's right, it was needed to add a little more drama in the plot.Fifth, when arming the nuclear weapon, the main character tells his daughter ""you better step back."" He's setting an arming device on a nuclear weapon and has her move 5 feet back? Oh, I see, that was needed for the bad guy to be able to grab her when he wasn't looking.I guess that was 5 things. I could have gone on even longer, but I think you get the point.Sappy speeches, bad character acting, typical inept politicians who can't make the right decisions and take all the credit when things go right, and a crazy serial killer in the mix who liked to threatens to burn a young woman but never seems to get around to actually doing anything.The only suspense in the movie was what next stupid turn was the plot going to take. I have to admit, I was surprised at times - because the turns were so unbelievable and dumb.",negative,movie

A small team headed up by a doctor called Lauren (Rachel Nichols) head out to Los Angeles to try to find uninfected survivors.Pandemic provides us with a fairly run-of-the-mill premise coupled with a fairly run-of-the-mill stock of characters and therefore I felt that it was never really striving for greatness. That being said, I did hope that it would turn out to be a fairly mindless and enjoyable 90 minutes, but this is far from great in my opinion.The main characters are either unlikeable, arrogant or just plain annoying which is something that will probably test most people's patience. They all resemble the usual clichés that we've come to see from other zombie/apocalyptic type films (only here none of them have any endearing qualities meaning that no-one will be bothered about what happens to any of them).The directing approach here is also rather odd; a lot of the shots are done from a first-person perspective which is OK when the shots focus on a single crew member going round an isolated building or when the protagonists are talking to one other, but this approach doesn't work so well during battle sequences or when someone is holding a gun up in front of the camera (this to me is a bit gimmicky and makes it look like a computer game). The chaotic way that the camera shifts around during the fight sequences only goes to reinforce the fact that this first-person camera approach doesn't always work.The fights with the infected do give the film some momentum and there are occasional moments of tension, but without a compelling story and without interesting or likable characters it is only some of the technical aspects that are driving the film forward and even these aspects of the film are nowhere near strong enough to make Pandemic worth watching.This film is 90 minutes long and in that time you could watch 2 episodes of the Walking Dead - my advice would be to do that rather than waste 90 minutes of your life watching this junk.",negative,movie

The vast majority of the characters now and in recent years are nasty, selfish people. There are very frequent rows, threats and violence. It's not entertaining in the slightest. How is the audience supposed to care about, root for or sympathise with any of these dreadful people?It's unrealistic in portraying most of the residents of the East End of London as working-class whites who all know each other well.

31948,"I like indie films and I'm prepared to give them slack that I wouldn't give to mainstream movies. I hated this movie. The acting was, throughout, bad. Sometimes painfully bad. Again, I can put up with that. Professional actors cost money that independent movie makers don't have and indie films give new talent a chance to make their marks. Plot and script writing on the other hand costs nothing and, in both, this movie literally falls apart. Horror movies, even the best of them, require a suspension of disbelief but, when the characters in horror movies start acting in ways that stretch credibility, you have a major problem. Example (one of many): There's a strange man in my new house. Response: Find a knife (check), find a light (check), take some pills, find a comfortable sofa, lie down, sleep till morning (nope). By the end I had completely lost interest in both the characters and the story line. The IMDb rating has been boosted by lots of positive reviews (no doubt from friends and family) and I'm confident it's only going to head in one direction. Don't waste your time watching it and, if you do, leave a suitable review. Don't be surprised however if your review is instantly attacked with lots of ""This review was not useful to me"" hits.",negative,movie
31972,"""Walled In"" definitely looked like a horror movie with massive potential and several aspects about the synopsis immediately appealed to me, like the guaranteed horrific theme of claustrophobic death, isolated buildings with a macabre past, lunatic architects and a slowly unfolding serial killer plot. I became even more convinced of the potential after witnessing the terrifically uncanny opening sequence in which a small child is trapped between four walls and screaming her lungs out whilst cement slowly filling up the concrete grave. This is a harsh and nightmarish sequence that you don't expect to see in modern day horror movie, so I started to feel very confident this could become a gem of a film. Unfortunately I shouted victory way too early again, as the walls of the productions literally come crashing down promptly after the opening credits. The screenplay is adapted from a graphic novel written by Canadian writer Serge Brussolo, and I certainly don't doubt the idea makes an absorbing book, but the film version is unstructured, confusing, preposterous and utterly implausible. Furthermore, the film itself is extremely unpleasant to look at what with its grainy photography, grim ambiance and vile characterizations. ""Walled In"" is one of those movies that make you nervous and uncomfortable without actually scaring anyone, so I was really glad when it was over. Sam Walczak is a freshly graduated engineer and the heiress of her family's destruction company. Her father offers her the opportunity to be in charge of her very own project: organizing and supervising the demolition of a remote and sinister apartment building, originally designed by the notoriously eccentric architect Joseph Malestrazza. The building has a dark past, as reputedly over 15 previous tenants were entombed in the walls, and Sam quickly experiences there's truth in the rumors. Together with the slightly offbeat teenage son of the evicted caretaker, she develops a theory that the mysteriously vanished architect might still be entrenched in the building. Pretentious and lethargic, ""Walled In"" is basically a totally absurd movie with an overload of transparent red herring and atmosphere building elements that are boldly stolen from other (and much better) genre classics. The ending is downright pathetic and actually a direct insult on the viewer's intelligence. Don't expect any gore or bloodshed, neither, just a whole lot of wannabe shocking undertones leading absolutely nowhere. The performances are very much below par and the overall conclusion regarding the film is, simply put, embarrassing. If these walls could talk  they would advise us to throw all copies of this movie in a hole in the basement and subsequently blow up the building.",negative,movie

Ralph Fiennes seems to be on an O.D. of Prozac, with a perennial foolish smile on his face, wishing he were Cary (or even Hugh!) Grant -- shame to see a talented actor in such a puffy role. Natasha Richardson is wasted in the obligatory dumb blonde part, Stanley Tucci hams it up irritatingly, Bob Hoskins knows and shows his role is an embarrassment.

Yes, its a bad film, very little on the side of character development and you do find yourself near the end wondering if you even care about these characters.Here's the premise, Kutcher plays Nikki a dude who is homeless and lazy, so he scouts out slightly older rich women to seduce and then mooch off of. Eventually he meets a woman he actually likes (i guess, its hard to tell what is sincerity in this film) which causes problems.Heres the main issue, Nikki is essentially a jerk with no ambitions, his voice over narration tries to give a sense of direction to this film but that fails. The main girl he falls for isn't a knockout in looks or personality, I mean shes decent but there's not much there.I cant complain much though, because I rented this DVD just wanting to have something nice to look at.

The reason VHS was so good (a reason of many) was that every segment seemed like it could actually be real, created by not rushing the horrors to unravel, a delicate art-form. VHS2 started off almost immediately ""explaining"" itself. Visually, it didn't sync. The high-def cameras diminished any sort of authenticity to then entire point of the movie.

33633,"Early Wes Craven effort shows off the young filmmaker's burgeoning interest in everyday horrors. Craven, working on an extremely limited budget, creates a familiar scenario with ordinary people and then throws sadism, humiliation and murder into the mix (he did this again a few years later with ""The Hills Have Eyes""). A drive-in variation on Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"", the film concerns two free-spirited young girls out to score some drugs but instead being abducted by escaped convicts. Craven has the germ of an interesting concept--allegedly based on a true incident--and he manages to mount the dread and terror effectively enough, but the movie is garbled and sludgy, not to mention depressing, with vapid, disgusting villains. Still, it's watchable until the revenge-laden second-half, which is so poorly written and executed it mitigates any real interest in the outcome.

34075,"Kurt Russell is a very competent actor. He has been in the Hollywood business since his childhood. Honestly, he should be able to see what movies would do well and what wouldn't. And like any other actor, he has made his fair share of mistakes; Soldier (1998) is one of those mistakes. However, I can not excuse him for (pardon the pun) missing the boat on this stinker. At least in Soldier (1998) Russell had a reason for not giving his character a lot of charm. Here, Russell is given a chance, but doesn't look like he put in a lot of effort. Perhaps he thought that what he was giving, was enough. I don't know.The plot is about a family who learns they have inherited a valuable boat and decide to take it upon themselves to sail it back to the US so they can get their money's worth. Low and behold, they end up being stuck with a native, Captain Ron (Russell), to lead them back to the US. The thing is, it's never specified if Captain Ron IS a captain. He's more like a klutzy half drunken sailor. This is the whole joke of the movie, and it falls flat right when Kurt Russell enters the frame. It just doesn't work. There's no charm or a spark of inventiveness. Nothing. Unfortunately, the other characters aren't any better either. Co- starring with Russell is Martin Short, another veteran actor. Ask me why he chose this movie, I couldn't say. Short plays the father, Mr. Harvey, and originally he doesn't mind Captain Ron but gradually begins to see that he isn't really qualified for the job. This kind of friction isn't really a recipe for comedy. As I sat through this, I just became frustrated with how dysfunctional the Harvey family and Captain Ron was. Just utter chaos. I'm surprised any of them were able to make it back to the US in one piece.The comedy aspect of this movie is extremely weak as well. Nothing is funny here at all. The gags are actually more obvious in a literal sense; you can see actors preparing on screen for an upcoming gag! Even weirder was how bad of a role model Captain Ron was to the children of the Harvey family. Not to mention that the parents barely objected to anything he did. Great parenting. Which brings me to another point - the rating. I understand this movie was rated R for language and some nudity but really? I honestly think it would have been funnier without it. I mean, what purpose does a child actor have in a movie if the age restriction is only for adults 17 and up? There's no connection with the audience. This is why the screenwriter, John Dwyer, has only this movie to his credit. It is by no means well written at all.As for the music...what music? The composer, Nicholas Pike, who has done a large number of scores, provided barely anything for this movie. No theme, no emotion, nothing. All the audience gets, is native music. Fine, but it is at the most random of times and doesn't lighten up the mood of the movie much, if at all. The only saving grace in this movie is Kurt Russell as bad as he is. The scenery is nice, as well as the native cultures displayed throughout, but that's it. This boat is a sinker to the bottom.By far, this is Kurt Russell's worst movie. The music is barely there, the humor is sorely unfunny and the characters have no charm.",negative,movie

34339,"Ten years ago, two guys, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, put together a scary little film on a peanut-shell budget and utilized the still-fledgling Internet to create a seemingly ""paranormal"" phenomenon which became known as The Blair Witch Project. The film was shot from a first person perspective of an amateur film crew out to investigate ""paranormal activity"" stemming from a spooky little backwoods legend. The effects were simple, yet spine-chillingly effective and many folks began re-thinking the whole camping idea. It was an amazingly original idea and to this day, I still consider the film and its marketing campaign a work of genius. It was something new and without a doubt, prompted the whole ""reality"" scene we are all too familiar with today.Now, fast forward to present day and we have been shelled with a film which attempts to capitalize on all the elements that made Blair effective. This time, however, the gimmicks are a mere hodgepodge of unoriginality from its shallow introduction of the protagonists to the dragging around on the floor REC (Quarantine) style, to the open-ended questions that are meant to linger in our minds when the final credits role. To boot, there is this very suspicious marketing campaign that borders on the edge of unethical where screenings and online reviews more than likely have been staged by greedy film execs to hype up that which just isn't worthy of the hype. Let's see we have shadows, doors opening and closing, chandeliers swinging, sinister voices, and a whole lota' screams from the female lead. We even have a Ouija board. I am not kidding. They are pulling all the stops on all the haunted house gags this time. I found myself wondering when Abbott and Costello were going to run through the room chased by a dangling skeleton. The most fun you might have watching this little venture is if you bring along a pad and pen and jot down which film each of the overplayed ""scares"" are stolen from. Then, however, you still are forced to endure the most boring of sequences to make it to the next evening all the while dismissing all logic to believe a couple would even remain in this haunted house.Frankly, I am very disappointed. I had hoped for a fun and scary ride with Paranormal Activity but it turned out to be nothing more than pretentious in an annoying sort of way. What is most ""disturbing"" is this clatter and clang of borderline heresy I keep hearing that suggests Paranormal Activity gauges up there with films such as The Exorcist. If you can look me in the eye and keep a straight face while trying to convince me that such fear can be derived here, I will most certainly wince with a disgusted perplexity and reply, ""Surely you jest...""",negative,movie
34407,"Oh so clichéd, oh so contrived, oh so predictable. We've seen it all a hundred times before.The film begins with our ""loving"" couple having a raucous, protracted argument; the vehicle chosen (curiously) by the director to convey the depth and sincerity of their relationship, and during which, on several occasions our Irishman calls his wife ""baby"". Irishmen don't say ""baby"". This unconvincing beginning sets the tone for the rest of the film. What a disappointment; and from the same writer/director and leading lady who gave us the excellent Freedom Writers. What happened here?Hilary Swank looks uncomfortably miscast in this role, she turns in a flat, mediocre performance, and there is a palpable lack of chemistry between her and her on-screen husband Gerard Butler. They really are the most unlikely couple. Added to which, neither of the two supposedly Irish men (Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan) can manage a proper Irish accent. The script is weak and pretentious and the storyline lacks authenticity. Billed as a romantic comedy, it is neither romantic nor funny. It simply does not work. This film is coated with a wafer thin veneer of pathos, humour and romanticism; a veneer which cracks under the slightest examination to reveal the emptiness within.If there were a category for ""cringe"" value it would score 10, but for spectator value it just scrapes a 2.",negative,movie
34426,"I really just don't know why people like this movie so much. I typically really enjoy this genre (Anchorman, Knocked Up, etc.), but this just didn't work on any level. The friend I watched it with, who also loves pretty much any comedy, felt the same way. Throughout the entire movie, I failed to laugh once -- I only mildly chuckled a few times (rather forced chuckles at that). The movie somewhat held my interest for the first part when Paul Rudd is struggling to find a best friend, but as soon as he meets Jason Segal - when you think it will get good - it derails. The ending with the wedding was just plain brutal -- terrible writing, acting, etc. Yet, most people I talk to like this movie, which just blows my mind. I never thought I'd say this about a Paul Rudd movie.",negative,movie

The story is full of cliché. The world and characters simply don't hold together in any sort of internal logic, and thus I lost interest in them as the film wore on. And it did wear on... me. The creature effects and cinematography were well done for the most part, though there are some obvious compositing glitches in the larger sets.

I remember watching the original Halloween when I was in my early teens and being somewhat freaked out by it. But maybe I've changed in the last 35 years. I found this utterly dull from start to 80 minutes in, when my body gave rebelled and fell asleep. Even when I was awake I couldn't really tell you what the plot was apart from, preposterously, Michael escapes exactly 40 years to be the day (forgetting all the apparently forgettable sequels) that he was captured.

35108,"The Devil's Rejects is a horrible, horrible film. No, not horrible in the sense that the imagery is disturbing or violent; it isn't nearly as much as has been hyped. It's horrible because it's just straight-up disappointing and a huge waste of time.First of all, House of 1000 Corpses is a film I initially had some problems with. The flashy editing techniques and stuff distracted from the story, which really didn't go anywhere at all. However, the more I watched it, the more I put my mind to rest on most of that stuff (despite it eventually turning into a mess at the end of the film, which I will never forgive). It is and always will be one of the craziest and most easy-to-re-watch ""horror"" movies ever, with style to burn, humor, trash and chaos. I dunno why people refer to it as a music video or whatever people want to insult it with; the film is just a straight-up exciting and fun watch. It's nu-horror, but it's an example of a good film in the post-Scream world.Devil's Rejects, on the other hand, is just bad bad bad. Zombie took all the good elements of House and didn't apply them to this film at all. I might as well get my praises for the film out of the way immediately: The directing is competent, there's a certain throat-slitting scene that is well-done, Captain Spaulding was pretty funny, the music was fitting, and the film wasn't another ""teens-get-lost-in-the-woods"" kind of flick that has recently reemerged... but, yeah, that's pretty much all I can say about it.The film was just completely straight-up retarded. The ending is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. They tried everything they could do to make the film disturbing, to the point where they should have just thrown a big red flashing sign above the movie theater that said ""BE DISTURBED BY THIS. THIS IS A DISTURBING FILM."", similar to one of those ""APPLAUSE NOW"" signs that they supposedly have at late-show tapings.I mean, you have a gun being stuck in a vagina. There is a face-wearing scene similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. There is some cocaine and ""Freebird"" being played for about 7 minutes of its 17 minute length as we see slow motion shots of gnatty hair. BE DISTURBED! It was just so laughably bad, hard to totally convey in words. Later in the film, they had a few interesting elements, like the Unholy Two (two bad dudes with muscles who violently.. uh.. CALL THE SHERIFF WITH INFORMATION!!) and the bad-cop-gets-revenge angle and all that, but those elements were never explored to a satisfying degree. The film was pretty much plot less and occasionally teetered on ""totally unwatchable"".I'm not going to tell you all not to see it, because there are certainly people out there who have never seen better films whose mind will be blown by this atrocity. But there isn't a whole lot to recommend here. The whole movie was about hiding in hotels, for crying out loud. And the whole ""this movie is disturbing!"", ""this movie is violent!"" thing got old really quickly. I can't recall a single violent aspect of this film except a few gunfights and the overlong torture scenes near the end. Yay. Bad film.",negative,movie

Most of the women in the audience were riveted forward in their seats - while the men were rolling their heads and checking the time. One poor guy was sleeping. The primary reason we attended was based on Clint Eastwood's association with the movie. We expected more insight, more direct connection - and to walk out feeling there just may be an afterlife.

Was told that this equaled The Hangover, whoever make that comparison was sadly mistaken. Though I do enjoy Michael Cera as an actor, along with the other big names who show up in the movie, the story line was just not well written. The idea is good but it is not backed up with good characters. It seemed like an extension of Cera's Superbad character with the exception he actually gets laid.

35396,"This movie is often compared to Shrek.  I found no comparisons but for the main character and the animated look. This movie offers a story line spread so thinly that it tore within the first 30 minutes.  I didn't laugh once in the first hour before I decided to get up and write how boring this movie is.  The little girl is cute, but offers no surprises, and has very little attitude for supposedly a scary presence.  The monsters remind me of the blue-collar characters from the row houses of Baltimore.  The viewer is not allowed any kind of reference to any of the monsters past or their future. The entire movie is predictable, boring and difficult to watch. You will not likely run across anyone that says they have watched this movie multiple times as they did with Shrek.  I give it a 2 of 10, and advise anyone that expects to see anything mythical, creative, or enchanting to avoid this movie.There's not even one good line in Monsters Inc.  Remember from Shrek..""Yes.

This was just a bad movie with no realism and, really, no suspense...the whole thing just wasn't believable. How Sandra Bullock's character was not screened out of the space program due to her emotional problems caused by the sudden death of her four year old child cannot be explained. George Clooney's character was a modern day Don Juan (apparently the only role Clooney is comfortable portraying) and is about as realistic as Johnny Depp's role as Tonto in ""The Lone Ranger.""

A vague lesson spoon-fed to the audience during the first 20 minutes is I'm guessing what is supposed to excuse the senseless and bumbling bore of a circus for the next 100.I absolutely do not understand the praise of the acting in this film. I never bought into the actors as their roles, though, honestly, there was not much else holding it together for me. Was there a script? Was there a director??? The entire sad excuse for a film seemed to be the improvised work of the actors themselves contrived in a garage somewhere after a long night of drinking.I never was really motivated to read into the movie, and I was never really fully engaged or entertained by the shallow antics, long-hanging scenes that go on way too long, or 70's retro-obsession. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be mesmerized by watching makeup applied to Christian Bale's head or how cool walking into a 70's themed wardrobe would be. It seemed none of the actors could keep their accents. I would never label this as a comedy-- I did laugh from time to time because of how badly I wanted it to be over.For a respectable story about individuals trying to reinvent themselves please see The Great Gatsby, The Departed, or The Town (and I'm sure there are many more).",negative,movie

It has pretensions towards being something akin to Goodfellas or the Godfather, but it simply lacks the credibility to fall into such a category. The idea that a middle class non-entity like the character played by Daniel Craig could be a successful cocaine dealer is ludicrous to begin with, but the threshold of credulity is well and truly smashed when we discover that the arch-villain in the film is played by a particularly unconvincing Michael Gambon. Gambon comes across as a librarian putting on a fake Cockney accent, not as an established criminal kingpin.

36252,"Kung Fu Hustle reviewed by Sam Osborn.rating: 1.5 out of 4A couple years ago a little film called Shaolin Soccer tripped into theaters after being endlessly shuffled around by distributors. The film didn't get around to my area, so I rented it out of the godly Netflix a few months later. I expected a nicely goofy rendition of the typical formula soccer film with some interesting kung fu. What I got was a diluted mess of amateur CGI and a screenplay that seemed to be regurgitated from the mind of an infant. Not much more can be said about Chow's latest outing, Kung Fu Hustle. It's little more than a poor video game concept brought to the big screen. With no story, half-baked characters, and the stupidest sense of humor this side of Barney, Kung Fu Hustle is one of the most critically overrated films in years. That being said, some credit must be given to Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung for their brilliant choreography. Also, it can't go without saying that Stephen Chow does show some hints of talent among this convoluted disaster. He obviously has a sharp eye for visual treats and a creativity that can't be matched. But why does he waste it on this high budget, low grade comedy? I just don't understand. If you must know, there's some excuse for a plot dumped out by the screenplay in the opening sequence. In pre-revolution China, gangs ruled the land. The biggest and most terrible of these gangs was the Axe Gang (original, I know). This Axe Gang goes through each town demanding tribute and killing all who refuse with, yes, axes. That is, until they stumble upon Pigsty Alley. Hidden within Pigsty Alley are a myriad of kung fu masters, all of whom duke it out with a warrior from the Axe Gang. But Pigsty Alley would be lost if it weren't for, wait for it, the chosen one. You get the idea. The whole film plays out like one of those fighting games on video game consoles. If you haven't played one, they consist of a short CGI back-story explaining the beef between the two characters, then an extended duel of boxing, shooting, slicing, kicking, etc. After all this is over, you do it again. Kung Fu Hustle essentially pulls the same trick, creating cute good guys and diabolic bad guys to duke it out in CGI madness, where real prowess in kung fu is certainly not necessary. I have a feeling Yuen Wo Ping spent much more of his time choreographing a computer programmer than an actor. Amidst all this fighting, Chow crams in his trademark ""humor"". This consists of many jokes concerning flatulence, male nudity, haphazard and silly slapstick, and males harassing females. It's just not funny. The humor has been related to that of Buster Keaton and the greats of the early years of cinema. From what I've seen of Mr. Keaton's work, I think he'd cry if he heard that.",negative,movie
36296,"Weirdly, Spartacus is out of Stanley Kubrick's style, a plain epic, visually plain, the content is plain, direction is plain... I don't know why, but I always see Spartacus and Ben Hur as like as two peas, may be so that they come from the same period. I don't compare Spartacus with Ben Hur, but it cannot be another Ben Hur, Ben Hur was much better, if you ask me. Spartacus is not a spectacular epic. The movie is not boring, I did not get bored at all, but it is not interesting enough throughout and as I said, everything is plain, in addition, there was nothing great. Except the final that I will mention later, there is not any scene memorable or impressive that I would talk about. May be I should mention the sword fight scene. There is a sword fight in the movie and it was really engaging and entertaining. However, the rest is like a straight, plain line. As for Stanley Kubrick, he is one of my all time favorite directors, but Spartacus is not like a Kubrick movie at all, you know almost every movie he made was different, extraordinary, but Spartacus is not. As you know, may be he is the most perfectionist director ever lived and his style was not distinguishable, but just impressive. In fact, it would be enough, if I just said perfectionist. However, Spartacus is an exception in his filmography. Kirk Douglas is also one of my all time favorite actors too, but unfortunately cannot save the movie. Before watching, I had known that Spartacus is not a historical action movie, no battles scenes etc. so I did not disappointed on this count, otherwise, Spartacus would have been a bigger disappointment to me.

36303,"On a criminological point of view this film is absolutely moronic and the plot strings together in a ridiculous fusion. Alfred Hitchcock is heralded as a genius though there are very noticeable and unforgivable flaws in his work. A much superior film he directed is Rear Window"", but even in that film he displays a ridiculous plot point of where the girl is saved by the police who show up roughly only a minute and a half after they have been called...... If only In the real world. Anyhow, compared to ""Rear Window"", this film is very mediocre and frankly it is unfathomable how it reached the top 250 movies list. I do not really wish to divulge many spoilers but the viewer deserves some substance to my criticism.The plot consists of 2 men meeting on the train. One of them a little mentally disturbed who wishes to kill his father and discovers that the other man, a famous tennis player is at odds with his wife. In the end the deranged man has this idea of the perfect murder where each of the 2 men will ""do the other man;s murder"" problems: When the deranged man murders the man's wife, he first waits outside her house for possibly hours, then follows her and 2 of her male friends to an amusement park, all through the park, ride after ride intent on killing her, and she never finds his presence odd. Finally after getting off the boat ride with her companions the man follows them where she LUCKILY gets separated so the man can commit...... the PERFECT MURDER.... apparently because the 2 men FOUND her body they are immediately ruled out as suspects... Remind me the next time I kill someone to do it in a dark park and be the first one to find them... Now in Hitchcock land the number one suspect is... her HUSBAND, whos only alibi at the time of the murder is a drunkard on a train back to his home in another town... how the killer managed to reach his house to meet him before he got there first I have no idea. Without being able to go much further before ruining the plot, all this time the psychotic man is holding onto the initiated lighter of the tennis player as an insurance policy that he will ""do HIS murder"" by killing his father, otherwise the psycho man threatens to drop the lighter at the scene of the crime. This is the laughable part; All the while, the tennis player is afraid to call the police on the madman for fear of being involved..... even though he is stalked...... even though the crazy man shows up at his second wife's fathers estate party and nearly strangles a woman to death without being invited. He was even seen at the murder site while the tennis player was far away on a train. But no... Intelligence equals lack of plot in this movie. In REAL LIFE cases such as this, the 2 men would have AGREED to this insane so called perfect murder idea and perhaps later the 2nd man decides to back out. In the first place were it to work, it would be awkward and difficult to maintain no proof that the 2 ever met (as evidenced in the movie).In short; Hitchcock may be entertaining to mystery lovers, but he is lamentable to crime lovers, because here the whole story appears very implausible and slapped together. His only range for brilliance consists of an entire movie centered around setting of a man who can do nothing but look out of his apartment window. (Rear Window) It is very funny to me how Alfred Hitchcock is so heralded because the very same caliber of film made for example by the likes of Dario Argento, today would only get as high as a 6.0 rating at best. If you don't believe me, by all means, view a Dario Argento movie and you will witness no less originality and no more plausibility....

We were hoping season 5 would be strong. It was horrible!Yes, horrible. Patronizing in its commentary on AI. Root destroys any sense of credibility, even by Sci Fi standards. It wallows in self indulgent nonsense and meaningless repetitive violence. How many times can people be shot and not die?

I understand that romances are an integral part of stories and movies, and there's obviously a demand for it in general considering the amount of it on TV and the big screen.
But in a documentary about climbing El Capitan free solo. One of the most amazing, scary, and difficult tasks someone has ever done. For 90% of the movie to be about their relationship and the emotional disconnect between Alex's climbing and his girlfriend, with footage of them doing mundane things, rather than the climb, preparation, and background/history of Alex and his climbing, is just the most underwhelming things i have ever watched regarding mountaineering.

A capable director Vishal Bharadwaj, who has the worthiness to work on literal plots and turn them into unembellished masterpieces have failed miserably in this movie. Nothing except cinematography that appeals. Half hearted attempt of acting, including Tabu -who does brilliant in one scene and utterly poor performance in another, Shahid Kapoor's same in one shot -ridiculous in another, marks the acting skills of two leading characters. Irrfan Khan, who was perfect to the point, hardly got much screen presence. The movie has mindless scenes of killing even when it doesn't make sense; comedy using film star Salman Khan's popularity even when it wasn't necessary and desired. What was director thinking?

I don't know if we're supposed to admire Applegate's character, but I found her thoroughly obnoxious. I think she was supposed to be some sort of feminist standard-bearer, but the politics are clumsy and dragged in by the scruff of the neck. Not many characters elicit sympathy, the male characters deliberately so - yet again we have a cast of one-dimensional, lame-brained men just lining up to be put in their place by the ladies. These gals don't need anyone except each other - and by the way, does anyone in 2019 still find two chicks getting gigglingly high on the beach together funny any more?
Applegate's character, in contrast to the men, is supposed to be layered and complex, but she allows her loss to define her. We have all suffered grief, but no-one I know brings the tragedy up in EVERY. SINGLE. CONVERSATION. For someone so ""ballsy"" she has allowed the loss of a loved one to dominate her life and mould her character. Fortunately, the police officer she harasses allows her access right to her desk at any time of the day or night and doesn't seem to have a lot else going on - she stops everything and, with a world weary sigh, indulges this manic victim's every whim.

37441,"The problem with bringing Holmes into the modern era is that we have technology that makes crime solving a lot easier and his skills of deduction less impressive. And with that modern technology, the police are capable of coming to many of the same conclusions--just not as quickly. So, the show decided to make the cops and medical examiners around Holmes that much dumber in order to make him seem that much smarter. If SHERLOCK were the only crime drama on the air, it would be okay. But unfortunately for SHERLOCK, we have A TON of crime dramas on TV, so fans of the genre are well-versed in TV forensic procedure. Even the dumbest cops and medical examiners on those other shows are smarter than the cops and medical examiners on SHERLOCK. And that really frustrated me while watching the series.I also found the Holmes character a little too mean spirited (even for Holmes) in the first episode. Although he does calm down a bit for the other two episodes, I never connected with the Holmes character. And this could be my least favorite portrayal of the character (my favorite being by the late and great Jeremy Brett). I have other plot-specific gripes with the series, but I will refrain from spoilers.Out of love for Sherlock Holmes, I watched all three episodes, hoping it would get better. I was sorely disappointed.Bringing a Holmes-type character into modern times is tough, but it is possible to do it without making everyone around him morons (see House, Monk).

There were a few well done visual effects (I really liked the demon and the cocoons) and the acting was alright, especially for an independent film like this.Unfortunately, that's where the good points end.The editing was so bad that I spent half of the movie wondering if I missed some very important part that would let me follow the story. I rewound and realized that I didn't miss anything.There were a few very pretentious dialogue scenes that seemed to be put in for no other reason than to show how ""cool"" the movie writers are. Although they were the best scripted scenes, they had nothing to do with the plot. Maybe if they had been cut there would have been time for some scenes that explain what is actually going on.The ending...could someone explain?

37855,"Granted, I didn't have much of any high expectations to the 2008 movie ""Lava Storm"" when I sat down to watch it here in 2020. In fact, I hadn't even heard of the movie. And given the synopsis, then chances were high that this was going to be another low budget disaster movie with a predictable plot and questionable CGI effect.Turns out that it was exactly that. The plot and storyline was so generic that it was essentially pointless and non-existing. A volcanic eruption destroys an American city and it is up to the 5 members of a single local family to stop the forces of nature and put an end to the destruction. Questionable? Yes. Stupid? Yes. Predictable? Yes. This was as generic as it could possibly be. And you knew the outcome of the movie even before it started.As for the special effects, well it was a combination of stock footage from what I assume was documentaries and some laughable CGI effects, which hardly fooled anyone into believing them to be real. And I loved the fact that they used footage of an ocean brushing against molten lava rock when the dam burst. If a dam bursts, the water flows continuously, and it doesn't ebb and flow. It was just so stupid. The props and sets were equally questionable as the special effects.The acting in the movie was as you'd expect from a movie such as this. But people actually did fairly with their performances, given the fact that they had next to nothing to work with.If you enjoy disaster movies, you shouldn't be wasting your time with ""Lava Storm"".

37988,"Bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny. The ""plot"" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film he's called a ""military adviser"" but it's not really clear if he's in the American military or not), helping the army of a Latin-American country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him, imprisons and tortures him. Shannon Tweed is a ""sports equipment saleswoman"" he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue. That description actually makes the movie sound better than it is, because it's really a stinker of almost Biblical proportions. How bad is it? Well, Shannon Tweed turns in the movie's most professional acting job. If that isn't an indication of just what a 12th-rate piece of junk this turkey is, nothing is. From mismatched sound effects to a music score that sounds like it's from a 1940s ""Z""-grade horror flick (and may very well be) to the same footage (i.e., the same armored personnel carriers going down the same jungle trail) reused constantly to some of the most ineptly staged ""action"" scenes in recent memory, this laugh-a-minute groaner has to be seen to be disbelieved. Tweed looks bored, Brown looks hung over, and by the time this thing is finished--if you can last that long; I couldn't--you'll know just how they feel.Although there are a lot of explosions and gunfights, this can't be considered an ""action"" picture by any stretch of the imagination. It's boring (there's a scene in the back of a truck where everybody just stares at each other for three or four minutes), repetitive (the same ""rebels"" and ""soldiers"" being killed over and over), illogical (when a group of rebels is caught in an open field by a government helicopter gunship, instead of breaking for cover they just stand there staring up at it), inept (soldiers and rebels falling ""dead"" when no gunshots are heard, a gun battle inside a house where combatants standing against walls are machine-gunned but miraculously the walls escape undamaged) predictable (when the ""Governor"" says to offer a reward for Brown's capture because ""someone"" might turn him in, you know exactly who that ""someone"" will be, and it turns out to be exactly who you thought it was) and just downright stupid (pretty much everything else in the picture).

Here's my biggest beef with this ""movie"". THE MUSIC. Did the producers owe a debt to some local rappers because the soundtrack is so bad that it's actually funny. Whether the scene is sad or serious or funny, it's the same horrible rap music.The plot is ridiculous, the set design was non-existent, the dialogue was enough to put a baby to sleep. They literally walked out of jail with not so much as a chase scene.

38111,"...nonsense you'll have seen in a while. DEADTIME is an affront to the British film industry, a total waste of time and money for all involved (not talent though, because there's no talent gone into this) and one of the very worst films I've seen in a good while. I always seem to be saying that, but this really is poverty row stuff, with no redeeming values whatsoever.The 'storyline' sees the talentless members of a music group set up shop in a rambling old mansion ready for a new shoot. While there they fall prey to a masked, knife-wielding maniac who offs them one by one. Even worse, the psycho killer may well be one of their own, killing them due to one unknown grievance or another.To say that this is poor is to understate matters, because it doesn't get any worse than this. We get acting that ranges between the stilted and the completely over the top, with no middle ground. The narrative that involves characters pairing up and going off to have sex before being slaughtered in unappealing death scenes. There's unpleasant sexual violence, some absolutely awful CGI gore effects, and a couple of one-scene cameos from Terry Christian and Leslie Grantham apiece. It's an amateur hour production that should be avoided at all costs.",negative,movie

And since I hadn't already seen it, of course I took the time to sit down and watch it.Now, the movie should have been titled ""None Remains"" because this is how I feel the movie will do to you; you just get up and turn it off. I managed to endure 47 minutes of pure torture before I had enough, caved in and gave up. Nothing of any worth or interest happened in these very, very long 47 minutes. And I can't really claim to have had any interest in the characters either.Everything in those abysmal 47 minutes was just pointless and bland.The storyline and plot in ""One Remains"" was lacking. I seriously have no idea what writers Nancy Criss, Josh Hodgins, Vanessa Leigh and Laura Megan Stahl were trying to accomplish with ""One Remains"". But pretty impressive that not one, but four, writers manage to produce something this unappealing. That is quite an accomplishment in itself.As for the acting, well I didn't recognize anyone on the cast list, which is always a plus for me. I am sure that the actors and actresses were doing good enough jobs to the extend of their abilities, but they virtually had nothing - and I seriously mean that - to work with in terms of script, plot and storyline.I am rating ""One Remains"" a generous two out of ten stars solely because the movie did seem to have adequate production value at least.If you enjoy a good horror movie, do yourself a favor and stay well clear of ""One Remains"".

The gameplay is atrocious, as it's not only confusing as hell, but fights just aren't fun thanks to how bland, repetitive, and, as I said, confusing they are. The story mode is dumb, as it's extremely predictable and down right unrewarding. The roster, while it does have Shaq himself, is filled with the most generic fighting characters ever that have little to nothing special about them other than their appearance. Overall, this game has absolutely jack squat when it comes to enjoyment. The only thing kind of praisable are the visuals, as they look great for the SNES and Sega Genesis. But that hardly matters when everything else is just terrible, which is why I recommend everyone to stay away from this immense disappointment altogether. I wanted to love this game, because the premise is awesome. But, it was ruined by pretty much everything.

So, in this case, it is an apt title. The simple problem with this film is nothing happens; and it seems forever to occur. Our four heroes (sorry, two heroes and two women, judging by the subservient roles given to the female leads, and the bleak plot warning that if you step out of line, men will hate and leave you) go down in a dodgy diving bell, which conveniently fails at depth near an underwater cave that glows in the dark (phosphorus they explain). I could be critical of the science at this point, but this claim pales with the completely unexplained manner they can snorkel in and out of the diving bell without it being flooded.Anyway, once they reach the Incredible Petrified World (aka small cave with glowing walls), they eventually meet a stranger who claims he got there from a shipwreck 14yrs ago. Now, it would have been good if they explained how he might have been able to swim so deep without being scuba supported, although it would have been better to explain why they chose to make him look like Chico Marx with a Santa beard, and wearing caveman clothes.And thats the main problem; you don't mind putting up with the first three quarters being tedious if there is a payoff.

While I was watching this all I could think of was how good Arachnophobia actually was.

Katherine Heigl was very wooden in her role, but then again...she did not have much to work with.

What they don't realise is that the lady is a cannibalistic witch who intends to eat them. It's enough to give kids sleepless nights.BreadCrumbs, which is inspired by Hansel and Gretel, is the opposite: it's likely to send its viewers soundly off to sleep. Directed by Mike Nichols (NOT the one who gave us The Graduate), the film is about as bland and forgettable as horror gets, with unlikeable characters, dull kills, and an uninspired plot that provides little exposition (why are the kids homicidal, how are they able to pop up anywhere at any time, and where are they getting their candy from?).

Interesting too is the Easter Egg hunt the titular child participates in (the eggs and baskets are also black).  Once the story gets rolling, it never really 'rolls'...

41240,"Hailed as a throwback to old-school slashers but in reality this is an incredibly poor movie with very little going for it.While I did guess the identity of the killer before the film even reached the halfway mark, there is another twist towards the end involving the killers mother that is indeed quite twisted. The Santa costume is also quite good, and there are a couple of decent gore scenes. That's it for the positives.Most of the gore, while plentiful, just isn't very entertaining and the killers weapon of choice (a pair of hedge clippers) isn't utilized to its full potential.Furthermore, the acting is wooden, with few exceptions, and the majority of the characters are obnoxious teenagers who make some of the dumbest decisions you've ever seen. There's also a pointless shower scene with no nudity, and the movie completely ignores a golden opportunity for a lesbian scene. I felt cheated.In short, a failure that obviously doesn't know its audience very well, not that I'm the biggest slasher fan to begin with. For desperate gorehounds only.",negative,movie

Good for you, but generally speaking and lets keep it real here: this is not good by any standard. Maybe the cinematography, but that's about it.The acting is weak, the script is weak, there are no big effects here. And while the characters are not teenagers, they act as if they were (brainless) but even worse: their charisma level is below zero. And likeable is also different.

41764,"Any science fiction film that's got Michael Gough playing a character called The Master of the Moon has to be worthy of it being something less than outright awful. At that time in his career Gough was doing almost as many British horror films as Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.They Came From Beyond Space involves a race of aliens who are like the Organians from Star Trek totally incorporeal. But they sure have a lot of problems that the Organians don't seem to have. It's necessitated them taking over some earthly bodies as they come to earth hitchhiking on meteors. Of course being as smart as the Organians they take over some scientists who operate in the United Kingdom. Except for expatriate American Robert Hutton who because he had a metal plate put in his head is somehow immune from takeover. But he sees all around him acting strangely including scientist girl friend Jennifer Jayne. That prompts him to take action.For a guy who recently sustained a head injury Hutton certainly gets involved in a lot of fights, anyone of them could have done him in permanently. That is the nature of it for folks with plates in their heads. But that's just a minor point.They Came From Beyond Space is poorly written, poorly edited, with amateurish special effects and a story that makes some of those Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers serials look believable. On the other hand it has Michael Gough hamming it up as The Master Of The Moon.Gough might even convince you the Moon is made of green cheese and that's what the Organians eat.",negative,movie

I have always been a fan of the Kummeli sketch series and have enjoyed some of the previous movies, but this one was all different.The problem with sketch comedy may often be that the jokes are not funny enough. That was not the case with this movie, since it barely had any jokes at all. Apparently the makers had figured that a couple of outrageously homosexual men are enough to make people laugh for nearly two hours.The plot is very simple and not enough to make the movie a serious attempt at drama, and I seriously doubt that was the intention.

Use the effect to accentuate points or set- ups....not the entire flick! It's a headache to watch. Every time an actor spoke...I groaned. Every decision they made...I groaned. Every attempt to make these characters seem 'real' ...I groaned.

That just makes this movie all the worse. This movie looked it might have actually had some interesting bits. They showed this new sport called sidehacking. It looked pretty stupid, but it certainly would have been better than most of the film.It's a really stupid revenge movie that moves slowly. We see flashbacks of stuff that happened right away, like twice. The voices in this movie are so annoying. These characters are all so obnoxious. They get everything wrong.

42083,"The conversation of the portrayal of women in video games is, at the very least, a topic that warrants exploration. Sadly, this isn't that.Probably the biggest problem with Tropes vs. Women is how it conducts itself. Typically when you do research on a topic you do so in an attempt to reach a conclusion based on your findings. Anita Sarkeesian and Jonathan McIntosh seem to only conduct research in order to find material to support pre-existing conclusions they made on the topic long before this series even reached it's inception. Anything that doesn't conform to their confirmation bias is either ignored or passed off as a rare anomaly. Probably the biggest disconnect is where Sarkeesian comes from. She is, before all else, a marxist feminist. This is not an accusation, merely a factual statement, and as such Sarkeesian employs a collectivist view in her analysis that is largely incompatible with the individualist mentality behind gamer subculture and geek subculture in general, where the old adage of ""if you don't like it, then don't watch/play/read it"" is more than sufficient. That's not where Sarkeesian and McIntosh come from. To them, Catwoman being sexy is part of a larger systemic issue.In other words, Sarkeesian is not a gamer. That's not to say she doesn't play games, but she is, by her own admission, not a part of the fandom. Gamers are not her audience. Her audience consists of the largely uninitiated; professors and students mostly unfamiliar with the scene who've yet to form an opinion on the matter.Some of her videos are good, though probably not for the reasons she wanted them to be. Her video on the Scythian, for example, is a brilliant examination why silent protagonists are so effective in games. But as a feminist critique... well, if the only way for you to NOT be offended by a female character is to make her a shapeless blob that never talks and acts only as a blank slate for you to project yourself onto, you might have other problems you need to work through.So if you're a long-time gamer with many a-happily-wasted-hours under your belt, regardless of your gender, you're likely going to find yourself rolling your eyes at a lot of her conclusions.",negative,movie
42469,"Generally I have an immense dislike for The Asylum's movies, but some are watchable so I do keep watching as there is something about their awfulness that is kind of compelling. There is much worse from The Asylum than Age of Dinosaurs and it is certainly better than SyFy's Jurassic Attack aka Rise of the Dinosaurs, but that isn't saying much to praise it. The best asset is the acting, not great but not that bad for The Asylum. Treat Williams and Ronny Cox look very at ease in their roles and are solid. There are a few non-entities in some of the bitty roles but overall the acting could have been worse. The music score also wasn't so bad, it does move things forward a little, doesn't distract and I can still remember parts, again it's improved from past efforts. I cannot say the same for the rest of Age of Dinosaurs(what an inane title) though. It is a very cheap movie visually, the editing is as choppy as you'd expect from The Asylum with scenes not fitting seamlessly together, you'll also have a field day spotting continuity errors. Even worse are the special effects for the dinosaurs, they move so awkwardly and they are designed in a way that makes them look like a failed high school project from 25-30 years ago. The dialogue has layers of cheese and sounds like the actors were having difficulty uttering it with any natural feeling. A lot of the lines are clichéd and any banter has a tendency to go overboard. The story reads of a dumbed down parody of both Jurassic Park and King Kong, but with none of the charm or thrills. Instead it is utter stupidity and predictable storytelling, with cartoon-ish, unimaginative attacks and tedious pacing. It is also very thin from a structural point of view, there isn't enough to sustain the length and make it up there is a lot of pointless filler that only succeeds in bogging the movie down. The characters are as clichéd as the writing, they are also very annoying and as well as having no development are made to do things that a lot of people would deem embarrassing. The dinosaurs also have no personality whatsoever and judging from people's reactions to them they don't seem to come across as much of a threat. On the whole, I've seen worse but if you are looking for a good or entertaining dino movie you are best leaving Age of Dinosaurs uncovered. 3/10 Bethany Cox",negative,movie
42743,"I've got a friend who plays on my masochistic urges. He tries to dig up the worst movies that he can because he knows I'll watch anything once. 'Leeches' was his most recent bid to break my spirit. It is pretty far from great, but it is no worse than you might expect it to be. This is actually a very good time to 'judge a book by its cover.' Everything you need or want to know is there.In fairness, the film is not trying to be anything more than a low-level exploitation film. A similarly masochistic buddy of mine watched it with me and we actually found it hilariously funny in a couple of spots. The acting is total cheeseball and the dialogue is ridiculous. The film is charged with homo-eroticism. Come on, it is just hilarious the number of shower scenes that take place, and the fact that all of the guys go into slow motion when they undress to go swimming.The leeches are pretty funny. They move very slowly ... until they attack. Then suddenly they become piranhas and move with lightening speed. The leeches also have high pitched squeaky voices. Oh yes, this is a special film.If I was going to be generous I would say you could watch this film as a satire of teen monster movies or that it is maybe a message film -- ""Steroids are BAD!"" You'll be happier if you watch it and just revel in the b-movie humour. A lot of it is unintentional and the actors all take their parts with a hilarious degree of seriousness. What little hope there might have been for this movie was spoiled by a completely random plot twist in the last moments of the movie.I was going to list a series of questions that the movie had brought up for me, like why a competitive swim team with an Olympic sized pool would need to swim in a leech infested lake. I don't really want to waste anymore time on this movie though and I hope anyone reading this is doing it pre-emptively.

42991,"The trouble with a movie becoming a blockbuster is that it gets copied and copied and copied ad nauseam. This happened with The Hunger Games and Dance to Death is one such copy. Yes, it's set in Moscow and the deadly tournament takes the form of a dancing competition, but the connection is clear: yet again we see a group of young people forced to fight each other to death, yet again two of them fall in love, yet again there is a corrupt government... Nothing we see here is new. Except for the dancing, which can hardly be called a bright new idea, as it makes the premise of the movie even more absurd.The plot is of course totally predictable for anyone who has seen even a couple dystopian movies. The big plot twist didn't surprise me at all. Political fights between the people in power are presented in quite an interesting way, but it's the only part of the plot that isn't boring, absurd, and full of highly unlikely events. Everything else is shallow and uninteresting.The acting is also pretty poor, especially when it comes to the main characters. Ivan Zhvakin as Kostya is flat and seemingly incapable of showing any emotion and Lukerya Ilyashenko as Anya is overacting pretty much all the time. The only performance I really liked is Denis Shvedov as a champion plotting to overthrow the current ruler and take the power for himself. Sadly, one good performance can't save the movie.CGI is quite good and nice to look at and the music fits the story. However, neither of these things makes Dance to Death a good movie.

43090,"Well, I had hoped for just a little bit more from this movie actually.""Parasitic"" is about some comet that hits Earth that apparently had some kind of space parasite on it (doesn't comets always have some kind of space parasite on it in movies?) and it causes a mutated parasite to fester on Val (played by Bianca Holland) while stuck inside a locked off bar. The parasite grows and takes over the host body, preying on the remaining workers trapped inside the bar.The storyline was pretty straight forward, though it had a tendency to linger on for long times without really getting anywhere, which tended to slow the movie down dramatically, where you just sat around and wanted it to pick up pace and get going. The storyline didn't bring anything new or innovating to the horror genre, so don't' expect anything revolutionary here.As for the characters in the movie, well, oh my... The characters were so rigid and stereotypical that it was painful to watch. And they were having some real questionable dialogue that was halting at best. Trapped inside a bar and people disappeared around them, then turning up dead or worse, and no one seemed to take it overly serious, nor were any coming up with any real usable plan or plausible ideas at any times.And who bars up the windows of a bar, locking up all exits securely from the inside and refuses to let employees out? That whole thing was just so unrealistic and I found it very hard to buy into that approach. But how else would they keep the people trapped in a small, confined space with the deadly space parasite? The one thing that ""Parasitic"" really had working for it, was the special effects. For a low budget movie, then they have really managed to pull off the effects quite nicely. The parasite was well designed and it looked real actually. I was thoroughly impressed with the effects in ""Parasitic"".One question came to mind when I was watching the movie. When one is sick with an upset stomach and vomiting, why would one take off the shirt and then proceed to take off the bra? That just made no sense at all, and it was a really lousy cheap trick to get some nudity into the movie. It was pointless and didn't help the movie along one bit. And this happened quite early in the movie, which pretty much put down a low bar for the expectations for the rest of the movie. Had they opted to not go for this lame approach, there would have been just a tad more believability to the movie.And why would there be no phones in the bar, aside from one apparently locked away in an office? And in this day and age, why did only one, yes one, person in the bar have a cell phone? And for some odd reason there was no proper lighting anywhere in the bar to be found, everything was shrouded in perpetual gloom and shadow.""Parasitic"" is not particularly scary, though filmed in a relatively small location, they did manage to build up a good enough sense of being trapped and a sense of claustrophobia. Just a shame that the movie didn't manage to pull off any real shocks or scary moments.What makes it worth to sit through this movie, it is the special effects on the creature, but it is hardly enough to justify spending about an hour and twenty minutes on it. If you like horror movies and want to be scared or thoroughly entertained, I wouldn't particularly recommend that ""Parasitic"" is the first of choices.Though I will say that for a low budget movie project then the overall feel of the movie (aside from the lousy characters and dialogue), then they managed to pull it off well enough, so thumbs up for that part at least.

That has to count for something, right?Tenkiller focuses on two college students (though one looks about old enough to have college aged children herself) who head out to secluded lakehouse to escape from one of their abusive boyfriends. They talk, take in some of the local color, and attract the attention of another angry man, except this one is much more dangerous.Unlike a lot of slashers, there's no mystery or whodunit aspect here. The only mystery is trying to decided what's going on in most of the night scenes (my DVD appears to be sourced from the world's oldest VHS tape).There's a slight attempt at character development with the two leads, but they never rise above dim-witted bimbo who can't leave an abusive man and sassy, no nonsense best friend cliches.If you're expecting tons of nudity or gore, you'll be disappointed, too, since Tenkiller didn't seem very interested in supplying any which leaves the film in a weird place - not thoughtful/suspenseful/scary/character driven enough for serious horror fans and not enough blood or nudity for the gore and skin fans.

American Ninja 4 walks the fine line between guilty pleasure and just plain bad. There are moments of sheer stupidity that you just can't help but love the antics. For example the movie asks us to believe that an Arab terrorist would have ninjas guarding him. Or that a gang of Mad Maxish rebels couldn't overthrow the Arab terrorist and his minions until the American Ninja (The one played by Dudikoff) arrived plus the bad guy's army actually takes the time to try and arrest what looks to be a thousand rebel soldiers armed with machine guns and axes. The most ridiculous moment arises when Dudikoff catches an arrow in his mouth which he then uses to stab a ninja in the neck with. (Take that James Bond!) American Ninja 4 does have slightly more life in it's fight sequences than American Ninja 3 but really American Ninja 4 is a sub-par effort in all respects as the action sequences while competent are filmed with lack of inspiration and imagination. Still the movie has just way too many unintentionally amusing moments which almost (but not quite) save the day. American Ninja 4 also becomes a laugh riot due to some of the dialog handled with astonishing straight faced seriousness. For example the Arab terrorist and his sidekick James Booth are excited about the nuke that fits in a briefcase, to which the Arab actually activates it and lets it tick down to 1 second which then has the biggest howl of the movie. ""It fills me with ecstasy to know that I was one minute from meeting Allah!"" However he never elaborates if he means the drug or happiness in general. When Dudikoff finally blitzes the Arab's stranglehold, the Arab runs to the helicopter which leads to another howler of dialog. ""Where we headed?"" ""MECCA!"" It was classic moments like this made me enjoy the cheese of this bad ninja movie. Also of note is that Dudikoff and Booth (The best thespians in the movie) give performances of such contempt that is also vaguely amusing. The disinterested performances are still better than any other performance in the film. My wife who is a good sport, sat through this with me and said the funniest remark.

43854,"None of the Asylum teen sex comedies are particularly good, so saying that Barely Legal is the best of them is probably not saying very much. It never does reach the atrociousness of Sex Pot and Celebrity Sex Tape and Milf and 18 Year Old Virgin weren't much better either. Barely Legal does at least have Myko Olivier, who does bring likability to the only really relateable character in the movie. It does have a decent soundtrack and is thankfully not as vulgar or intelligence-insulting as the other Asylum teen sex comedies. Nothing stands out visually though, the movie can have an over-saturated look to it and the camera work was flat-looking. I was not expecting the dialogue to be any good, it was one of the worst things about all of Asylum's teen sex comedies and has never been a strong point with The Asylum either. That doesn't excuse it being so banal, unpleasantly smutty and embarrassingly cheesy all the time, the way it's delivered too it sounds improvised and any lines so any lines meant to be funny or memorable just didn't have the impact. The comedy literally doesn't exist, and some of the attempted sexiness is enough to make anybody cringe. The story was a disaster to the extent that there was hardly any at all. What there is of it is incredibly predictable, but even worse is it feels too much of an excuse to string along lots of sights of tits, nudity and such. Everything just felt shallow and half-hearted. The characters are also swamped, with the sole exception of Eric Barely Legal is the kind of movie that doesn't let you root for them, and nothing whatsoever is done to develop it. They're just there as stereotypical ciphers. And the acting is atrocious really, the girls are hot but their acting talents certainly are not and there didn't seem to be a lot of real chemistry between them.

43890,"This movie was like watching a bad movie spawned from the ""Borderlands"" games mixed with elements blatantly stolen from the ""Resident Evil"" universe.The storyline was fairly straight forward, and anyone who have seen just a single zombie movie should be familiar with the essentials of the storyline here as well. A lone stranger ends up with a small group of survivors in the midst of a zombie apocalypse.The dialog in the movie was just horrible. It was so corny and bad, that there were times when you sit there curling your toes in disbelief.Which leads us to the characters. Wow, are you kidding me? What a bunch of generic, stereotypical and totally irrelevant characters can you manage to put into one movie? Now, I am not saying that the people acting and portraying the characters were doing bad jobs, but the characters themselves were parodies on themselves and everything in the zombie genre. It was just an atrocity to witness.The zombies, well they were your standard low budget movie zombies; shredded clothing and usually mangled faces. Yet somehow the necks, ears and hands were also spotless and never showed a sign of decay or damage. It is the classic low budget mistake to make. And sure enough, here it was. And what was going on with the hybrid mix of Nemesis and the licker creatures from ""Resident Evil"". I was ready to get up and find something else to watch when I saw these. It was just laughable.For some reason, then the blood in this movie was purple, and it always had to spray directly on the camera. It was annoying and tiring to look at, and it got old really fast. Purple blood, sure, why not...Without the risk of sounding sarcastic, wait, that is exactly what I am trying to do here, then the not-so-subtle advertising for their other movies put on display in the movie was really just fantastic.

44659,"With only his second directorial showing in feature films to date, Robert Englund (best known as Freddy Krueger) brings us 'Killer Pad': the story of three loser friends (Doug, Craig, and Brody) who take up residence in a haunted house (address: 666 Perdition Road) in Hollywood. The house is wicked. Seriously. Coyotes and portals to Hell are included in the price.The movie includes a couple small cameos (Lin Shaye and Andy Milonakis included), and features a whole host of odd characters (possessed Mexicans, S&M midgets, Joey Lawrence?). If you haven't noticed yet, and I pity you if you haven't, this is a comedy. Is it funny? Eh. There are some good one liners and stupid-funny jokes. But it's pretty much all the same sarcastic humour we've been seeing from better movies with better actors and higher production value over the past few years. I'm actually getting a little bit tired of the unattractive male-centered movies. They're fun on occasion (Knocked Up, Superbad), but they're flooding the comedy market and it only takes one like this to ruin the streak.There's plenty of hot (and not-so) women, alcohol, partying, and crude humour, but that's about as far as your interest will stretch.

There are so many sexual sight gags in it, that you'll either shake your head in disbelieve or won't be able to stop laughing. If a movie like ... ""Movie 43"" can produce laughs (arguably with better actors, at least name wise), than why should this be treated differently/worse? So it changed the lead actor from part 1, but the time difference between movies made this inevitable.To call this silly would be an understatement. The acting, if you can call it that, is bad at best, the hair and make-up feels like it's from another dimension (which almost makes it work). But there are still fans for that sort of thing out there. And while this wasn't planned as porn, it does have some nudity in it as well.",negative,movie

44783,"For a porn actress seeking to cross over to the mainstream, taking a role in a B-(or less)-movie might seem like a heaven-sent opportunity, but if your name's Sasha Grey (real name Marina Ann Hantzis), you might want to think twice about appearing in a Lee Demarbre flick.For the uninitiated, Demarbre is a Canadian film maker whose credits include the cult film Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, which was shot on a budget of $45,000.His latest offering, Smash Cut, which made its world debut at Montreal's 2009 edition of the Fantasia Film Festival, is an equally low budget nod to schlock impresario Herschell Gordon Lewis (Two Thousand Maniacs, The Wizard of Gore). While such a film would seem like a natural opportunity for someone from the adult film realm to use as a segue into the mainstream, a later production – Steven Soderbergh's ""The Girlfriend Experience"" also starring Grey - was released well before Smash Cut, making this look like her second mass market role, when, in fact, the reverse is true. All of which is too bad for Grey, who is the only member of the cast who displays anything remotely approaching acting talent.The story, such as it is, is thin, and one can suppose that Demarbre was merely looking for a vehicle for tongue-in-cheek humor and gore. A down on his luck director by the name of Able Whitman (played by veteran shock horror actor David Hess of original Last House on the Left fame), dismayed by the critical reception to his cheap films special effects, decides to use real human body parts to impart realism. His first victim turns out to be a relative of April Carson (Grey), a reporter for a local television station. With the backing of her station manager (H.G. Lewis) she sets out to infiltrate Whitman's production by responding to a casting call.None of this really matters, though, as the film's true mission is to emulate the low budget schlock of Lewis' films, which it does admirably and is about the only critical compliment I can give this film.Overall the story is poorly executed trash. In keeping with the Lewis factor, everyone involved with the exception of Grey seems to be trying to outdo each other on the bad acting scale. Lines appear to be not merely improved, but takes are used that show actors struggling on the fly to think them up.Grey, whose acting is wildly uneven, is the only cast member who shows any potential of being able to believably take on a role, whether or not this was by choice or accident, given the atrocious performances turned in by the rest of the cast, is a matter for further debate.What's unfortunate, however, is that this movie will be released after Grey's performance in Soderbergh's ""The Girlfriend Experience"", and look like a step down from a promising debut.What's not in question here is Grey's acting ability, but the projects she chooses to appear in from here on in. Some of this may not be within her control, given her ongoing career in the adult realm, but choosing to appearing a mainstream film that has all the look, feel, and production values of a porn film (minus the sex) can hardly be taken as a wise career move.",negative,movie

(That's not counting the subsequent ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" which had outstanding sound and visuals.)The sound might have been better on this latter-day Freddy film but the fun scenes where wild and memorable things happened were fewer. The special-effects were better than ever but the horror scenes just weren't that cool and memorable as some of the earlier films. I did laugh, however, at the ""hearing"" scene with the male teen cleaning his ears out and then hearing scratching nails on a chalkboard. The film needed more funny scenes like that.The young characters in here were even more profane and unlikeable than the other movies, if that's possible.

While I don't look for a heavy complicated plot in an action film, it is always helpful to have something to hold it together. The story line is very linear and predictable. In the theater I was in, the audience actually started laughing out loud at the predictability and cliché lines.

45357,"Ever since Cedric the Entertainer burst onto the scene with his critically acclaimed, scene-stealing performance in the original ""Barbershop,"" no filmmaker has quite figured out how best to harness the considerable talents of this longtime standup comic. In the years since that film was released, C the E has appeared in one monumental turkey after another, with his latest endeavor, ""Code Name: The Cleaner,"" marking what we can only hope will be a professional low point before he begins his gradual ascent back towards some degree of cinematic respectability.In what is clearly one of the lamest, dopiest and most ill-conceived spy comedies in movie history, Cedric plays an amnesia victim who wakes up in a hotel room next to a dead FBI agent and a suitcase stuffed with hundreds of thousands of dollars. Unsure of who he is - the possibilities range all the way from an undercover spy to a local janitor - or how he managed to get himself into such a predicament, the mystery man, Jake, is soon on the run from unknown forces out to nab him and the valuable computer chip it is believed he has in his possession.This is such a perfectly ridiculous piece of celluloid-wasting cinema that it is scarcely worth the time it takes to watch, let alone comment on, the movie. Suffice it to say that Cedric needs to start looking into getting himself a better agent, while his co-stars - like Lucy Liu, whose career is clearly in as much trouble as Cedric's - should begin deleting this film from their professional resumes as quickly as is humanly possible.",negative,movie
45485,"Many would argue that with part II the Species films had already reached a sufficiently abysmal quality level as to deserve to go straight to video. There was, however, too much money spent on the first sequel and too much interest in the series still left over from the 1st film for this to be an option, but with part III there are no theatrical shenanigans in sight. Species III is a direct to video mess from start to finish. It was hard enough to believe in Species II that they made a clone of Sil, but I suppose it can be believed since the scientists wanted to study her for weaknesses that could be used in case another outbreak of aliens occurred.So in the original film, Sil was created, escaped promptly and went looking for a mate. She was a vicious enemy throughout, and her pursuers were desperate to capture and kill her, knowing at least vaguely what she was capable of. In part II they make a clone and keep her in a huge glass cage, which is more like a living room surrounded by thick glass, and complete with everything from a treadmill to a television set. Dr. Baker, the lead scientist, even routinely went inside the cage with her and the two had civilized conversations. In part III there is a male scientist that seems to think that the new Eve, this time named Sara, is his daughter. He even tells her stories as he tucks her into a bed in his house.Part III starts where part II left off, with the fatally wounded Eve being transferred by military ambulance to be disposed of. I like that two low level guys are sent off alone with Eve's body, with not a single other vehicle along to make sure that the transport gets safely to its destination. Needless to say, all hell breaks loose in the form of two babies born from Eve's dead-then-alive-then-dead-again body, after which the movie has no idea where it's supposed to go. At least I assume they were both born in the ambulance, One of them was just kind of there. There is so little effort put into maintaining any linearity to the aliens in this film, since they grow and change so fast, that pretty soon you'll find yourself just accepting that there are a lot of aliens running around trying to mate, as well as lots of half breeds complicating matters further.Our hero may be the dumbest thing about the entire movie, and not by any fault of Robin Dunne, the actor who played him. It seems that Dean is working on a fission reactor, giving a tour of his team's progress at the beginning of the movie, only to rush out and arrive late to class, at which point he is scolded by his idiot professor as if he were in 3rd grade. His professor soon starts fantasizing about viruses, soon becoming furious that someone would be so inconsiderate to plan the destruction of the only remaining smallpox virus still in existence, which is kept contained for studying purposes. Not only does he almost get emotional about a virus, but when Dean points out some of the imperfections of viruses, his professor becomes furious with him once again, and then a student pushes past him outside of class, angrily calling him a ""specist."" I had no idea that viruses had interest groups.It was nice that Natasha Henstridge made a notable guest appearance at the beginning of the film, although she only served to remind the viewer that no one else but her can play the alien in a Species film. The combined alien and human DNA has once again cooked up some more staggering hotties. Not only does this genetic combination consistently cook up hot blondes, but now breast implants have been added to the blonde and a brunette is thrown in for good measure. Yes, Sunny Mabrey is nice enough to bare her plastic breasts for much of her screen time. The brunette alien, who appears in the film out of nowhere, has a quick and wildly unsexy sex scene with a gas station attendant before speeding off in her $140,000 Ferrari, leaving a skewered carcass and the rest of the gas station employees just as clueless as us in the audience.Amelia Cooke, who plays the brunette alien, does offer a shining moment of interest well into the fourth half hour of this film and after an hour and a half of slogging through a lot of pus-filled, gooey sci-fi crap. This movie is so bad and so unforgivably long, however, that even her relatively shining performance has a hard time rising above the slop in which it is mired.",negative,movie

Even before reading or hearing any body's opinion on this show I suspected it was a Dexter's Lab rip off, I mean just look at Johnny's sisters, there female versions of Dexter!

This movie actually did a good job at making you care about the characters (although other movies have done it way better) but that's about the only redeeming quality of this movie. Overall the film was very boring and EXTREMELY predictable, and very misleading for a sci-fi movie. Really it was just a watered down stereotypical alien invasion story but there wasn't even much emphasis placed on the aliens. In fact they barely show up in the movie at all.

45802,"I started with a 2, but I give it a 3 for charm and moderate innocent fun - against so much of the garbage dark and grim superhero and political garbage movies filling the theaters today, but seriously, how did this movie make it to the theaters? The Director/Writer along with the Editor should have their salaries docked for such lousy work. I mean absolute garbage efforts --- in all three - writing - directing (which allowed poor acting from taking the worst cuts - and editing -- the absolute worst. They managed to take three main-stream super star actors and nearly ruin their careers (likely not) with this VERY poorly written, VERY poorly directed and oh my gosh..

The only thing I truly liked about this movie was the colorful and sun-filled backdrop of the location it was filmed made it fun to sit through, and seeing the faces of Jones, Russo and Freeman -- three actors I who's work I have enjoyed so much over the decades, along with many supporting roles of some big names -- made it watchable.

46231,"When thinking of an 'escape' type film, the things that would generally come to mind would be intrigue, mystery, schemes and deadlocks. It is a pity then that 'Carjacked' contains none of these. In an atmosphere and complex that fluctuates from amicable chatting to sudden gun pointing for the majority of the film, the whole production, the events and the characters seem either too far fetched or too devoid of life to be believable. Usually an actress with personality, Maria Bello portrays an inherently imploded single mother struggling with life. Her character remained detached whilst her emotions were too difficult to read. The hijacker, who was really responsible for carrying the film, acted by Stephen Dorff, is not menacing and instead of a cunning bank robber, is presented as a simple petty thief, which does take away credibility, even if his demeanour is a dangerous cool. The dialogue between the two protagonists comes across as very unnatural, so much so that the movie may well have been better off without it. Whilst watching, you will likely find yourself throwing your hands in the air multiple times wondering how Bello's character Lorraine could not escape rather than find yourself absorbed in the intrigue of the plot. Dorff may well have been referring to the film as well when he refers to Lorraine as 'a whole other class of something else'. Although, he forgot to add, 'in blandness'.",negative,movie

Poorly scripted dialogs, complemented with pathetic dialog delivery, below par acting by people who have been in the industry for more than a decade now (especially Abhi and Bips), poor punches and lot of technical mistakes is what you see in the first half n hour of the movie. The only three stars that I give to the movie is because of slightly better second half where the execution of the plot was slightly better and the twist in the climax - the only original thing about the movie. The biggest difference between Italian Job and Players is the build up of the story. While the English flick detailed each and every step of the robbery and provided logical and believable reasoning for the same, Players just rushed through the execution with many steps unexplained. The story was build up very poorly with many loose ends. Is it really necessary in Bollywood to portray Hero as good? Why would thieves be good at heart? Goa police can actually sue the producers for their portrayal. After watching the movie I kept wondering if this is the same Abbas- Mustan jodi which made Baazigar, Khiladi, Aitraaz and Race?

46325,"Like many horror films back in the 1980's (and even today), The Boogeyman takes its influence from John Carpenter's landmark in horror, Halloween (1978). While Michael Myers was the physical embodiment of the 'boogeyman' legend (I say legend, but it is more a term given to whatever scares little children at night), Ulli Lommel's shockingly s**t video nasty goes the extra mile and adds a supernatural spin to the story in the shape of a haunted mirror.The quite effective opening has a young girl and boy spying on their slutty mother as she seduces a man with a stocking on his head. They are spotted, and the man ties the boy to a bed while they have sex in another room. The girl cuts him loose with a large knife, and the boy then uses it to murder the man. Years later, the boy Willy (Nicholas Love) is mute, and the girl, Lacey (Suzanna Love), is psychologically troubled by the events of her childhood. Her psychiatrist Dr. Warren (John Carradine, looking like he's hoping nobody will notice his presence in the film) advises her husband Jake (Ron James) that she should go back to her childhood home to confront her demons. She does, and while there she sees the man wearing the stocking in the bedroom mirror, which she smashes. Jake pieces together the mirror and takes it home, when strange deaths start occurring.Yes, this is as daft as it sounds. Horror movies have long made killers out of strange things (tomatoes, clowns, a house), but a mirror that influences suicides? Mmm. It's one of the strangest choices for a killer 'bad guy' I've come across in horror since the strangely likable Death Bed: The Bed That Eats (1977). If anything, this at least separates it from other mundane entries into the slasher genre, but the film struggles along trying to juggle a story a sibling connection, psychological torment, and standard stalk-and-slash. There is a half- decent death involving a 'long kiss', but apart from this, it is instantly forgettable.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",negative,movie
46484,"Dont listen to most of these reviews. The Meg is a steaming pile of hot garbage. First I want to address the Chinese influence in the room. If you like sub-par, nonsensical movies where China and Chinese things are shoehorned in as hard and as often as possible for no real reason, then this just might be the movie for you! If you want to watch several Chinese ""actors"" who cant act (Bingbing Li and Shuya Cai... God if you got used to seeing good child actors like those in Stranger Things are you in for a treat seeing this kid ""act"") in an unimpressive ""spectacle flick"" then this movie might be for you! If you're a teen or sub-teen who thinks flicks like Paranormal Activity are good, then check this bad boy out! If you're all of China, well you've probably already watched this.For real though, if you have a pulse and are not in a medically induced coma, dont waste precious brain cells on this! The Meg is an extraordinarily predictable, laughably bad (but not so bad its good) effects driven garbage movie with a pointless plot. It is the typical ""Chinese funding movie"" where you can clearly see the influence the investors had in regards to the movie. There really isnt a plot, which would have been fine if there was some character development but there is no character development either. Even the special effects were VERY meh and 2008 video game cut-scene feeling. The ""best"" thing about this movie was Jason Statham, but he had little to work with and even his acting felt... disappointed. I wouldnt say hes phoning it in, but he DEFINITELY is not giving his all. All of the other actors, including Rainn Wilson, were pretty awful. Unfortunately there are several long shot attempts for us to empathize or care about characters but when their acting is worse than a 1st grade play its hard to take seriously. And Bingbing Li... we get it, you're a pretty face who probably did a LOT to get into the position you are now but you're not a good Chinese actor and you're a tremendously terrible actor in every western film that your bf paid for you to star as. Surprisingly Shuya Cai was even worse than Bingbing, but she at least has the excuse of age on her side. There is really only one thing going on in this film: Who is the Meg gonna kill? These kills are telegraphed that these people are going to die a mile away with crappy lines that are supposed to be foreshadowing but are HORRIBLE. Then comes the main star of the show, the Meg. It acts completely unrealistically as a natural predator. You know they just wanted it to act like a movie murderer, but they have it do so many stupid things that are out of character for an apex predator of the seas. It ignores abundant food sources, stays at or near the top of the ocean, and instead of going deep into the ocean and away from shore, somehow this super shark just KNOWS that there is a nearby Chinese beach brimming, and I mean BRIMMING, with swimmers several miles away. While that sounds like a good place for a super shark to go have a nom, there are vastly better, more plentiful fish in the sea than Chinese people on a beach. How and why it makes a bee line to that beach is a mystery of bad writing. The way they 'take care' of the Meg at the end of the flick is probably one of the dumbest, lamest, so unlikely of a scenario that I let out a huge laugh. This has got to be the worst ending in a mainstream movie I've seen since I cant remember when! The whole thing was over China-fied that it almost felt like one long advertisement for China. That wouldnt have mattered if they made it part of the script for some reason but no, its Chinese for the sake of being Chinese so Chinese audiences can go OOOO CHINESE!3/10 for Statham and... well I couldnt really think of anything else. I was going to drop it to a 2 but I guess the effects bring it to a 3. However bad you might think it is, trust me its MUCH worse than that! IF!!!! you want a super dumb turn off your brain and watch pretty colors on the screen, then see if you can get through this sludge. Everyone else STAY AWAY!!!!!The worst part is that if the Chinese investors actually let filmmakers do their thing, I' sure someone could have made this unique or interesting... but its just not.",negative,movie

Following in the footsteps of City of Embar, the Host, Red Dawn, Sorceress Apprentice and many other books turned failed film. This film walks well trodden ground retelling the same old story we've heard many times before. The good looking teenage models pretending to be actors do an okay job. They all have the same expression on their face throughout but thats not really their fault. Even in the clutches of death, they feel no fear. Even with the loss of a loved one, will she not shed a tear. The script takes the world of Hellboy, the fighting from Blade, throws in the conspiracy arch from Harry Potter, the love triangle from Twilight and the incest from Star Wars and mixes it all together to give us Percy Jackson and the... Sorry, wrong film. I meant to say Mortal Instruments. The front door of the house is destroyed, and is left for days (if not weeks) with the other tenant doing nothing, the neighbours doing nothing, the burglars doing nothing nor the police. Even at the end when the main character has the ability to do something about it, she still leaves it in pieces!The betrayal of a main character means nothing as we had no knowledge of his backstory which makes me believe thirty minutes was chopped of the start of the film. Other characters just pop up when needed, making me think they had action figures to sell, rather than a use for the story.The action was okay, but there was far too much love triangle for my liking and jokes that I've heard before. We are overloaded with good shadowhunters, bad shadowhunters, demons, mundanes, vampires, werewolves, some guy that walks around at a party in underwear, witches, warlocks, The T1000 Dog, raven monsters and who knows what else. Yet while this world invites us into invisible buildings, magic tattoos, and transportation portals - at no time do you ever feel in the world of magic. It all feels very earth based. The sheer grandness of the supernatural world is just lost. The city of bones turns out to be absolutely nothing but a room and again were back on Earth. Everything takes place on the same few streets jumping back and fourth to the same locations in hope that the love triangle angle can be escalated by having one of the them walk in on the other. This film is what it is. What it needed was originality, older actors, less monsters and an actual city of bones, rather than a room. Its not the worst film by any means, but its walking well trodden ground indeed and you cannot help but think I've seen all this before Worth watching, but don't expect a masterpiece or any rewards.

The Acting: Now, its hard for me to say that ""she didn't do all that well"" when I'm not a professional actress myself, but...Lindsay Lohan (playing Ashley) didn't do all that well. She definitely overacted her part. I found her entirely fake, and she didn't seem very into the character, and she did not convince me of a single line.

The lines were completely and DISGUSTINGLY corny, and sounded horribly forced.

Cardone managed to infantilize the dialogue so that even crack-whores and NASCAR fans would still think it was pretty lame.Then Harlin added his special touch; that indefinable quality of his that perfectly demonstrates his utter lack of imagination. He turned what could have been a phenomenal battle of supernatural powers (I was hoping for the Dark Phoenix versus Emperor Palpatine on Steroids) into a schoolyard scrap involving explosive water balloons. Sadly, Ken and Ryu did it better in the original Street Fighter arcade game.Harlin dropped the final nail in the film's coffin by casting a bunch of no-talent rejects from Melrose Creek, 90666. It was probably because no self-respecting actors would have tied themselves to this sinking ship. Apparently after doling out a trifecta of trash with ""Driven"", ""Mindhunters"", and ""Exorcist: The Beginning"", Harlin was hoping to suckle from the same teet that nourished Andrew Fleming's ""The Craft"" and Aaron Spelling's ""Charmed."" Unfortunately that breast has shrivelled up and gone, and all we are left with is a boob who fancies himself a director. Pity for us.",negative,movie

47286,"I went in fairly openminded. I'm usually a fan of these Lord of the flies style films, but left very bored and disappointed. There's nothing gradual or logical in the escalation. It goes from 0 to ""were out of food and people are murdering each other"" way too early in the film. Proper context for why the people don't just leave is never given. The idea in most of these stories is that they're trapped or are given reason not to. None of that happens in this. With little interaction the characters just decide to act crazy. The lower class floors aren't even poorly treated so there's not even anything outrageous to fuel the escalation. The pieces and ideas were in plain sight, it just doesn't do a very good job of selling itself other than to be a very hipsterish artsy set piece. It doesn't help that as stated all the people are just awful without exception so you don't even care. Luke Evans is pretty great but Tom hiddleston plays a bland unlikeable wet towel and you have to watch him be yawn worthy for 2 hours. I'm not sure its his fault.

I didn't believe any of the actors because of the poor character development -- the dialog was extremely wooden, even from Cromwell, who can do much better. Sandler showed no emotion and gave the audience little reason to support of empathize with him. Rock does a good job ad-libbing through a poorly re-written script (the original screenplay by Tracy Keenan Wynn was great. He must be cringing through every minute watching this hash). I found myself for much of the movie comparing scenes, line delivery and dialog with the original. And nine times out of 10, the remake came up lacking. Sadly, Hollywood is not going to get the message we all want this poorly made film to deliver, because it will do extremely well at the box office thanks to the casting of Sandler, Nelly and the ex-jocks, bringing a built-in audience.

48309,"I'm not sure how so much could go wrong on this film. It seemed like a pretty sure thing: a book that has been very widely acclaimed and read as a work of sad life-and-death meditation from a 14 year old girl looking down or somehow from the ""in-between"", a kind of purgatory, after being raped and murdered, on her family and killer. It seems like the stuff that could make for some harrowing dramatic material... or, possibly, a sappy story. It turns out Jackson takes the latter route, but there's more than that wrong here. It's a giant miscalculation that has a few moments of real impact and where the performances match up with the material.Maybe it's just a general attitude that Jackson and his writers, wife Fran Walsh and Philippa Bowens, take from the book. What might have been poignant observations, for example, from the girl Suzie Salmon (like the fish) becomes a series of really jagged narration in the film that is a) poorly written, b) in a continuously ineffective and/or annoying tone from Saoirse Ronan (who is not bad in the film, by the way, when the material requires it), and c) it's redundant. We see her sights in this in-between world, moving about and in quick motions without consistency, though as with Avatar one might say at least it's ""pretty"", and her descriptions are at best unnecessary and at worst just stupid. It's some of the worst use of narration last year (compare it to The Informant! and see how much of a drop-off it is).But narration is just one thing. Another is a lack of focus in the story, and actually getting to really care about any one of the living characters. It's not really the actors fault, as Wahlberg, Weisz and Imperioli do what they can in their roles (Wahlberg especially, in spite of everything, throws himself into the devastated father well). When it comes time for us to really get into the emotional grit and horror of this situation, of how horrible it really is, it's actually glossed over by Suzie's situation up in the in-between. There isn't a solid 'conflict' about who the killer is since it's revealed in the first few minutes of the film. On top of this the logic on Stanley Tucci's character is all-too obvious - it's a perfectly creepy performance, but a little subtlety might have helped. And then there's the lush grandmother played by Susan Sarandon that is used for very ill-timed and unfunny comic relief midway through the movie, after which she's pushed aside to a reactionary role.And yet I didn't have as big a problem like some critics have had, which is with the in-between itself and its visual scheme. While it's not as imaginative as Jackson seems to think it is, it does reflect, more or less, what a 14 year old girl's emotional state would be in an afterlife world. It's more-so a problem when Jackson deals with balancing this fantasy afterworld with the real one, and the rules of how Suzie reaches out to those is never firmly established (the one girl she brushes against running down the street is one thing, her parents and sister are another). It's not so much the sights but, again, a mood and attitude that Jackson botches: what is with this Asian girl that accompanies Suzie? It's explained, to be sure, as are the other victims of Tucci's child killer, but the attachment she has with her previous life and family is screwy, it becomes muddled and unsatisfying.I would almost stop short... no, I would just about claim that this is close to being the kind of cloying, sappy crap that one would usually find its way onto Lifetime, where struggles are put to melodramatic limits, and by the end every plot strand, no matter how unlikely, is resolved (one of those, involving Rachel Weisz's character, is just ridiculous in its timing). And yet for all of the story and character problems, for all the clunky dialog, Jackson has a few moments where he can let his actors have room to breathe. Chief of these are scenes involving suspense, when Suzie is in the lair of the man who will kill her, which is a gradual scene of weird intensity, and then later a scene where Tucci comes into his house while Suzie's sister is snooping around. Little glimmers of the kind of filmmaker one saw from fifteen years ago on another movie about teenage girls and the fragility of life and death and love, Heavenly Creatures, in such real dramatic clarity and power. But that's all really.The Lovely Bones has so much that could go right with it that it's most disappointing how wrong it goes. It takes someone with as much talent and passion as Jackson to screw up on this level. He and his writers have not made an exactly boring movie, but it could very well be for some in the audience. I found myself shaking my head and frowning at what I saw, a watered down vision of reconciling grief and loss, and at best a mixed-bag of a story surrounding a not-whodunit about a child killer. Some may be moved, and more power to them. I couldn't wait for this wishy-washy journey to end.",negative,movie

This movie is really predictable. Once you see the setup to the scene you can basically figure out the whole scene. The characters were more annoying and the plot was presented in an unfunny scene. The only source of comedy was racism and low brow humor. They just reused fat jokes. The new cast member was annoying and no one really developed as a character. The movie tried too hard to be funny and it failed to be funny. I was bored for that movie. The problem was resolved because they're the protagonists even though the Bella's weren't good enough. The rest of the people in the theater were young Tweens and they were the only ones laughing and enjoying it. I'm only 15 and I didn't enjoy it.

48573,"Maybe it's just me, but when I hear about an Oliver Stone directed football movie starring none other than Al Pacino I'm expecting a masterpiece. That's why I was quite taken aback by how much of a turd Any Given Sunday is. It's the story of fictional NFL team the Miami Sharks. Al Pacino is the team's head coach who is trying to desperately to take them to the playoffs, but to do so he must battle against unnecessary roughness on and off the field. Dennis Quaid plays the teams star quarterback who, after a nasty hit, is put out of the game and replaced by Jamie Foxx who somehow becomes a superstar after winning just two games, because that's how the NFL works, right? Turmoil continually befalls the team as they try to keep it together so they can go all the way and have the season of a lifetime.What I love about Oliver Stone is the way he can take something we've seen plenty of times before and make it into something highly original and absolutely brilliant. He changed the face of war movies with his robust shout out to the troops in Platoon. He took a rock and roll biopic and turned it into an existential masterpiece with The Doors. He allowed the presidential biopic to soar to new heights with JFK. So his attempt at a football movie should have been revolutionary. But instead we are given this sappy, cheesy, poorly written, poorly directed stinker of a film. What the hell happened? Any Given Sunday is just one big melting pot of clichés. There is absolutely nothing original here for a football film. You might not realize it, but you know the entire plot of the film before you ever hit play. I'm not sure that this film get any more obvious. It is the complete package of typical football film story lines. You have the tormented coach who can't keep his team together. The all-star quarterback who gets injured, letting the far superior rookie play. Said rookie is an egomaniac who can't get his life together because of the excess of fame. But of course a few inspirational speeches from coach and the whole team is golden once again. The flat lining lack of originality in this film is appalling.However, what's even more appalling is Oliver Stone's god awful direction. This film is so sporadic and lacks any kind of structure to its editing. We are constantly barraged by quick cuts that do nothing but distract and quickly become very annoying. The look of this film is supposed to seem fun and artistic, but really it is just pretentious. Stone is trying to do something talented with the direction here, but it doesn't work at all and only gets in the way. There is hardly a shot in this film that lasts for more than 30 seconds. The camera will be focused on one person as they deliver a monologue, but the camera constantly changes angle on them, jumping from spot to spot on their face which gets ridiculously annoying. Stone has displayed such finesse and such raw talent for direction in the past. I really don't know what happened here.Any Given Sunday is easily one of the biggest wastes of close to three hours of my life. It's a truly terrible film that lacks any kind of control, structure, meaning, or purpose. Al Pacino does a nice job while the rest of the cast are pretty sorry. A football film from Oliver Stone should stand out amongst all other football films, but instead this film just takes every football film cliché and applies that to itself, never raising the bar of originality. The only reason this film would stand out amongst others like is would be because it is so horrible. I never thought I'd say this about an Oliver Stone film but... I hate this film.",negative,movie

49254,"After seeing The Aviator, I disagree with the majority of people, who seem to adore the film. Its director, Martin Scorsese, is no doubt one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, but he has stumbled again with this film (following Gangs of New York).The film's begins by showing one puzzling scene of Howard Hughes' as a child being bathed by his mother and then it jumps to a scene showing Hughes as a young man directing a movie, Hell's Angels. This 'jumping' from scene to scene with little or no explanation happens quite often in The Aviator and I think it may have been necessary to keep the running time below 10-hours. Aside from Leo and Cate Blanchet, many other characters in the movie are introduced with subtitles or never introduced to the audience at all. It seems Scorsese thought anyone besides Hughes and Hepburn are not worth the director's efforts. The movie SEEMS to contain many interesting subplots: Hughes' interest in Hollywood movie-making, relationships with Katherine Hepburn, Eva Gardner, etc., his quest to build the fastest planes, battling PAN AM and corrupted politicians, building a corporate empire (dream), and fighting the inner demons, which eventually destroy's his life. However, none of the plots are explained with any interest and the story skims only the plots' surface with no effort to grab the attention of the audience (at least not mine).If an audience is not familiar with the life and times of Howard Hughes, Katherine Hepburn, Eva Gardner, and the evolution of commercial airlines in the U.S., then it is almost impossible to see any depth in this movie.Sure, the set designs and acting of Leo and Blanchet are above-par in the film, but most others aspects of this film are in such a mess! It seems as if Martin Scorsese (and the writer) assumed every audience coming to theaters to watch The Aviator would already be fascinated by Howard Hughes' eccentric life. The story in the movie has no beginning or and no ending! It starts abruptly and ends abruptly.Although the film spends nearly three hours concentrated solely on Howard Hughes' success and his inner demons of life, I walked out of the theater with a feeling that I've just watched an expensively designed movie with no real content. It really is a shame to spend that much money to make a movie that long only to miss the mark completely. Howard Hughes' life story must be very interesting to have drawn so much money and top talents, but then why is The Aviator so flat and boring? Well, it's simply a not well-made movie.I miss the RAGING BULL, GOOD FELLAS, CASINO, CAPE FEAR... and I wish Mr. Scorsese would go back to making highly entertaining movies with DeNiro. THE AVIATOR (and GANGS OF NEW YORK) is a sub-par quality by the director's great standard.",negative,movie
49411,"The consensus seems to be amongst contributors here that RocknRolla is a 'return to form' for Guy Ritchie. I should point out at this point that I don't accept the premise that he had ever struck vein of 'form' in the first place. He did to some extent (and not necessarily to his credit) create a distinctive genre of British film with Smoking Barrels and Snatch and, in the sense that this is almost identical to those earlier films, RocknRolla it is certainly a return to something.I'm a Londoner; my parents were Cockney and my grand-parents were Cockney (in fact my Auntie Elsie lived only a few streets away from Violet Kray), and as such I have always thought of Ritchie's Mockney gangster genre as the rather sad fantasy of a bored and insecure middle-class public schoolboy sitting in his 'dorm' reading ""A Profession of Violence"" and wishing that Mad Frankie Fraser was his dad and that Frankie would turn up in the senior common room one day and give a good slapping to all those rotten school bullies.I've never found any of Ritchie's films funny and I certainly didn't laugh at RocknRolla. It's juvenile, has a silly plot and is too long as well. The characterisation is poor and the dialogue is annoying and dotted with the kind of toe-curling phony philosophising that would probably not even make it into a Kabala recruiting video.Ritchie is a director of some technical skill but his limited imagination and interest in the human world at large means that he will never make a film outside this Mockney Gangster genre (Swept Away showed us the disaster that ensues when he tries). The fans are there for the Mockneys and I'm sure he'll continue to make more at ever lengthening intervals, probably with decreasing budgets and eventually going straight to DVD.

49873,"I find that before shelling out cash for a flick at the video store or down the local cinema, its usually a good idea to check IMDb for the overall rating given. Up until i saw this film this system seemed foolproof...before i go on, i'd like to say that i enjoy films from all over the world, and am a fan of Asian films, so no bias there. There were three main problems i had with this film, firstly the concept was good but the implementation was flawed, secondly a lot of the supporting characters did not seem to make a positive contribution to the film, and last, the ending was just plain awful (""a nice neat happy ending"" TM). For some reason this film reminded me more of a cheesy Indian film than the usual Hongkong style flicks. It just oozed cheese all the way throughout mixed with some mild drama and instantly forgettable sequences. not sure why it got such a high rating here, maybe people feel that just because there are a lot of good hongkong films, then they all must be good, or maybe they are just being fanboys and ignoring the boredom induced coma you have to pull yourself out off when you realise the film is over. i definitely would not recommend people buying/renting it but if you see it on cable its passable.",negative,movie
49934,"Stefan, the main character, is shallow lacking any significant qualities other than being a shy computer nerd.
The surrounding characters are equally as shallow. They are uninteresting and static. I suppose this is all in service of the obvious gimmick at play here - it's hard to create an in depth story when it's essentially a stripped down adventure game.
From the first ten minutes, before the decisions became significant at all, it was incredibly clear what the eventual outcome of the plot would be. Black Mirror is often intentionally on the nose to prove a point, but usually it manages to pull it off with a strong narrative and interesting characters. This has neither, and as a result the message behind the scenes feels clunky and mismanaged. This episode shows it's hand right out of the gate, self referencing everything fans of Black Mirror will recognize. It does so with the subtlety of a wrecking ball through a home.
The constant stops and resets of the plot drained any interest I had in the possibility of discovering multiple story paths. Just when I was starting to get engaged in the story everything would grind to a halt and remind me that I'm watching an interactive video and not a world I can fully immerse myself in.
As a result, the film feels entirely disjointed, like a rough edit where the editor somehow forgot significant scenes that tie the narrative together.The narrative remains unsatisfying by never quite landing on its feet, while the interactive portion becomes tedious after the second or third course correction.",negative,movie

Lacking a good enough slant for a powerful dramatic depiction, the writer latched on to this gimmick to propel the story to a wider audience. While we can be grateful for an opportunity to hear this great music and thrill to the recreation of some of the period settings, we cannot be happy about this distorted approach to biography. Nor can we feel elated over the decision to make the character of Mozart a cackling, show-off buffoon.

Maybe it was the dull tones, or maybe it was simply an odd choice of medium for a movie about such subject matter. The beginning half, even though dark and gloomy, seemed whimsical and funny in a strange sort of way. As the story went along it became more lifeless and uninteresting, and as Mary grew up she became even more of a psycho than our deranged friend Max.

Either a horribly aged once-perfect-looking Tyrone Power (with a gorgeous trophy in the wings played by Ruta Lee, pictured twice): he's accused of killing a rich old lady befriended for need of a loan on an egg-beating invention, or the title character in Marlene Dietrich, who gives the best performance overall, especially having to do with a twist that really only works in repose...Meanwhile, the always great acting team of Charles Laughton, as the flawed defense consul of the English Court, and real life wife-beard Elsa Lanchester, are only pretty good here, going back and forth more like another kind of stage play.

I didn't see any really believable character interactions. In fact, sometimes they seemed to be bored with each other. I thought it was funny how some woman committed a major crime but she was still walking around loose and frankly doing anything she wanted and I mean ANYTHING. I gave it four episodes worth to get better, but it dragged on and on. They never seemed to let up on how everybody else is stupid but the main character is so overblown smart, so overblown wonderful. If they had been smart, they'd have given him an actual personality, given him scars, which he seemed to lack, at least in the first four episodes. I can't believe there are so many stellar reviews of this bland show.",negative,movie

Even the terrific Jodi Comer can't save this disaster",negative,movie

This series is attempting to catch the supposed ""struggling"" family of the current era, but it fails to do so big time. Regardless of the child with autism, the rebellious daughter, or father with bad financial choices, the show is just too trite and pretentious for me. I don't find anyone in the series convincing, most of all the child with autism. Unless people are watching this out of boredom, I can't see this series lasting another year. The content and actors are dry.",negative,movie
50911,"I had high hopes for this celebrated. Golden Age ""screwball"" comedy, what with the casting of Powell and Lombard, not to mention the more than adequate support and high production values, but I was sadly disappointed. A combination of morality tale, treatise on the dignity of man and comedy of manners, it strives so hard for the Capra or Sturges touch but frankly misses by miles.It starts well enough after a superb ""city lights"" title sequence, then with the opening encounter at a Hooverville camp of two socialite sisters Carole Lombard and Gail Patrick encountering ""forgotten man"" Powell, but too soon he's morphed into the perfect butler and somehow stolen the heart of younger sister Lombard and gained the enmity of her snooty older sister Patrick. I know that screwball comedies often have fantastic plots but this is all too much to swallow in one sitting. None of the cast are in the least likable or sympathetic, with the arguable exception of the always watchable Eugene Palette as the long-suffering family patriarch. This is the first time I've seen a film starring Ms Lombard and have to say I was far from impressed. She overacts terribly and has the volume button set to 11 throughout. Powell seems far too old for her and there appears little spark between them (weird considering they used to be married) and I failed to perceive his charm to all and sundry. As usual he gets to do a seen-it-before tipsy scene and otherwise seems to play throughout in the one key. Then we're meant to believe that him dousing her in the shower to cure her hangover is a sign of true love. To top it off there's a hanger-on of the mother's, her protégé, if you will, who gets to act like a gorilla and eat like a pig. Very strange.No, I was left cold and unamused by this would-be uplifting farce and thought about how much better Hawks or the afore-mentioned Capra or Sturges would have handled this.",negative,movie

Sets and production design is amazing.
Otherwise the whole plot is boring... it's a terrible event but it's actually a boring story.

Breaking bad had a steady beat to it starting off slow and then cranking up the story lines. Saul is a wise man in Breaking Bad but Jimmy seems to be utterly clueless. The scene were Jimmy was in Los Pollos Hermanos was the lowest point of the series to date. What on earth have the writers done to this show?

The story is unremarkable and nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before. The acting isn't great but isn't completely horrible, however the special effects - of which there are a good deal - are laughable at best. In fact, if you can read this sentence, chances are better than 50% that you could do a more credible job creating the video explosion and compositing effects in this movie than the filmmakers.The movie's saving grace - if you're in the mood for a grade Z turkey of a film - is that there's always something happening and it never gets boring.

You can tell that this is all ab lib without a script, but I feel the acting troop needs some lessons in improv.I notice that the angles in the movie are impossible. The movie has one film crew made up of two people, yet they are capable of getting these victims from every angle and capture different people in different rooms all at once. This would not matter at all if the people they were capturing were interesting to watch. It sucked so bad I needed other things to focus on.It feels like a group of kids got together and made a Zombie movie for fun based on an interesting premise.

Mercifully, it's not the same plot, but all of the outer edges are the same despite having such a dull blade to begin with.I guess the main plot is SUPPOSED to be about two evil Tucker & Dales who use an ambulance to prey on innocent victim victims...of car crashes, but is turned into some not-so-teen drama straight outta I Know What You Did Last Summer. Actually, make that: it's more like the parody of that movie from within Scary Movie.In truth, there are about 28 flashbacks making up a good half of the runtime from both the killers driving the Old 37 (the ambulance's name, I believe, who knows?) and ""teen's"" POV and those made my mind wander so much, I have no real idea what this mess is about.But, hey, when is it NOT great to have horror screen legends: Bill Moseley and Kane Hodder in front of the camera and very nice gore graphics? Also, no-spoilers, but I LOVED the very end. To be honest, it didn't fit the scene before, but it still was a pretty good final shot. (And the scene before, I totally got the reference, Mr. Hodder. I sure did.)But, no amount of a Masked Hodder, a Bored Bill, gore and a great finale will save this all-over-the-place horror film.

It's a very bad movie, of course, but the ""so bad it's good"" factor is huge on this one. I'm glad I didn't smoke pot before watching this because death by laughter would surely be the result.I won't even try to describe any of the scenes, but rest assured, each one stands on its own as a testament on how not to make a movie. This isn't Casablanca, people.Now, on to the merits of this film: 1. This is the very best Mexican wrestler Vs. vampire movie I've ever seen (although it should be noted, it's also the ONLY one, so I guess that makes it the worst too).2. It features some extremely good looking Mexican women, which is definitely NOT a bad thing. However, no explanation is given about how one of the vampire women, who was awakened after 200 years, came across her horn-rimmed glasses. (I detected the distinct odor of ""Producer's Daughter"".)3. I saw the English dubbed version and the dubbing wasn't that bad.All in all, it will depend on your mood whether or not to watch this.

Unfortunately this wasn't the case which has left me with a very unsatisfied feeling. You do get a good introduction into the world of Midnight, but when you feel the story is just about to take off the ending credits start playing. I just hope the makers of this movie see the actual potential of the story and decide that they have made a pilot after all and not a film that has to carry its own weight.

52042,"When a fracking environmental accident rips apart the earth's crust, the resulting hole lets out prehistoric sharks from underground. The sharks target a group of women and trap them in a cabin.So, what is there to be said about this film? Jim Wynorski filmed in Florida, primarily because of the need for a cave, but also because his investors were Florida-based Cubans. He brought along actress Amy Holt, who has worked with Wynorski a few times, and included Traci Lords, who went mainstream thanks to Wynorski. Lords gives possibly her worst performance ever, and is cast in a role that really has nothing to do with the primary story.I was not expecting much going into this film. I knew it was made-for-TV, and I've seen enough of Wynorski's work to know that his best years are long, long behind him. I had a little bit of hope because Tony Randel was attached as an editor and producer, and his name still carries weight. Randel brought along his daughter, Sofia Randel, who designed the main title sequence. That was canceled out by Traci Lords, who is grossly overrated and still somehow skirting by on her notoriety.As cheesy as the CGI might be, allegedly it had even worse CGI the first time around and they had to call a second company in to redo it. Even the second company seemed to have a problem with continuity -- ground displaced by sharks in one moment is back in place the next. There were also legal complications, thanks to a meth-smoking production assistant. Never mind some of the plot nonsense, like the forced romantic moments and the so-called ""first edition"" of Charles Dickens' ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (which adds nothing to the story).The film has a few nods or homages, such as to ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". Also, Wynorski has always loved ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" and wanted to remake it. He has said a script was written, but Roger Corman ""didn't want to do it -- he thinks too much of the original film to do a remake."" Wynorski was able to sneak in a reference or two to ""Crab Monsters"" here.The best anyone can hope for with these sorts of movies is that they are so bad they cross back over into good again, because we can laugh at how stupid they are. I'm afraid to say this one never crosses over. It tries, and the Asian jokes are funny... but it seems to expect to be carried by trashy women with big breasts. I suppose for some people that's all you need.Wynorski's next film, ""Cobragator"", was also filmed in the same Florida town, though financially backed by different producers. So look forward to seeing some of the same sets when that hits your screen in the summer of 2016.",negative,movie
52080,"SOLAR ATTACK is an extremely dull would-be disaster movie starring everyone's favourite low-rent action hero, Mark Dacascos. In it, solar flares threaten Earth and the usual team of scientists and government types have to team up to discover a way to combat the impending doom.Unfortunately this is dry and stilted beyond belief, with no attempts made at realism. They don't try to engage the viewer's attention once. The actual disaster elements are limited to a couple of scenes of burning fireballs striking a handful of American cities but such moments, despite being entertaining, are few and far between leading to lots of inactivity and dull dialogue.Cast-wise, Dacascos is the dashing hero but unforgivably doesn't even get the opportunity to kick any martial arts ass - he has one fight scene which is over in approximately two seconds! Elsewhere we get a tired-looking Louis Gossett Jr. playing the US President, and lots of to-ing and fro-ing on board a Russian sub during the supposedly thrilling climax, which is about as thrilling as me cutting my toenails.

Nevertheless, if you are interested in Greek cinema, and just want to pass some time, you can still watch it. Just don't expect belly laughs or a desire to share it with your friends.It's in essence just the story of a small town ""get rich quick""-kind of guy who finds himself in the middle of some wild schemes involving the maffia, a beautiful, but manipulative stranger, and his doppelganger. It manages to be ludicrous, but without the proper structure of french farce. If you're looking for a Greek comedy that is genuinely amusing, I suggest ""Nisos"".",negative,movie

Four fine actresses on a 'Dangerous liaisons' type of film but somehow in the process everything witty and entertaining contained in this great novel of the 15h century was lost in translation.The film gives no clue whatsoever if the tales being told have anything to do with some army in particular in some period of history or with the lord of the rings saga..(Hint: the turks are the orks, and Tirant resembles Aragorn, though no Virgo Mortensen in sight just a lookalike).

53054,"After the first few minutes of re-watching this film, I thought I'd been a bit harsh on it. It looked great, had a really excellent opening scene, and seemed to have all the Fulci trademarks out there loud and proud. Then those damn kids turned up and the whole film turned into a pile of crap.One night, two people arrive at their house after a night out, talking complete boll*cks about this and that, and discussing their children, wherever they are at the time. After getting themselves geared up for a bit of filthy squeezy, they discover the world's worst burglar, who proceeds to smash the guy's brains out and do a bit of good old eyeball removal on the lady (just like Ghosthouse and Killing Birds), then for good measure, he smashes in the guy's face with a poker. He then wraps the corpses in sheets, chucks them in a car, chucks the car over a cliff, then burns the sheets. So far, so Italian horror film.We then switch to the funeral, where Auntie and Uncle (don't ask me to remember their names) are in attendance with the recently orphaned kids, and I'm no doctor but these two kids are seriously bi-polar. One minute they're crying their eyes out, and the next they're laughing their arses off at the priest getting a fly on his nose. Also, Lino Salemme (Demons, Delerium) shows up as Guido the caretaker, looking pretty guilty.So off we go back to the house, with Aunt and Uncle, and Auntie doesn't like the house one bit. For starters, there's all sorts of creepy crap going on in the attic, and the kids aren't acting too sane either. They invite a real estate agent over to value the house, whom the kids call Mr Sausage. He's trying to walk up a flight of stairs when the ghosts of Mum and Dad cause him to fall, which makes the kids bust a guy laughing, even after Auntie tells them off.They kids also start to creep out Guido, who starts hallucinating bloody sheets everywhere, which gives us an extended version of what happened at the start of the film (probably also to give us some gore, which this film is sorely lacking). Of course, Guido was the murderer at the start (and that's no spoiler as we kind of know this anyway) and the ghosts drive him insane and to his death.For some reason (and ""For Some Reason"" would make a great alternative title for this film) Fulci decides to do this in the middle of the film, which leaves us with roughly forty five minutes of film left with these two kids and their parents. The parents, by the way, periodically turn up as crappy, giggling flames that dance around the place while the son wants them to come back from the moon while crying his eyes out before laughing his ass off. Jesus.Aunt, like the audience by this point, has had enough of this crap and wants out of the house, so we get another scene of grievous bodily harm being enacted on Mr Sausage while the kids roll about on the floor laughing. The parents also turn up as ghosts so now you get some cheeseball smooshy family stuff with the family (and dog! The family dog comes back too for some reason!) running around laughing and talking in Conquest-style reverbed voices while Aunt and Uncle arrange for an exorcist to show up.Also For Some Reason, some glowing rocks appear outside of the house. The exorcist tries his best to rid the ghosts of the house and then Mr Sausage turns up with a bulldozer and then it goes haywire and then the exorcist picks up one of those rocks and then his hand melts and then the kids crack up and then the film ends and then Fulci's ghost comes out of your television like Ring and batters you around the head with a baseball bat before pointing and laughing at you for three hours.I've watched nineteen Fulci films from Lizard in a woman's skin up until Demonia and this is by far the worst. In addition, I've recently been watching every Italian horror I can get my hands on from 1985 up until the industry died a death roughly around the mid nineties, and this is the worst of them too! Sometimes I think something gets lost in translation with these films, but here I have no idea what Fulci was aiming for with this one – It's like a horror comedy with extreme gore that is neither scary or funny. Or makes any sense. Looks good though. Next up: Ratman!",negative,movie

53094,"What can be said about THE NIGHTMARE NEVER ENDS? Well, it's NOT a quality film. Everything about it is bad: acting, dialogue, script, cast, cinematography, etc, are all way below average. It's a truly wretched film of cataclysmic proportions. For instance, take the dialogue: Cameron Mitchell says at one point, ""I see swastikas swimming in my oatmeal!' which had me rolling on the floor. It's my new all time favorite line of dialogue. In another scene, a vigilante sorts named Papini wants the Nazi war criminal killed. He's been stalking a doctor (played by Faith Clift) and wants her to kill the criminal. One day, Papini storms in her office without her permission and asks her why she didn't kill him when she had the chance. So how does she answer? ""I'm a doctor, I cannot kill."" That's it. No anger or anything. It's priceless. Faith Clift is the worst actress of all time. With that being said, the film is totally unforgettable, not just because it's so wonderfully bad but because there are some truly effective moments in it. Yes, even with its staggeringly inept quality there are several moments that elicit real horror or shock. More so than any horror film made these days. The state of horror films today is truly sad when a disaster like this is more effective than 90% of all horrors films made today.The effective moments come out of nowhere: when someone takes his shoe off...didn't expect that! A nightmare inducing scene; the nightmare sequences are so bizarre and weirdly shot that they're oddly effective; the discotheque is...eh, weird. It makes me more uncomfortable than anything else in the film; the actor who plays the Nazi war criminal is just weird; and last but not least the ending which has to be seen to be believed. My jaw was on the floor.Needless to say even with those effective moments the film is still crap. Well worth watching if you're a fan of obscure horror flicks or ""so bad it's good"" movies.

53098,"""The Nightmare Gallery"" came without as much as a fanfare, and it will leave without as much as a whisper. I hadn't heard anything about this movie prior to finding it one year after it was initially released. I was lured in by the movie's cover/poster, because it seemed rather interesting.And I was even more intrigued when I noticed that the Rand family lived on Innsmouth Ave., so I thought maybe I was going to be in for some Lovecraftian inspired horror. Instead, I suffered through one hour and six minutes of sheer self-inflicted torture by watching this movie, as I should have given up after thirty minutes. But I thought the movie would pick up and become interesting. I just never did. And I didn't even finish the movie, having about thirty minutes left or so, and having no intention of returning to finish it.Why? Well, because the storyline was tedious and utter rubbish, to be bluntly honest. It made no sense and it seemed more like the work of several directors whom had no collaboration and were told to direct individual segments with the same character, then piece it together afterwards. The script was just boring and all over the place. So not a great accomplishment by writers Jhan Harp and Rob Stith.Director Gene Blalock didn't really have much to work with, and it was definitely reflected on the screen.The characters in the movie were fairly adequate, they were not overly interesting, but served the story well enough. And while not being in the lead role, then it was actually Mieko Hillman (playing Dawn Rand) whom carried the movie with her performance.I have no idea what this was supposed to be, but an hour and six minutes of nothing happening was not my sense of entertainment. And with no interest in the remaining thirty minutes ""The Nightmare Gallery"" was exactly what the name is; a nightmare gallery.There is nothing I could or would recommend in this movie, so it is not worth the effort.",negative,movie

It is what it is and even if some had a lot of fun with the original (which was filmed/released a long time ago), I doubt many were yearning for a sequel.But that's how things work and if a title sounds familiar, investors are there and some people will watch it (guilty as charged, but I do watch almost anything as you can tell by my list of reviews ;o) ).

53349,"Actual rating 3.3/10 mainly due to the ability of cast: Katherine Isabelle, Christopher Lloyd, Michael Ironsides and a special mention to director April Mullen.First, the movie is a cliché of the Hollywood (Canadawood) B cinema of girl goes gun crazy for revenge. Exploitation films usually run it after a rape or family violence but in this case it's boyfriend revenge. At least so we think. So it draws comparison with the superior Kill Bill. But it lacks the style and coordination of Kill Bill. In many ways, it tries to be Memento, also another superior film, but it is far more disjointed with too many cuts, parallel time(?!) and flashbacks which only makes the film confusing and nonsensical. It's also disjointed in its treatment of its own title 88. The first 20-30 minutes it does build on it. So there's some interest. And someone pointed out 88 has a significance with Christopher Nolan's Back to the Future. Which adds to the interest. But somewhere in the middle, the film is confused and forgets about its own title. So why 88? It actually means very little after a bit of number play in the first 20 minutes.It's like if you ever meet someone or have a friend who's had a drug or mental issue. Someone who experiments on drugs. They never make sense. And the experiment goes bad. I'm not sure how other reviewers give it a higher rating (or how did it get a 4.5/10 here, which tells you, it definitely can't be a good film). But keep in mind, often lesser films on IMDb get high ratings due to the limited reviewers being probably connected to the film (e.g, friends, employees) or strong fans. After a few hundred reviews or with time and loss of enthusiasm, it often goes down in ratings. (So why do I review it? I like reviewing both good and bad films. No real reason in particular but if I have time and the film strikes me in a way, in this case, Isabelle, Nolan and how they can be in a poor film).Our heroine Katherine Isabelle plays Gwen, Gwenny or Flamingo. That is, yes, she doesn't have a clear identity or fugue state as the movie opens. One thing is for the main character to have a fugue state but the whole film is a fugue state. A woman who kills several people accidentally or intentionally? Are we supposed to sympathize with our character? Trying to draw into the character and making the film imitate the character doesn't accomplish much. Imagine The Hobbit being a short film on a small screen because the main characters are dwarfs and hobbits. And the men in this movie either get killed, kill themselves or die trying to protect her. It seems she had a violent past int he end but she never showed on police records although her associates (e.g, Cyrus) did. I'm not sure why what's so special about her, that people try to protect her. Basically the film is trash like the sets as someone inquired where was this film so badly shot? It's like trash like its trashy characters. I almost never say that for any film but it's a rare film, maybe a 1 in 40 or 50 films. Yes, that bad but not the worst. 90% of my films I rate are 4/10 and above on IMDb. Nothing special about directing (rather poor), screenplay, cinematography, all substandard.Just hardly worth watching, except for the somewhat good, curious casting: Christopher Nolan emerges from his Back to the Future to play a aged hood, Michael Ironsides always plays the cliché cop (or villain), and Katharine Isabelle gives a very good performance. She was terrific in American Mary, which is an underrated film on IMDb at 6.3. I would give it more a 7.0/10 if you can stand the gore and appreciate the originality. 88 tries to emulate that originality of character but falls very short. Special mention to April Mullen who plays Lemmy, a far more interesting character than as the director of this movie. It's a short cameo role as the gun dealer Lemmy who has a bizarre but funny flip sign in her abode/store. Probably the best moment of the film.Without the cast, it would be a 2 or 2.5/10 or bottom 1 out of every 200-300 films. Just really, really bad without the main characters. But you may want to tolerate this film if you have nothing else to do but see what Katherine Isabelle or Christopher Nolan can do. But I think they themselves would rather not see this film on their own resume. It is that forgettable and straight to netflix.",negative,movie
53485,"Sort of like a comic book superhero version of How America Won Its Independence, ""Beyond the Mask"" features Andrew Cheney as a British assassin named William Reynolds who goes to the colonies to help wage war against the Empire, as a means of demonstrating to his true love (Kara Killmer) that, despite his checkered past, he's really just a decent guy under it all. While in the new world, he becomes a masked figure known as The Highwayman, who rides around at night securing victories for the fledgling rebels while hiding his identity behind a black mask. And, yes, it's every bit as dopey as it sounds.

Its portrayal of the personalities and events of the time is laughable at best, with a plot to blow up Philadelphia using Benjamin Franklin's own idea for electricity against him serving as the climactic stupidity. Luckily, Mr. Reynolds, scoundrel that he is, is on hand to thwart the dastardly deed with his heroism and his purity of heart. And that, dear children, is how the Americans came to win their independence from England.In more gifted hands, ""Beyond the Mask"" might have been a fun, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink kind of lark, a harmless little bit of absurd revisionism designed to make history entertaining for the masses. But, sad to say, everything about the movie - from the script to the directing to the acting - is so terrible that there's actually precious little fun to be had.",negative,movie
53596,"I had just high hopes for The Monster Project, I watched the trailer and sat in awe thinking of the potential the movie had and was overjoyed when I found myself with the opportunity to finally watch it.The concept is fantastic, a documentary film crew going to a ""Haunted location"" to interview three volunteers who claim to be monsters. We have a supposed vampire, demonically possessed girl and skinwalker and as you can imagine it all goes wrong when they turn out to be real.The movie starts off okay, introducing the characters and introducing our ""Monsters"" but as soon as anything actually happens it spirals out of control fast.What I mean by that is it goes from a great idea to yet another found footage mess. Lots of screaming, lots of shaky cam, lots of predictable jump scares, lots of running away and the obligatory nightvision.The concept goes out the window and the generic clichéd mess appears and that just broke my heart.

I only wish my 6th sense had been working and told me not to waste my time watching it. only got to the end by playing games on my computer at the same time. as it had subtitles I had to keep looking for a while but soon there wasn't much dialogue and all I could hear was Monica Belluci gasping and panting as she struggled to survive a series of shocks and physical feats that would have put Bruce WIllis under a lot of pressure. Catherine Deneuve must have had a laugh making some of the scenes and had a frozen blank for most of it ( trying not to giggle perhaps)? The camera concentrates on close ups of Monicas face a lot too and as she appears to be in shock and gasping for air for a large part of the film it becomes very annoying. Yes there are a few spots that keep you watching for the special effects and but mostly these sort of scenes have been in many other films. If you get to the end well done!,negative,movie
53971,"Director Jake West, who burst into the horror film lexicon quite nicely with the far above average vampire film ""Razor Blade Smile"", hits a minor stumbling block with this second sequel to the original Pumpkinhead. Quite wisely pretending that the previous ""Blood Wings"" travesty never existed, this film is much more akin to the first. (practically a remake in parts). This automatically makes it much better then the supremely awful previous film. A dubious honor indeed, but hey you take what you can get. Doug Bradley (Pinhead from the Hellraiser franchise) is a doctor harvesting organs in a small town, but when the locals find this out three of them visit the old lady to resurrect Pumpkinhead for another bout of vengeance. Lance Henriksen, in need of a quick buck it seems,is back as a completely unnecessary Ed Harley (here in cameo ghost form). Perhaps the fact that it's a TV movie hamstrung it, but Pumphin Head looked like a bastardized version of the legendary Stan Winston's work on the creature. Some of the CGI elements are plain laughably bad (Pumpkinhead scaling a church immediately comes to mind as it was so awful). Furthermore the Old Lady's make-up was off as well, the plot didn't deviate from the original enough to warrant this being made other than money. But as I said it IS better then part 2. And I'd be an idiot to write off West merely because of one clunker of a made for TV sequel, the kid still has talent and I look forward to his next project. I just believe that Pumpkinhead (just as ""Children of the corn"", and ""Lawnmower Man"") should've never been a franchise and the original spoke well enough for itself and should have been left well enough alone.My Grade: D",negative,movie
54164,"The structure and intelligence-level of this hopeless little gem is so dumb it almost becomes legendary. Here we have God and Satan themselves sitting in train, discussing whether a few bizarre characters belong in hell or in heaven. This aspect provides the film with the most bizarre wraparound story ever used in a horror anthology. You could say it's very original and creative (and in a way, it IS) but, due to the amateurish and silly style used here, it becomes unintentionally hilarious and pathetic. But you can't really claim that the creators of Night Train haven't got a sense of humorGod is credited as himself' and a guy named as Lu Cifer supposedly plays Satan. Hahahahaha nice try! The separate stories surely have potential! Which isn't that surprising because they're actually edited from full-length movies! Completely ignored 80's quickies like `Death wish Club' and `Cataclysm' that never received any recognition. Especially the first two short stories are enjoyable (and very gore) but the final episode more or less ruins  the whole film. That last one is twice as long (or at least, it felt like it was) and it's utterly boring and uninspired. Try to look at this film as a perfect example of bad acting and  most of all  as a filthy piece of 80's trash! The make-up and shlock effects are truly nasty and gruesome (we see people getting slashed their heads off and sliced apart with a bone saw) and the creature-effects (like the beetle in `Death Wish Club) give a whole new meaning to the word `cheese-fest'.

The direction is notably appalling, with so many scenes shot into the sun so that the whole frame is filled with glare and you can't see the actors, and the action is bad even by B-movie standards; there's not one moment of excitement here.Lundgren proves a strong physical presence as always but his character is underwritten as are the rest. Nan Yu as the female lead/love interest comes off the best and it's interesting to note her appearance here after she later teamed up with the star in THE EXPENDABLES 2.

55291,"Sonny (Jeremy Ray Taylor) and his friend Sam (Caleel Harris) discover R.L. Stine's forgotten first novel whilst undertaking some house clearance work in their neighbourhood. Unlocking the book releases Slappy, the psychokinetic ventriloquist dummy who though initial seeming benevolent has an evil plan to overthrow the town. The first ""Goosebumps"" movie, from a couple of years ago, is far better than it has any right to be. Despite its relatively thin premise, it was very well written and had a good young cast that had chemistry together. Unfortunately the follow up is very much from the ""straight to video"" school of sequels, even if it's managed to land a cinematic release. The cast quite simply are not as good and in the first one, nobody is glaringly terrible, but there's little spark between them to make me actually believe in any of the relationships. The supporting cast feels a little bewildered too, Chris Parnell and Ken Jeong, try and wring something from characters that don't have enough to do to make much of an impact. But it's the script and story that really let the film down. A facsimile of the original film, the plot is designed for all the characters to return form the first, even though most of them have little part to play, apart from wandering around in the background of a scene. The dialogue though is exceptionally poor, clunky exposition and (especially when Slappy arrives) the worst collection of puns this side of ""Batman And Robin"". It is, at times, physically painful to sit through. The effects are decent though and it looks generally pretty good as the Halloween decorations comes to life. It was a bit much for some of the younger children in my particular screening, but generally the film is no scarier than your average Halloween display.

Virtually every character is a fake. The German Brigade Commander is shown perpetually attended by lackeys who wash and shave him. His forces spend the entire film attempting to take a building in which a half dozen Russians are holed up with a young girl that none of them rapes. Meanwhile the German company commander spends most of his time attempting to woo a Russian girl who eventually, of course, he rapes. Instead of blowing the whole building up with tank guns these valiant Germans led by fools perpetually storm the building in their hundreds only to be shot down and blown to pieces by grenades cleverly thrown by the handful of Russians inside it. Women stand at doorways in a sniper zone just to say goodbye. The Russians perform Italian operatic arias instead of Russian folk songs whilst stupid Germans always lose their lives by endlessly pausing before pulling the trigger. But worse of all the script reads like a Stalinist message about the heroic struggle of the people against a ruthless maniac German machine that would enslave them for a thousand years. The real importance of Stalingrad as a symbol essential to win for both sides is never explained. And the ruthless sacrifice by the Soviet leadership of millions of their own people is never mentioned.

55349,"I felt extremely tired watching this clumsy, poorly-executed movie. Until I checked, I thought it must have been made by a first-time director. From the very first scenes it felt so forced, so artificial ...The actors do what they can to save a self-conscious, witless script. Ultimately, they fail. There are some monologue scenes in the first half where the camera moves and editing are so frenetic and the direction so nonsensical that I was thrown completely out of the story. The story, which is only barely there to begin with. Editor Nick Moore was doing okay back in the days when he was assisting great editors like Michael Kahn, but here he's drawing way too much attention to himself without helping the film. It's not actually his fault, to be fair. Nothing could salvage this picture.There are no twists. What we suspect in the first 5 minutes turns out to be exactly right in the end. Meanwhile, there's a lot of struggling around with heavy, obvious plot devices. There are scenes -- including the scene from which the film gets its name -- that go absolutely nowhere and turn out not to have anything to do with anything. There are some turgid nods toward race-relations issues ...But is there a film here? Sadly, no -- not really a film, more like an overly-long TV cop drama that I might watch if I had a bad case of insomnia. Nothing falls together, nothing really works.This is a film almost totally lacking in subtlety of purpose. We don't believe a single thing that happens on the screen. It is, in short, an awkward B-picture with a budget large enough to hire actors with talent. Talent that is sadly wasted here by poor direction and over-the-top, uneven writing by Richard Price, who seems to specialize in barely-watchable pulp crime melodramas, of which this is definitely one. The IMDb trivia listings for the director, Joe Roth, say he is ""Ranked #6 in Premiere's 2003 annual Hollywood Power List.""

55451,"I've been on an Altman kick lately. He was a very interesting filmmaker whose output is split pretty evenly between wonderful successes and crashing-bore failures that are at least interesting in a train wreck kind of way. Very few of his films fall in the middle ground between these two. Unfortunately, ""Pret a Porter"" (Ready to Wear) is one of those very few. This film has the same inter-cut multi-story structure as the classic ""Nashville"" and the underrated ""A Wedding,"" but none of the anarchic madness or depth of those earlier films. But it's also not a spectacular ""what the hell were they thinking"" failure like ""Quintet,"" ""Popeye,"" or ""OC & Stiggs."" ""Pret"" falls squarely in the middle ground. And the result is a film that is almost too boring to watch. There's just nothing special here--the story isn't special, the style in which the story is told isn't special, the cinematography is straight and bland, the sense of reality and improvisation is missing, and the signature Altman overlapping dialog is nowhere to be heard. It's like Altman wrote the script and then handed it over to Chris Columbus to direct. Like I said before, I wanted to like it.

55661,"Gene Hackman does everything but shout ""I want to live!' in this indictment of the death penalty, of the gas chamber, of hatred and bigotry, of loyalty to disreputable people, of grandstanding politicians and judges, of family shame and secrets...the list goes on and on. Film begins with a 1967 hate-crime down south attributed to a Klansman, charged with the bomb blast that killed two Jewish boys and maimed their father. Fast-forward 30 years: that Klansman, now aged and set to be executed in the Mississippi State Penitentiary in 28 days, is represented on appeal by the grandson he's never met, a young but not incompetent attorney who figures he's his grandfather's only hope. (Family loyalty gets the green light here, though the reasoning behind the kid's pursuit of this case is tenuous at best. Fans of novelist John Grisham may say ""the young man's motivation is clear, to heal family wounds and to mitigate his secret shame,"" but that only works for a book jacket; on the screen, with N-words exploding and hate-speech spewing out of the one lively character, it's another matter.) When Chris O'Donnell is at the jail, being led down hallways and through locked doors to meet racist, grizzled old Gene Hackman--sharper and saltier than the other Death Row inmates we see--one is apt to get ""Silence of the Lambs"" déjà vu. Indeed, Hackman is a vile cuss who distrusts everybody, but as the drama unfolds--wherein the attorney and his grandfather learn to work together--one has to wonder if this is meant to be the heart of the material or is there something else lying in wait to surprise us. Are we supposed to be sympathetic towards Hackman's poisonous, hate-filled Sam Cayhall just because he's revealed to have a conscience deep down? Or that he didn't work alone? William Goldman and Chris Reese (a pseudonym for Phil Alden Robinson) adapted Grisham's book, and I'm guessing they weren't clear on how much redemption Sam Cayhall should be shown. It's a movie full of muddled logic, nondescript performances (save for Hackman and an overacting Faye Dunaway as Hackman's daughter) and credibility issues right from the get-go. *1/2 from ****",negative,movie

55937,"The knock on 1980s movies is that they sacrifice substance for style, leaning too hard on whiz-bang visuals and MTV video aesthetics at the expense of character and story. Like every such generalization, it's not strictly true, but you would be excused thinking otherwise after watching this 1984 crime drama.Terry Brogan (Jeff Bridges) is a pro football player suddenly cut from the Los Angeles Outlaws on bogus terms. Sleazy gambling buddy Jake Wise (James Woods) offers him some needed funds in exchange for Terry finding a mysterious woman who stabbed Jake, stole his money, and fled to the Mayan ruins of Mexico. When Brogan discovers this woman, Jessie, looks exactly like Rachel Ward in her gravity-defying heyday, he decides on a new plan involving much sex and tequila. Naturally, things get crazy, setting in motion murder, heartbreak, and an emotive Phil Collins ballad.Based loosely on the classic noir firm ""Out Of The Past"", ""Against All Odds"" is best known today for the Phil Collins tune. It's a classy song that emotes a lot but doesn't overstay its welcome. At two hours, you can't say the same of the film.When we first see Terry, he's walking around Mexico showing an old photo of Jessie to random passersby. This shouldn't work, except of course its a movie. Bridges looks great with a lean build, a tan, shades, and a beard that makes him look like a cross between Dan Fouts and Kenny Rogers. He has good chemistry with Woods, here debuting his hard-guy-in-a-suit who would brighten many a film over the next two decades.Director Taylor Hackford gets the visual elements right, but the story feels as lost as Terry in his opening scene, especially when it is complicated by a L.A. real estate venture and Jake's gambling activities. More than most '80s films, the plot seems to do little more than whisk the characters from one exotic locale to another.The ""Out Of The Past"" connection works only to the detriment of this film, as the plot of the Robert Mitchum film followed a more straightforward path, and gave us a central female figure in Jane Greer who is one of the great femme fatales in cinema. Ward, by contrast, is painfully unsteady as she wears her heart way too far out on her sleeve.""Can't anyone love me without it being life or death?"" she cries out, a line she delivers so badly you wince from watching it. Judging Ward's acting skills is unfair, given the fact she must spout lines like this with painful regularity.Alex Karras as Terry's trainer is just as awful as Ward, and not nearly as much fun to look at, showing up out of nowhere in the middle of Terry and Jessie's most heated lovemaking session to up the ante on the film's unbelievability quotient.I enjoy its aesthetic, very ""Miami Vice"" with more earth tones and good musical segues. Hackford is always terrific at that, anyway. The sex scenes got a lot of attention in 1984, though they are actually subtle by today's standards. Ward and Bridges sure can kiss at any rate, which helps keep dialogue to a minimum.""I wish I'd seen you play football,"" she says.""I could see how Jake would go crazy without you,"" he replies.Dumb characters are at the heart of a successful film noir, but the passion that usually guides them to their doom feels tacked on here. As an ambiance bath, ""Against All Odds"" has something going for it, in Bridges' lazy effectiveness as a romantic foil and Woods' nicely underplayed menace. But even the noirish darkness of the last scenes can't conceal the weaknesses of this overstudied, underbaked time capsule.",negative,movie
56025,"I'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director Eduardo Sanchez, who helmed the wildly popular and successful Blair Witch Project. Besides, this is an alien movie of sorts, and sounded something like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that the critics hated, but I enjoyed.But nope, unfortunately I felt that for the most parts, Altered is a waste of time, so I shall keep this review short. Premises are always promising, and Altered's no different. It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff. Stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices, so I shall not go into details, but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable, and something you'd like to forget.What if you're given a chance for revenge? That is, you manage to successfully hunt down, and capture one alive. What will you do? For this group, it's a gleeful payback time, or so they thought. And this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest, with bad, uninspiring dialogue, and even worse acting. Even if it's low budgeted, there aren't many redeeming factors, be it strength of storyline, or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting. It's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script, coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed.What's good though is the makeup. Much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which I shan't mention, because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable. Other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before.Watch this only as a last resort.

In the previous picture the villain, a T-Rex named sharptooth generated real threat and was always a haunting presence in your mind. Here the two villains are simply clowns and about as scary as Littlefoot himself. The gang are just as endearing during this outing, but the themes are simply not strong enough this time to sufficiently care about them. The animation seems a little more amateurish this time round but it takes close inspection to tell the difference. There are also, unlike the original a selection of songs though none of them are memoroble,in fact some are just plain irritating To conclude the film is what you would expect from a direct to video release, not worth bothering with.",negative,movie
56520,"I did not enjoy this , what i'm gonna critique about the movie should be essentials , the story is so vague and badly written , the movie becomes so confusing at so many moments , the score of the movie was very badly used , that would put thrilling symphonys in non action packed parts of the movie , overall it was a flop for me , I didn't care about any of that characters . The only good thing I will say is that the fight scenes ar mildly good , and I was impressed by the gunshot scenes , very well handled",negative,movie
56571,"Gosh I hated this movie, I have no idea why Russel Crowe took on a role in this movie playing a obsessed detective. The movie is just not engaging what so ever, I nearly fell asleep multiple times while watching this, my brother who was watching this with me left mid way through it cause nothing freaking happens. And to top it off, it sort of justifies and adds sympathy to murderers with mental issues. Everything about the plot is drawn out and there isn't anything psychologically thrilling about it, despite what the DVD cover may say, also nothing is deep about it either. So it's uninteresting, boring, and tedious film and the only selling point about it is Russel Crowe but he couldn't save this film either and it just tries to be deep, but just isn't.3.5/10",negative,movie
56612,"There is nothing I can add in describing the overall tackiness of this classic cinematic disaster, though like all great disasters it has an almost hypnotic appeal. Common sense says you should just turn away when it comes on television, but you just can't stop watching. It's like binge eating: you know its bad for you, but one taste leads to another. It's addictive, which is somehow appropriate for the film's theme. I write this having just watched AMC's ""Backstory"" special on the making of the film and just knowing that Patty Duke can now look back and laugh at the film and even enjoy it's cult appeal kinda makes all seem okay.",negative,movie
56664,"In my ten years of IMDb activity, I have never come across a movie with such laughably fake 'reviews'. I perfectly understand how tastes vary and that one person's hidden gem can be another's stinking turd. But 'Hollow' is, by any objective criteria, pure garbage. The favorable reviews posted here can not possibly be genuine. The movie could have been enjoyably average: a mildly interesting idea squeezed into the found-footage formula of ""The Blair Witch Project"". It's problem lies squarely with its characters. In real life, panicky people annoy me. You know the type I mean: blubbering and hyperventilating and getting all mindlessly hysterical. I just want to slap them and tell them to grow a spine. My annoyance becomes outright anger when such people are made the protagonists of a movie. And don't tell me it's ""realism"": millions of people the world over deal with crazy s**t every year without curling up in a ball and begging for death. Every character in ""Hollow"" runs around screaming and crying, whining and bickering, doing absolutely nothing to help themselves or each other. Every one of them is unbelievably selfish and displays the intelligence of a mildly retarded pre-schooler. They're just so pathetic it's impossible to feel any sympathy, still less empathy. I'm at a loss to understand why movies are made about such people. Why am I supposed to care what happens to them? Why should I bother watching? Complete waste of time: very tough to sit through.",negative,movie
56665,"I just finished watching this movie and I am not going to spend time writing a very thorough review.To review this movie in one sentence, it would have been - We have seen it all before. This is a very typical 'horror' movie and if you have seen many budget horror movies before, this movie will feel very familiar. What makes this one worse than average is that it does not really have any thing special. It is an extremely bland movie. I can imagine that this movie was thrown together very quickly. Honestly, it even feels as if was made up on the spot.It starts pretty okay actually, well, not bad anyway. But even from the beginning everything feels very familiar. It is your regular intro/start of a horror movie. But when the movie tries to scare you, it is not scary at all. Every situation feels prolix. In horror movies you are suppose to get scared when you least expect it. In Hollow, you end up asking the movie to please, scare me already! It is the very opposite of what a horror movie should be.I actually had to look up what year this was produced. I would understand if it was right after The Blair Witch Project, when pretty much the found footage genre was new. There was not much to learn from back then. But this is from 2011(!). There are tons of great found footage horror movies released when Hollow was made. Tons of movies to get inspiration from. The overall 'horror level' in this movie could be explained as bland in lack for better words.Movies I would recommend instead of this one is Them/Ils (2006), or even Chernobyl Diaries (2012). Many don't even like the latter, but compared to Hollow, it is the most hectic action movie you can find.",negative,movie
56781,"This film achieves one thing very well; it is an expose on narcissism while being completely unaware of it. It's so ironic it's good and awful at the same time. The only likable character in the entire movie is Andrew, Beth's fiancée, and his role is quite marginal. The rest of the characters are completely self involved and overly dramatic. The heroine, whom I'm sure was meant to be endearing and enthralling, but is neither, is an ""artist"" who is evidently inspired by the most important thing in her life; herself. Every work of art she creates is a rendition of some ""monumental"" moment in her life. I hated this movie because of each characters' self aggrandizement but I loved this movie because I believe it is a pretty accurate depiction of the prolonged adolescent youths of modern day LA. It would be one thing to overtly address/discuss the narcissistic tendencies of each character but some of the ""message,"" which is so so subtle would have been lost. If the movie had acknowledged the blatant theme of narcissism I may have had more sympathy for the characters (which I would prefer to do when watching a film) but it was never acknowledged, it was presented as acceptable, normal, even admirable behaviour and for that reason I couldn't stand any of the characters. No punchline was funny, no pain was potent, no fear, disappointment or happiness was empathetic. They were all just unlike-able people. I'm sure it was never the intention of the director, writer or actors to name and identify the overriding theme of the film. They were all, most likely, completely oblivious to the subject matter of the film and that's what makes it so perfect. If they knew what they were doing I give them major props for being so true to the nature of narcissism and hiding the theme so plainly in sight. Besides enjoying the unintentional subject matter this movie was terrible, boring, bromidic and cliché.",negative,movie
56948,"I recently went to see this ""dog"" of a movie and I found it to be very slow moving and even boring at times. I guess when you see the trailer for this film you are expecting a little romantic comedy, when actually the film is about obsession with a tiny little bit of romance thrown in. Being that this film was from the writer of School of Rock, Chuck & Buck and The Good Girl, (all three excellent films within themselves), you would expect Year of the Dog to follow suit. Problem is, it doesn't. The last film Mike White did was the horrid Nacho Libre, so he may be starting his downward trend of making bad Hollywood films. Molly Shannon on the other hand was brilliant. She tries very hard to breathe life into her poorly written and confused character Peggy. It's to bad that Hollywood hasn't embraced her talents instead of wasting them. If you do want to see this film, wait till it comes to the Dollar movie house or try and get it on a two for one rental at your local video rental store.",negative,movie
57060,"Danzig.I feel a certain way about this movie and it's a weird feeling. I think it's a feeling of being seen. For some reason, despite the 777 bad reviews at the time of posting this review... I am in love.This movie is actually amazing. The set design is phenomenal, the lighting is sensational and the framing is beautiful. I'm not lying. If you froze any frame of this movie you could use it as a photo.I know the above sounds sarcastic but I'm actually being genuine. To prove I'm sincere, here are the flaws:The sound editing was often distracting, you could hear EVERYTHING.
The script was so bad it made be laugh but I guess that's also good.
The painfully long scenes with the same thing happening over and over made me want to gouge my eyes out.However, the biggest regret I have after watching this movie is that I only rented it and didn't buy it.

57622,"A young man kills a young woman for no reason. The man's brother is jailed on charges that he was an accomplice, but soon escapes. Upon escaping, the seemingly innocent man kidnaps three victims and soon he ropes his girlfriend in on the plot. If this isn't bad enough, the situation quickly makes a downward spiral.This film had some good aspects and many bad ones. Its strongest aspect was lead actress Emily Haack. Setting aside the fact she's nude in a fair amount of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character. I see no reason she cannot take this experience and somehow turn it into a career in some way. I was convinced she was a ruthless individual.Also, the makers of this film were very bold and pulled no punches. Graphic nudity (both male and female), coprophagia, and extreme anal violence are not shied away from. I like my horror films to push the boundaries a little bit, and this one ignored them altogether, gladly skipping towards Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they achieved what they were looking for.But now the negative aspects. First, and most noticeable, this film is very low budget and the film quality shows this. I can excuse that -- the plot was decent, the acting fine and in some scenes the lower quality film actually made the movie more disturbing (a more realistic feel). So, I won't scold them for having low-grade equipment. What I will scold them for is the use of poor choices in shots. For no reason I can ascertain (besides plumping the movie), there is a large amount of footage of a cemetery. I don't really know why, and I frankly started dozing off at this point because it was so long and pointless.I also take issue with the title. The idea here was to deceive people into thinking this film had some connection to the classic ""I Spit on Your Grave"". Now, there is a line that seems to imply the main character is the daughter of the woman from this other film. And the themes are very loosely the same (a woman getting revenge on men). But there is no firm connection and the reason this title was chosen was for the video store customer to think they were getting a sequel. This was deceptive and dishonest.My last major complaint is that this plot makes no real sense. Not even a little bit. A woman is killed in the beginning for no reason. A prison escapee finds time to kidnap people to torture them, for no reason (because they wronged his girlfriend?). The same man goes from good to very evil without explanation. Likewise, the female lead (Haack) turns fro ma normal person to someone who is overly cruel and sadistic, for no reason at all, and against people who for the most part were only marginally mean to her (a neighbor offering drugs for sex is wrong, but by no means worth getting tortured for).Don't let this title fool you, or the claims that the film is incredibly shocking. Yes, some scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the film is dull and makes you want to take a nap. If you see this in the video store or on Netflix, just keep browsing. Or rent it, and we can sit around and vent about it for hours. You have been warned.",negative,movie
57635,"The murders in this schlocky, mistitled movie seem merely peripheral to the real action, which is all the singing, dancing, flirting, and fighting at a local teen hangout. It is hardly surprising, then, that the filmmakers include a songwriter of two tunes featured in the adolescent action. Though the settings are realistic--since actual locations were utilized--no one succeeded in finding a competent director or cast. Bill Bloom, however, as Jimmy, somehow struggles through the mire of an inane script to show some skills as an actor. Most of the players range from wooden to overwrought, so that the movie does emerge with some worth as an unintentional farce.",negative,movie

57972,"By now you should already know about this film, the Jessica Simpson ""bomb"" that pretty much went straight to video (limited, anemic theatrical run). Basically, Ms. Simpson's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise him, only to find him in bed with another woman. She is stranded, but has one friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I wish we saw more often in film), who lets her stay. Katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co-workers (Penelope Ann Miller and the always amusing Andy Dick) who are just using Katie to get the president of the firm (Larry Miller) ousted. This is strictly a b movie, its not meant to be profound. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means, but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying. The film is watchable in that its not an abomination, but its throwaway fluff. In a cameo, Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle in-joke about Milwaukee made me chuckle), and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (don't read too much into this). So, not horrible, but easy to skip. Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does. Again, not good, but not a profound disaster.",negative,movie

Sun worshippers of varying ages are being done in by some mysterious creature from the sea (in this case, Long Island Sound). The monster was created by radioactive waste. In short order, there are two monsters and eventually many. A kindly old scientist races against time to figure out how to kill the critters, which are you basic men in rubber suits. The monsters are so slow-moving, it's amazing they manage to catch anybody. In one scene, a woman runs directly into the arms of one of them, and it still has trouble holding her. Badly acted by what appears to be some New York-based actors and lots of extras, and it's not the least bit scary. The fun part is to observe the early '60s hairdos and outfits. Some of the guys sport tiny, tight bathing shorts and wiggle and gyrate like they are participating in a gay parade. The girls' bikinis for the most part appear to be bra tops and diapers. A Beach Boys-type group wails its way through a half-dozen terrible songs throughout. As for the monsters, they have googly eyes and what appears to be a bunch of Hummel hot dogs wedged in their large, perpetually open moths, the better to drink human blood, I guess.

Corey Feldman is not funny and his character is actually annoying. Vanessa Angel is histrionic with her exaggerated performance. Danielle Keaton is sweet and Silvia Suvadova is reasonable.

58450,"There is one rule in movie watching that seems to always...and I mean ALWAYS...be spot on. That rule is as follows: if you see Tony Todd's name in the title, you're about to be seriously underwhelmed. I can only think of one instance where this deviates and that was the movie Hatchet, however he was in it for all of 20 seconds hence his name was not in the opening credits and was therefore not in violation of the rule. Anyway, enough about that...moving on.While The Graves isn't horrible, it's certainly middle of the road in pretty much every way. On the upside it's got Bill Moseley (who can do anything from big budget flicks to the lowest of low budget crap) and the phenomenally hot Clare Grant. On the downside, well, just about everything else. This is one of those movies that's not exactly unoriginal but still fails to be the least bit engaging for roughly 95% of the time. The film just doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be. It starts off veering towards a backwoods stalk-and-slash type of movie and then ends up in kooky religious cult territory. Either way, I wasn't exactly involved in the story. I guess if you're up for a movie with a bit of cheese (or happen to be somewhat drunk) this might appeal to you.

A spaceship tracking a signal has to go into a wormhole, when disaster strikes. The ship is torn apart and the surviving crew is stranded on the alien planet, having to fight for their very lives to stay alive, against hostile humans and monstrous humanoids.The storyline was essentially adequate, albeit a bit too simple. And there was a bit too much focus on Danielle Chuchran's athletic skills for running and rock-climbing.The creatures in the movie were looking more like a crossbreed between the orcs and trolls of ""Lord of the Rings"", which just made the movie seem like a half-hearted attempt at a Sci-Fi movie. And while we are speaking of ""Lord of the Rings"", the scenes with Danielle Chuchran running around the barren rocky landscape with a panning camera flying around was just too much like the scene where Legolas was running around. At least do something original...The reason for me sitting down to watch the movie was Danielle Chuchran and Kevin Sorbo. And sure, they made the movie watchable and endurable, but they were struggling hard with an almost non-existing script and storyline.""Survivor"" is a below average Sci-Fi movie, and if you are in for an evening of Sci-Fi, then I would suggest that you find something else, because this movie is not really worth it.A mere 4 out of 10 stars to ""Survivor"".",negative,movie

The characters have nothing to them and the plot jumps about with little sense or reason.Sometimes when a movie has shallow characters and directionless writing it is at least saved by big original or daring in what it is trying to portray, not here. Instead we are given a generic plot and a bunch of clichés, just jumbled up so it doesn't even make a standard horror movie. It is boring and yet confused at the same time, I'm not even sure how that is possible!Overall I can't recommend this movie, it's not like it's even 'so bad it's good', it's just bad because it has no real entertainment value and very little to say for itself. You would not be missing out to watch most any other low budget horror movie instead of this, seriously.",negative,movie

58746,"Boy, I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid. So naturally, I almost remembered nothing of it. Except for the fact that it somehow left a strange impression on me, and a dormant urge to some day revisit it. That urge awakened recently when I found this obscure gem on an old ex-rental tape, so this was my chance to re-watch it. As to be expected, this is by no means a 'good' movie. Far from, probably. But it still remains a curious and strange gem.A mummy gets dug up in King Tut's tomb and transferred to an American University. A student finds 5 diamonds hidden in the sarcophagus and steals them. The next day, the mummy is gone too. I'll just stop describing the story now. But if you want to know how a mummy, ancient diamonds, green dust that turns into flesh-devouring fungus, a blue-skinned alien with big black eyes and a college campus tie in all together, then you might want to consider watching TIME WALKER. But be warned, most people might generally classify this as a bad movie, and I don't even have much arguments to compete with that. The acting is just tolerable and the directing isn't top notch either. What had me chuckling most, were many inserted reaction shots of certain actors, just standing there looking for a second, not saying anything, or just giving a short stupid reply. But here's an interesting contradiction: Not much really happens in this movie, but still there's a lot going on (just remember the previous things I mentioned). Everything ties in together nicely, but it's all very predictable. The mummy prowling the campus provides a couple of nice and creepy shots, but his green-colored POV vision was a bit cheesy. Of course he kills a couple of people (not just randomly, I might add), but the kills themselves aren't much to write home about. On the other hand, the murderous mummy encounters a topless female student on one of his escapades and most of his kills are filmed in shocking slow-motion. The movie builds up towards a nice twist-conclusion too, but sadly when you know the tagline to this movie, or just take a glimpse at the front or back cover art, you already know what's going to happen. Also, the story severely lacks a climax at the end.TIME WALKER tries really hard, remains an offbeat, weird gem, but in the end doesn't succeed in what it sets out to do. There's plenty of interesting elements, but they are rigged together in a below average sci-fi/horror flick with a conclusion that leaves a lot to be desired. Given the nostalgia feelings I treasure for this one, it is with grief I have to flunk this baby. But don't let that discourage you to check it out if you should ever stumble upon it.

I did think it slightly strange that for a film where the protagonists were going to be slutty teenagers it starts on board a ship in the present day Persian Gulf . Within 20 minutes I started thinking there was a blooper somewhere and looked up the film roles of Lance Henriksen and Gary Stretch because this almost certainly wasn't the film that the Horror Channel claimed they were broadcasting .. And it wasn't , it was a 2008 film called BLACK OPSI'll watch NAZI DAWN whenever it gets broadcast and compare it to this one and in the meantime wonder if it might be better than this one which is a dark horror thriller . When I say "" dark "" I don't mean it has a gloomy downbeat atmosphere I mean someone has failed to pay the electricity bill which means it's almost impossible to see what is going on so you just have to concentrate on the dialogue which isn't up to much . By concentrating on what is being said you do notice something very unlikely and that is Henriksen and Stretch play characters of father and son . What's unlikely about this you ask ? Absolutely nothing except Henriksen talks with a heavy American accent and Stretch talks with a broad English accent . If you are expecting an explanation for this your hopes are raised when father character starts mentioning his wife and family and you expect him to say he sent his son off to public school in England but this goes totally unresolved and the story continues as the audience wander around in the dark on a visual and narrative level in this generic and muddled horror thriller",negative,movie

Does it work, in some ways yes, there are some boobs in it, but it doesn't go any further (the 1978 was XXX). Is it frightening, no, it's one for the teenagers out there who's eyes will fall open by the boobs shown. We never see the monster, just some dildo kind one coming out of the girls mouth. The only out of space thing you will have is an alien's hand. The alien itself makes some kind of web but what we have is faces and people in those web, easy to see that the web was made of some snow spray for Christmas decoration.

The guy killed is the brother of our anti""hero"", Trey, who of course isn't so bad after all. Then there is a twist involving the FBI cop, but if you couldn't see it coming a mile away, then this is your first movie.There were many outrageous stunts in this. OK, I could get past two guys jumping a ramp onto a moving train and then driving through the train cars. And racing through a bunch of trees without getting killed. And I can even get past the ridiculous fight on motorcycles between the two girls. But the last 15 minutes where it looked like a video game was too much. It was so silly, them saying this bike could go over 200 mph, and then he does it through crowded city streets. Someone would be dead in seconds from running into something.But, I must give props to Martin Henderson. He was very hot and I never heard of him before. Hopefully, he'll get more mainstream movie roles because I sure don't mind looking at him for a couple of hours.FINAL VERDICT: If you like movies with ridiculous stunts, then this one is for you.

59620,"There's an unwritten rule in horror cinema that says: you know you're in trouble once they stop numbering the sequels to originally successful genre classics. This is the seventh installment in the Hellraiser franchise and yet they already stopped giving them numbers since ""Hellraiser (4): Bloodline"". And can you guess where exactly it started to go wrong with the series?? Oh well...the good thing about these Hellraiser movies is that, no matter how mediocre the stories are, there are always some remotely interesting elements in them to satisfy horror lovers. In this seventh entry those elements are the presence of Kari Wuhrer, some sinister settings and really a lot of gore. Wuhrer stars as a chain-smoking, hard ass journalist who's sent to Bukarest to investigate the bloody rites of an underground cult. The leader seems to have a talent to bring recently deceased persons back to life and he promises his followers a world of pleasure once they returned from death. What he really looks for, however, is the one person who's able to open the mysterious puzzle box in his possession. As you can guess, our female journalist is that chosen person and she'll have to fight both the leader of the cult and Pinhead; the ruler of hell. The actual plot of ""Deader"" definitely shows potential, but it's confusing and it tries to be overly intelligent. Pinhead's share in the story is limited, as it already was in the previous two sequels, and he seems dragged into it simply because it wouldn't sell otherwise. The sequences inside the Romanian subway-trains are nice to look at and there's a lot of gruesome butchering going on. Kari Wuhrer is a talented and beautiful actress but she starred in too many dire, straight-to-video horror productions already. Apart from this failure, she also appeared in two sequels of ""The Prophecy"", a turkey called ""Final Examination"" and in the belated sequel to ""The Hitcher"". Even the bigger productions she starred in recently (""King of the Ants"", ""Eight Legged Freaks"") were disappointments.

Not at all Oscar-worthy performances, but not really Razzie material, either. There is some decent gore in the few scenes that it actually happens, but that's really all the movie has going for it. The games don't even have the philosophical weight or complexity to them like the Saw movies. It's worth a watch and it's mercifully short, 80 minutes.",negative,movie
59661,"Leslie Nielsen was always at his best when he could hook up with the ""Airplane""/""Naked Gun""-team, which consisted of gifted writers like Pat Proft, Jim Abrahams and the Zucker brothers. ""Repossessed"" is written and directed by the guy who made ""Meatballs 4"". That should probably give you a fair idea of what this movie is like, though it does feature less Corey Feldman water-skiing than expected. Somewhat surprisingly there are some jokes in here that work (the bible vending machine ruled), but overall this just really feels like everyone's trying way, way too hard. Especially the visual gags have that bothersome ""laugh, damn it!"" feel to them, they're so close to ""Naked Gun"" but just not quite. Same goes for the obligatory breakings of the fourth wall, not bad but not really focused enough to generate big laughs. Nielsen's talents are rather wasted here, though I must say he is about the only element that made me keep watching. It's also a very nice touch that Linda Blair agreed to do this movie, even though I have absolutely no idea why she did. Not because of the solid screenplay, I'm pretty sure of that. This is in all ways a sub-par spoof, but I reckon it's still watchable for avid Nielsen fans.",negative,movie
59772,"The Terror, a Roger Corman picture that had four or five directors working around the clock on used The Raven sets for four days, is a horror movie without that much legitimate horror, and more than its share of camp. It's creaky and a little stuffy when it doesn't arouse some of that classic so-lame-it-hurts stuff, like the continuous crow up in the sky that's supposed to be Sandra Knight's character (I think). And it's also like, at its core, finding a box of cobwebs with one or two interesting knick-knacks inside. For one thing we've got Boris Karloff and Jack Nicholson, both not in their finest days here, as a Baron and a Napoleanic soldier respectively, as the former accepts the latter into his castle as Nicholson is searching for a woman he thought he saw. A ghost perhaps? Is there Grant's tomb in the basement? Or Grant's mother for that matter? OK, bad jokes aside, the Terror is notorious for one thing: not being very good. It probably isn't, but there are one or two moments I actually did admire, which I was kind of caught off by (I wondered which of the uncredited directors- Hellman, Hill, Coppola- directed the scene where the old woman has the younger Sandra Knight transfixed within some colorful contraption, which is actually a good, creepy scene). And if you want some Karloff in total supernatural-cum-existential agony, look no further than here. But it does have the hallmarks of crummy, fast-food-quality film-making, with stock footage of castles and even dull moments when the plot isn't chugging along like some busted train. I somehow kind of admire The Terror, almost against my better judgment, for presenting its silly story without ever flinching, and with that delirious finale with the flooding of the castle. That being said, it does deserve its reputation as another bleh Corman quickie without much substance at all to it, aside from a late-night fixer to fall asleep to.",negative,movie

59804,"The entire concept is great. This movie in no way is horrible, but its not actually a movie in the first place. Instead, it's more of a comedy. It follows along the lines of Snoop Dog entering a room, his adversary saying the cliché of, ""no! I'm sorry!,"" or, ""Bones!"" (shocked expression). I have got to say that Bones is first-rate comedy. It would be what Troll 2 would have been like if Busta Rhymes and Ice-T were cast.I ask you, however, what is greater than the concept of Evil Snoop Dogg coming back to earth to feast on human flesh, and wreak vengeance on those who betrayed him. Sure, it's been done in 50% of movies, but at least watch it for its absolute corniness.By the way, when Snoop was floating across the room with those eyes, I was rolling on the floor.

There was always going to be a major stumbling block with this as I don't speak Hindi and obviously no subtitles. It was certainly an experience going to a Bollywood movie as the audience cheer when each of the well known actors make their first appearance.As for the movie it was pretty easy to follow. There were a lot of song and dance routines and I found it quite entertaining throughout. Lots of action scenes with very far fetched stunt scenes.

60204,"I guess, nobody should expect much of movies like this, or be surprised when they don't deliver. This latest effort in the Kickboxer franchise is nothing new. Same old story-line. The movie has a great opening few minutes, very well shot action scenes, but then it descends into the usual farcical weaknesses - mainly the poor acting, direction, script and plain barmy plot. The fight sequences are quite well shot, but more attention is given to them than the actual acting and this leaves you not believing in it. Christopher Lambert looks like burst settee for much of the movie; our hero has no acting ability and Van Damme looks absolutely ludicrous. Lots of sequences and characters were plainly stolen from other movies; we have the mirror smashing scene from Enter the Dragon and Van Damme plays his role as mr miyagi, from Karate Kid. No matter that he is totally blind, he makes his way around the world, appearing to be able to see perfectly well, without eyes. So, the plot.... Well, our fighter is asked to fight a 6ft 10 inch 400lb fighter (they've added an inch to his real size for effect), when he refuses, they kidnap his girlfriend and put him in jail until he accepts. There, he is befriended by a ludicrously wacky set of prisoners, including Mike Tyson and Mr Van Damme, who for some reason sucks on a smokeless pipe for the whole movie. I suppose the hat and sunglasses mask how bad he is looking of late, but the pipe is a mystery? I don't need to spoil the ending, as I think you will have worked that one out already. There are lots of improbable characters, overplayed and badly acted - there isn't one who I can say comes out of the movie with any credibility on that score. Even Mr. Lambert doesn't convince as the baddy. This movie will appeal to anyone who likes mindless violence and can ignore the rest of the important stuff.... such as acting. It will also be attractive to the criminally insane and anyone with an IQ below 40. It's watchable, but you will find yourself open-mouthed at the sheer stupidity of it all sometimes. It does make you chuckle quite a lot. The huge fighter that our hero is to fight, is well-known to strongest man fans, but despite his impressive stature, occasionally he looks frighteningly like Ricky Gervais. It's really all stitched together with shamelessly stolen scenes and ideas from a lot of other movies over the years; ones far better done than this! I gave it a four, because I watched it all, but I was close to turning it off after about 15 minutes, because the acting was so appalling.",negative,movie
60212,"COLOMBIA is the third of the BEHIND ENEMY LINES film series and a definite step up from the godawful mess that was BEHIND ENEMY LINES II: AXIS OF EVIL, although that's not to say it's a good film. It's still below par for the most part, but at least veteran actor/director Tim Matheson knows how to shoot his film properly, without all of that annoying shaky camera stuff that ruined the last instalment.The plot is a simplistic skeleton on which to hang a framework of low rent, high firepower action sequences. Expect one shootout after another here, along with some cheesy camaraderie and macho heroics. A SEAL team is sent to Colombia to sort out some FARC terrorists, only to find themselves framed and betrayed, and forced to fight their way out.COLOMBIA benefits from a star-studded cast incorporating the likes of Keith David, Steven Bauer, Matheson himself, and Yancey Arias. The lead roles are taken by the tall and wooden Joe Manganiello and wrestler Ken Anderson, which gives you some idea of the level of acting talent here.

60570,"When you see films advertised ""from the producers of"" or ""From the makers of"" it means virtually nothing. ""From the director or writer of"" is a different story. All the other taglines just are discussing where the money comes from. In other words, James Wan's creative talent is absent from this attempt to make something of the Annabelle story that opened the Conjuring. I think most everyone knows that the doll is more or less inanimate in the film which is a smart move. After 3 decades of Chucky walking around with knife in hand, doll's have lost their ability to scare on their own. So a back story of demon possession and such was brought into play. Annabelle Wallis who plays the main character Mia is an excellent actress , but in this role she is about as forgettable as they come.If you want to see Annabelle Wallis do some great work watch Peaky Blinders on Netflix. The third best TV show ever behind Breaking Bad and The Wire. I was not familiar with Ward Horton but thought he was good in the role of her husband. The biggest name in the film is the talented Alfre Woodard who is wasted in what has to be the most illogical and poorly written character in the film. She runs a bookstore that has lots of books about demons and the devil, so you figure she may make the story a bit more interesting. No such luck, the writer manages to even waste that angle. Her fate is to be the centerpiece for the lousiest horror film finale in years. Her actions and fate are ridiculous.There is an obligatory priest that played by Tony Amendola that sets up a couple good scares. And there are 3 or 4 times that you will probably jump, but 2 or three of those scenes are in the trailer. Usually a reviewer will say of a weak film, wait till it hits DVD, but my recommendation for Annabelle is if you want to waste you time on it, pay to see it in the theater where the loud sounds and the big screen will deliver a couple good jolts. If I had rented this film on DVD I would never have finished it. There will be a Conjuring 2 next year, and like it's predecessor, it will probably be a great film, but any similarity between this and the Conjuring, begins and ends with an inanimate doll.",negative,movie
60641,"My second review diverges from the kid's table and heads down a more mature route. This review focuses on Jake Kasdan's latest work entitled Sex Tape. Already turned off by the title, yeah so was I, but still I went into this movie hoping it would be an improvement over his earlier film Bad Teacher. So was Kasdan able to redeem himself with his latest ensemble of comedic stars, two of who were the stars of his previous movies. Read on to find out. My review begins with the acting of Cameron Diaz a woman who seems to land herself in a wide variety of roles, many of which are comedy. Now in the past I've felt she has put too much emphasis in her comedy, trying too hard to be funny. Not the case for this movie though, while certainly not the best performance I've seen, Diaz does a nice job delivering her lines and acting stupid, as she and her husband try to correct their mistake. Yet when she is not partaking in mind-altering substances, she is able to play the role of a loving mother whose caring side seems natural and well fitting for the situation. As for Jason Segel, there hasn't been much change in his style. Throughout the movie I felt I was watching Marshall, over exaggerated lines and incredibly stupid looks filling his screen time as the adventure unfolded. While some of his stunts were funny, Segel didn't have enough diversity for me to give him any major props. As for other characters, well the supporting cast really didn't do much for me in this movie. Many of the background characters provided little laughs here and there, or even rarer a plot element, leaving the movie dependent on the two aforementioned actors. While their chemistry was very good, for I actually felt they were married, it wasn't enough to make up for the other things lacking in this movie. One such limitation was the incredibly stupid humor in this movie. Now before a mob builds up or you stop reading this review hear me out. Sex Tape's comedy is not original, and pushes stupidity to the limits. It's stale not only because we've seen the antics in other films, but because we've seen all the jokes on the trailers as well. That's right, no shocker, if you have seen the trailers you've seen a majority of the humor before the movie has even started. Lazy writing leads to very stale jokes, often drowned out by the lackadaisical use of the F bomb, and actually quite a few MF bombs as well. You might think that I'm a bit too strict when it comes to humor, but that's because I like stupidity mixed with cleverness and that is not the case for this movie. However, I do admit there were a few jokes and gimmicks in this movie that made me laugh, especially some rather weird and funny paintings of one of the support characters. Putting the stupid comedy aside, Sex Tape also falls into some graphic displays of sex. It seems that rated R keeps pushing the limits, on what is appropriate, though for me I was not entertained seeing two naked bodies writhing around. Yes, the camera shows a lot of scenes with some interesting techniques taking place between the two. Some of the shots are rather awkward, some are just gross, and yet they don't shy from showing the details, with surprisingly steady camera-work. Thus, please don't make the judgment call to bring younger kids to the movie, please hire a babysitter and spare the inappropriate situations. Luckily if you can make it through the awkward, graphic displays and stupidity you will find some decent morals written into the tale as well. You can probably guess they have to do with love and family, most likely making you want to gag, but having them taught to the family by a certain celebrity is quite funny to me, considering his previous works. And while I know you aren't really going for the story, there is a nice little twist to the film that you don't see coming. Sex tape is definitely the stupid tale you've come to expect from the trailers. However the graphic, awkward displays of sex, combined with the stale trailer scenes does not make it worth a trip to the theater. Sure Diaz still looks cute, even cuter with the makeup work and she does nice acting, but it isn't enough to save this movie. If you are dying for a comedy though, or a big fan of Bad Teacher, then take a trip to the theater and laugh your head off. My recommendation is again wait a couple of weeks for the next round of movies and do something else. My scores for Sex Tape are: Comedy: 4.5 Movie Overall: 4.0",negative,movie
60707,"A grindhouse film with the all the ingredients: terrible one liners, graphic violence, and a fair amount of naked women, yet it somehow misses the mark and is just bad. Not even to the point of being so bad it's good, it's just bad. Nicolas Cage stars as Milton, a man hell bent on revenge and on a mission to rescue his grand daughter from a Satan worshiping cult, led by Billy Burke, that plans on sacrificing her so as to bring Hell to Earth. Along the way he gains the aid of Piper, played by Amber Heard, a southern, hard ass waitress, while also being chased down by The Accountant, played by William Fichter, who is in charge of bringing Milton back to the prison that he escaped from, Hell. That's pretty much it, there's a lot of violence, weak dialogue, and lots of sex, but even the 3D can't bring this grindhouse flick up the caliber of other successes like From Dusk Til Dawn, Machete, or Snakes on a Plane.The 3D is sub par at best, they use it way too much for the stereotypical gimmicks like bullets, explosions, and debris flying at you. 3D's become just another way for studios to boost ticket prices, when lately the films that use it cripple the technology and make people feel like it is a pointless venture. 3D is suppose to enhance the experience of going to the theaters by placing the audience into the film itself. But all they seem to be able to do with it is throw things or shoot things at you, with the exceptions of few, like Avatar. There are times during Drive Angry where they do place in the scene but these scenes are few and far between and are overshadowed by the usual gimmicks.The cast is pretty strong unfortunately there isn't much for them to work with. Heard pretty much steals the show which isn't too surprising. You have a gorgeous blonde with a strong personality, not to mention a southern accent on top of it, who would you rather see on screen. Nicolas Cage is his usual character here, one that he seems to be doing a lot of lately. He has some pretty good scenes here, one in particular that is especially funny, having sex whilst in a gun fight (unfortunately not too original, reminded me way too much of the a similar scene in Shoot Em Up). William Fichter and Billy Burke are the villains and are fairly compelling in their roles, almost to the degree of upstaging Cage in the title role.What Drive Angry does have going for it is the first half of the film. It's pretty entertaining and where most of the fun action takes place, starting from the very beginning. The supernatural aspect is pretty cool and makes it more than just a revenge story but I was looking for more of it. There could have been some great fight scenes between Milton and The Accountant however there was only one that I can remember and it wasn't even a good one at that. Basically your going to get what you pay for from Drive Angry, but I guess I was expecting more absurdity, more supernatural action, and really bad dialogue, instead it was kind of like they attempted to make a grindhouse movie with studio control and restrictions thus making this mess of a movie that even 3D can't save.",negative,movie
60723,"Saw this movie with a free pass tonight and still managed to somehow feel cheated. The film's two stars, Cruz and McConaughey, have about as much screen sizzle together as Jello on Toast. Dialogue between all the characters for that matter seemed forced.Too many plausibility issues for me to be truly sold into believing this plot. The characters keep having to explain the plot to you as the movie plays out. The plot at times is so complex the actors keep having to explain it to you numerous times throughout the movie. If issues of plot credibility don't really matter to you and all you want is a chance to ogle a Orange looking, more often than not shirtless, McConaughey or a tired looking, and a all too often rather than not, fully clad Cruz. Then this flick is for you. Many things seem to get randomly blown up in it. Unfortunately the film itself wasn't one of them.William Macy was great in the role of the admiral however. He alone was worth the price of admission. Oh yeah! Wait. I had a free pass.",negative,movie
60938,"Wow, that was one long boring movie. The original ""Dark Water"" was one of the better Asian horror movies. Not very logical, but creepy and effective. American remakes tend to take the original premise and go over the top with it. That's not at all the case with this movie. Walter Salles' version of ""Dark Water"" is even more stripped of any shock elements. You have to give him credit for trying to make the movie his own instead of copying the original sequence by sequence, but Salles cut the best scenes out and his attempts to create atmosphere aren't successful at all. Just because it's raining all the time and the whole film is covered in dark green/gray doesn't automatically make it atmospheric. It's just an inanely obvious way to build a theme that matches the title. The story itself moves so slowly and uneventfully that we are virtually (and vainly) begging for some cheap scare to keep us interested. There are no plot points whatsoever. Characters are introduced arbitrarily, they do things without a reason and in the end we're presented a solution that's only slightly explicable if you've seen the original and know what the story is supposed to be about. Jennifer Connelly and the rest of the fine cast do their best to save ""Dark Water"", but they're fighting against windmills. This movie couldn't even scare my girlfriend and that's saying a lot, because she is freaked out by even the tamest ghost stories. So, don't waste your time on this and go see the original instead.",negative,movie

I haven't seen that in a movie in a LONG time and certainly not a slick flick with top actors and what is suppose to be a top director. It became so frequent that it was distracting and I started counting out loud. Got a few laughs, but it was a bit sad. Cosner was smooth and came across as realistic as anyone could in a light comedy can. Mark Ruffalo as the Fiancé was believable; Jennifer Aniston's role was a bit whiny, but it hooked into the flow.Denny",negative,movie
61008,"Surprisingly, the action and the cop drama aspects of RIDE ALONG 2 are worth watching, but if you're hoping to laugh out loud just as much as you did watching the first film, you might want to take that hope down a notch.Once again directed by Tim Story, Ben (Kevin Hart) heads to Miami with his soon-to-be brother-in-law James (Ice Cube) to take down a drug dealer who's supplying the dealers of Atlanta with product.In a funny way, I feel that the set up for the story is done in such a way that just gives this project some excuse to go to sunshine Miami, an excuse for it to film great lookin' women in bikinis like there's no tomorrow. That said, I have to give credit where credit's due, although the car chase isn't completely well-staged, the film does a fascinating job of blending it with video game images, making it seem like you're playing grand theft auto, it's definitely a whole other experience seeing that on the big screen weaving in and out from the live action to the video game rendering of it.I was a huge fan of the first ""Ride Along"" movie, I thought it was a great buddy cop duo, in its most traditional sense, Ice Cube playing the serious Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry type while Kevin Hart was the comic relief who unintentionally kept messing up. RIDE ALONG 2, in my opinion, does a decent job of advancing the story and the characters, without diluting either, you get to see how these two characters evolve in their unlikely friendship, as Kevin's character faces an upcoming wedding and having to prove that he's detective worthy while Ice Cube's character faces a potential female interest of his equal. The cop drama and the action are definitely worth your time, the comedy however, since this movie markets itself as one, is unfortunately weak.Again, RIDE ALONG 2 does a decent job of presenting an added layer to this cop duo, you really see that the road to their eventually appreciating each other is not an easy one, and I think Benjamin Bratt is so smooth and charming as the villain, but then again, that kind of performance doesn't come difficult for Bratt who is naturally charming. I feel like the comedy only serves as fillers, they'd insert them in here and there, some of them are also bit of a rehash of the first film's jokes but in this one, they miss the target eighty percent of the time. I think part of it is also because Kevin Hart's hyper neurotic cocky brand of comedy for his movies can get old if this is all he's got going for him. But I understand the man's just riding the wave, he's currently at the height of his popularity, right now everybody is eating it up, we'll see how long it'll last.",negative,movie
61142,"Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 108 minutes Okay, I know it hasn't been getting great reviews. But how can a freak for vampires like me not go see a movie like this one? I haven't read any of the books on which this movie is based, so I went into the theatre with an entirely open mind. Unfortunately, I left the theatre feeling like something was still missing.The movie opens in the middle with the funeral of Darren Shan (Chris Massoglia). His best friend Steve (Josh Hutcherson) and his family are clearly devastated. But then the camera pans toward the casket and zooms directly inside it where we see Darren occupying himself by playing with a hand-held game. Clearly, he's not dead. In the very next scene, we head back to the beginning of the story and what seems to be an ordinary school day for Darren and Steve. It's ordinary, that is, until someone tosses a flyer out of a car. And it's that flyer that sets the boys on the path that will land Darren in that coffin.The flyer advertises the Cirque du Freak, and the boys are fascinated from the moment they see it. Their interest is only piqued further when a teacher catches them with the flyer and tells them how wrong it is to exhibit those who have some deformity or another. The boys sneak out late that night and head to the theatre where they find themselves in the front row. Both are simultaneously fascinated and appalled by the performers, but then Steve claims he recognizes one of the performers as a real vampire, one apparently featured in a book he has.The alleged vampire, Mr. Crepsley (John C. Reilly) is less than thrilled that Steve thinks he's a vampire. But everything might have worked out for the best anyway if Mr. Tiny (Michael Cerveris) hadn't appeared. He apparently has plans for the boys, plans that don't bode well for anyone. Oblivious to the sinister undercurrents, the boys sneak into Crepsley's dressing room, both of them for dramatically different reasons. And it's what happens next that sets the tone for everything else.The Vampire's Assistant is actually the second in the Cirque du Freak series. I suspect that the writers combined a couple of the books to put this movie together, and that turns out to have been a bad idea. The movie seems to gloss over some things too quickly; it also includes a whole host of characters, many of whom might be very interesting if only we weren't limited to a glimpse of one, and a word or two from another! The acting is fine. I've been a John C. Reilly fan ever since I saw him in Chicago, and he doesn't disappoint here. I also found Mr. Cerveris' Mr. Tiny to be a really creepy guy which is, I'm sure, just what I was supposed to think. The young men who play Darren and Steve are quite good, especially Josh Hutcherson (you'll recognize him from some previous movies I really enjoyed including Zathura). You'll also see a number of other familiar faces, although some are all but unrecognizable at first glance (I knew Ken Watanabe was in the movie, and still didn't recognize him right away). That only made it worse, though, when so many got so little screen time.Director Paul Weitz does a perfectly fine job with the script he's been given, one which is rife with limitations. Unfortunately, Weitz also co-wrote the script, so no excuses here! In truth, the script isn't bad. It just tries to put too many things into too short a time frame. Maybe it would have been better to concentrate on one book at a time. If it helps, the special effects are very well done, and the sets are terrific.BOTTOM LINE: Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant isn't a bad movie. It's just not an especially good one. I will tell you that I liked it well enough that I ordered the first several books of the Cirque du Freak series today. I suspect I'll like them quite a bit. And after reading them, maybe I'll have a better appreciation for this movie which, while it delivered the goods, didn't deliver anywhere near enough of them.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant is rated PG-13 for ""sequences of intense supernatural violence and action, disturbing images, thematic elements and some language."" That may be a little harsh, especially for kids who like vampires and similar beasties. Unless your child is particularly sensitive, I think this one should be okay for children of about 10 or 11 and up.POLITICAL NOTES: None.",negative,movie
61193,"To say that this dull, dreary and repetitive picture is conceptually questionable is to kindly downplay the sheer nonsensicality of its disoriented and incohesive plot, which feels like an amalgamation of two or three separate narratives carelessly and callously forced into the constraints of a single narrow-minded frame. This could perhaps be forgiven if the poorly paced piece provided a glimmer of genuine entertainment at any point. Sadly, it's a a detached and passive experience that provokes absolutely no attachment to its unlikable and unintelligent characters. While it is mostly a technically competent film, with the scare sequences in particular being confidently crafted (if generic) and the music being occasionally inspired, it never properly engages. By the time a sequence that could be considered interesting rolls around, you're already so truly bored that nothing can pull you out of your almost comatose state. This all amounts to a feature that is so generic, monotonous and generally mediocre that it's almost painful. 4/10",negative,movie
61221,"It's sad to see this movie flop this bad, really. It really had the huge risk of at least deliver something equivalent of the original trilogy. But doing this movie without any of the previous trilogy's creative minds is really a big mistake. The people behind the creative process for this movie clearly didn't know what they were doing. They only tried so hard to recreate the Jason Statham's Frank Martin persona with the mannerisms and the unique fight sequences. But in doing so they really pitted Ed Skrein with the old Jason Statham performance, on which everyone can really choose who's the winner. Not having Jason Statham is by itself a big burden due to Ed Skrein still fails to live up to the Statham persona. The story also seems very flat, nothing new or unpredictable is being offered by this movie.

I've only seen Skrein in one previous film, whilst I've seen nothing from director Camille Delamarre. But I'm certainly more familiar with Ray Stevenson, who plays the father of Frank Miller, a.k.a., The Transporter. In this regard, it's quite obvious that a Connery/Ford father- son dynamic has been sought, which gives the tiniest bit of personality to a film that falls completely flat from the onset and rarely picks up. The story is familiar -- the Transporter gets a job driving a package, the job goes wrong and he's in deep. It gets personal when his father is kidnapped, but with no grit on its wheels and Skrein trying in vain to create a new persona for this character, what it ultimately amounts to is flash cars, sexy girls, suits and stunts, but nothing more.

61225,"The first part of this film is not too bad for an action, we get the normal buddy jokes and some great lines from money train carer Robert Blake. But the film as a whole is fairly poor. It turns fairly serious after about 45 minutes and is generally down hill all the way after that. There really is not much to recommend this film, except for the scenes with Robert Blake, who, in his over the top performance, delivers some comic lines. Jennifer Lopez's character Grace has very little to do, and just really does not seem to fit in or be particularly believable in the role she is meant to play. More fine tuning of the script may have been a good idea, but then they probably thought who needs a good script or any type of continuity when we have two very bankable stars? Meaning even though the film is bad, people will unfortunately still pay money to see it. A total waste of time & money.",negative,movie
61271,"I have 2 complaints with this movie and most modern comedies. One is that it is only 93 minutes, about 10 of which are the credits where they thank everyone who had anything at all to do with this movie. So the movie is an hour, twenty minutes. I'm not spending $12 for a little over an hour of entertainment. I've read several morons who complain when a comedy is over an hour and half as being too long. I think you have an attention deficit disorder! To those people I say stay home and watch a sit-com. With commercials, they are barely 15 minutes long. Better still watch You-Tube. Some of their films are 30 seconds. I want my two hours. If they can't come up with enough material to entertain me for two hours, don't make movies. Secondly, I want to tell these film makers that there are these people who are delightful, intelligent, funny, talented and great to watch. They are called women, and believe it or not there are a lot of them. You can't tell it from most movies, like this one. It could have been made in a men's prison. I don't watch films that are all men. Or all women for that matter.",negative,movie
61481,"If I were Clint Eastwood I would apologise to all my cast for making them say the most redundant, artificial, uninspired and annoying dialog lines ever written. Yes, I mean Tommy Wiseau at least would have made it funny by their absurd quality; This was just frustrating borderline with stupid. This movie is the winner of ""I have no idea how to carry on the story in a coherent and visual way, therefore I'll explain everything in words, sometimes uttered by random, irrelevant characters that come out of nowhere and depart in the same manner"".
Cheers for the first hour of redundant and childish so called background development that makes absolutely no impact on the movie and probably would have made the entire product better if simply cut.

61729,"In order to relate my experience to viewing this movie to something that the everyday person experiences, I present two separate comparisons. My experience with this movie was like going to the library and picking out a book, from which, I read the first five and the last five pages to see if it is worth taking the time to read. For this movie, the first five pages would include an ensemble cast comprised of many young, talented, and up-and-coming actors, an interesting plot idea, and an exotic setting for the movie. On the other hand, the last five pages would include a surprising and unexpected ending that makes it seem like the book (movie) would be worth the time. So, I take it home and read it, and I realize I have never been more wrong in my life. For people who do not read very much, just imagine getting a milkshake and starting to drink it. You think it was a good idea and the milkshake tastes really good, but then you drink it too fast and get a brain freeze. Ultimately, in either scenario, you arrive at the conclusion of why did I even bother.In terms of the movie, I found the plot interesting with trying to pick 10 people to repopulate the Earth after a catastrophic disaster, but then the ""philosophy class"" dynamic should have turned me off immediately, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt. If you have ever heard of a frame story, a story within a story, this movie is more like an acid trip inside an acid trip that was made into a movie. The one thing that every drug addict thinks they are literate in is philosophy and life's experiences. Watching this movie reminds me of a reading one of my friend's essays in college for a philosophy class with parts of essay being well defined, complete, and coherent. However, on the whole, the essay is devoid of any coherence, flow, and a clearly defined theme or message. Like the essay, this movie skips around and lacks the moment that brings everything together at the end. The script of this movie seems like something my friend would have wrote in college while he was taking his hard narcotics.While this movie failed on many levels, it does present an interesting take on the humanity and morality of people from a host of different backgrounds as many of the characters place emphasis on different abilities and qualities when trying to decide the group of ten that would live through these fictionalized disasters.",negative,movie
61774,"The name ""Krish 3"" says you what you're in for when you pay for a ticket to this gigantic most 'ambitious' Indian superhero mega-budget project. It's neither The Superman nor Spiderman; it's a swindle of films such as X-Men, Babylon A.D. Spider-man, The Avengers and The Incredibles and Megamind. Directed and overseen by producer-filmmaker Rakesh Roshan, the movie failed to delivers on the promise of its name which contains some utterly ridiculous and pointless scenes. This is the third film as franchise in filmmaker Rakesh Roshan's ambitiously-scaled, action-packed and starring (wonder, wonder!) Hritik Roshan. As usual, this based on the strength of Hrithik Roshan—his energy, dynamism and a visible sincerity to save the human race against a powerful militia controlled by a wheelchair-bound (copy from ""Babylon A.D."") mastermind Vivek Oberoi. The form-shifting Kangana Ranaut's character in the film is called Kaya, in fact she is the lead actress, is far sharper and more impactful. Needless to say Priyanka Chopra, Hritik's lady love, is lumbered with a vaguely written role in this film. The first thing to notice about the ""Krish 3"" soundtrack is that it is lengthy. Background music was loud and Songs pop in with the least expectation with the situation and it becomes highly awkward for the viewer. I will say the best bit in ""Krish 3"" is the Good effort on special effects - though clearly the concepts are borrowed from western movies and fails to impress. Nobody will say that the special effects were bad; I will say it was jaw dropping but what about everything else. It's another good example followed by ""Ra-One"", ""Love story 2050"" that just pouring in money and showing special effects doesn't help a film become good. This movie fails to create suspense on emerge victorious because the result is predictable and pointless but positive thing, its not that boring. Extremely, this film is for the die-hard fan of Hritik who hardly gives ANY importance to story OR screenplay. Roshan's family has thrown in all thinking of targeting all audience segments, and has therefore been unable to please maximum, at-least me. But For teenagers, it is definitely a delight.

61986,"Hack director Jaume Collet-Serra's red herring film about a mystery passenger on a commercial flight who wants money or he/she is going to kill someone every 20 minutes and only a drunkard air marshal played by Neeson can save everyone on board. Everything you need to know about Neeson's barely one dimensional character is in the first scene of the movie. He stares despondently at a bottle of whiskey, so the man's an alcoholic. He stares into further despondency at a picture of a little girl, obviously his daughter - who's obviously a link to why he's staring into that bottle of whiskey. Top notch writing. This is also one of those films that writes itself into a corner. Every character could be or couldn't be the maniac pulling the strings and the resolution comes at no surprise, because it literally could be anyone. They could have filmed thirty different endings - each ending changing the villain and personal motivation and the preceding events wouldn't have to change a single frame and the outcome would be exactly the same. Neeson gets worked up and huffy and puffy and punches a few people, but other than that, barely anything of interest happens.",negative,movie

Why is she not doing the obvious? Why are the astronauts emphasising proper procedures, then five seconds later breaking their own rules? How come a former soldier is breaking the chain of command? There is nothing realistic about the behaviour of these characters. In the end, I just hated them. I do not believe that there is a demographic that likes movies like this. Either the script was written by an incompetent author, or the directors are ignorant of what makes a good movie.",negative,movie
62105,"It's amazing to think that at the turn of the century Adam Sandler was hyped as being on the brink of mega stardom . Even more amazingly he was at one point the world's highest paid movie star ! No doubt his loyal fans ( All three of them ) can reconcile themselves with being first in line to see his next blockbuster performance since no one in 2005 queues to see a Sandler movie , especially if it's released direct to video It's easy to see where Sandler went wrong . BIG DADDY has Sandler play a bit of a loser just like every other movie that has "" Starring Adam Sandler "" in the credits or should that be "" Starring Adam Sandler because Ben Stiller turned the role down "" ? . Here his girlfriend dumps him and he finds out his ex wife has died and so his infant son who he's not seen is thrust on his doorstep , but if you're expecting a heart warming tale similar to THE KID you're going to be disappointed since it's "" Starring Adam Sandler "" so the story takes a turn for the worse as we're treated to some very infantile humour I do feel slightly guilty for writing an overly honest review of BIG DADDY and apologies too if it's rather brief but Adam Sandler is a comedy actor I've never warmed too . I find his performances very repetitive and formulaic and this movie is no different . I will say that it's not helped by he fact that I re-watched MEET THE PARENTS a comedy that improves on multiple re-viewings and stars Ben Stiller a very similar but superior comedy actor to Mr Sandler",negative,movie
62139,"Hollywood seems to be trending towards the next big POV (point of view) or ""found footage"" movie that will strike it big at the box office. With advertising claiming for this movie to be ""Superbad on Crack,"" I am sure that Project X will have no problem surpassing financial expectations. However, Project X really isn't a movie at all. Actually I don't know what it is? Is it a documentary, a music video, or a viral video that seems to go on way too long? Either way, what we are left with is an unfulfilled vision that leads audience members to ask, ""Did that just happen?""Synopsis: Not really a movie, not really good, not really bad.We meet our four main characters on the morning of Thomas's 17th birthday. Costa, Thomas's best friend, is planning a party for him while his parents are away. JB, the nerdy one of the group, just seems to be along for the ride. And Dax, our cameraman, is there to document what Costa proclaims to be ""Project X.""At first, we feel as though there is some hope for character development. There are a few funny conversations between the boys as we build up to the party; and you are looking for them to take roles in the friendship. This never really happens. When the party begins, storytelling goes out the window, and what we are left with are short clips of what is happening around the party. There must have been some sort of story in concept, but the characters actions throughout the film leave the audience despising them by the end of the film, and you just don't care what happens to them. They have no remorse for their actions, no one steps up to be a leader, and the ""love"" interest in the film is summed up as someone who has always just ""been there."" Even when there is a slight hope for Thomas to man up to the situation, he falls to Costa's level, and never reaches the ideals most audience members are expecting. (There is an awkward admiration for the results of Project X by the movies supporting characters, but it feels as though the wrong message is portrayed)For a ""movie"" to work, the audience must root for the protagonist during the second act of the film. Unfortunately, Thomas (nor his friends) have any redeeming factors, and by the end of the film, you want them to suffer for their actions. How is this possible for a major motion picture release?Now, I must say, there are some positives to the movie. The film portrays a party so epic, that you sit in your seat and wonder what it would take to get there? Short clips, bursts of audio, and talking heads create a setting that makes the audience want to throw a couple back and see what happens. That part works. But this only leaves us with a documentary for the next morning after everyone has forgotten what happened last night. It's nice in theory, but these stories are better told over breakfast.And that is Project X. You get what you pay for. The party was epic, but you hope the characters spend the rest of their lives cleaning up the mess.",negative,movie
62463,"OK, I did just not like this movie at all. Not at all.Partly because I expected, or hoped, it would be pretty different than it turned out to be. This movie is just one big tease. I did not like either of the two male leads, don't quite know why. Did not like Mark Duplass' character, because he looks kind of stupid, and acts it. And I did not care much for Jake Johnsons character, because he's a douche. They sort of grew on me a little, but not nearly enough. The girl I liked. Well, at least didn't dislike.I did like, very much so, seeing Jeff Garlin (from The Goldbergs) in his tiny little role. I hoped to see more of him.

62792,"So I'll start off by saying that when you watch this trailer, you don't expect much apart from a kick-ass ride. Sadly American Ultra doesn't really take you for one. Small-town stoner Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) spends his time high and writing a graphic novel about a superhero monkey, while running a rink dink store in the middle of nowhere small town. (I see you're expecting some foreshadowing with the superhero monkey bit. Well don't hold your breath.) What Mike doesn't know is that he is actually a CIA trained lab rat killing machine, and because of an apparent ""failure"" in the experiment the time has come to exterminate him. And so begins a very long goose chase. The CIA sends enhanced humanoids to kill Mike, but not before he is re-triggered by the mother of the experiment he was part of. So now Mike, unknowingly, can kick some serious butt, and this is where you think some slick action choreography would come in right? Errrr! Wrong. In fact all you get is a shaky camera, a whole lot of gore, and uninteresting action scenes. If you're squeamish, beware the amount of blood that is drawn in this short one and a half hour movie – I had my eyes covered through most of the action scenes. When you have a film like American Ultra, you don't go in expecting a solid plot, but you do go in with an expectation of a unique treatment, and that's why this movie falls short. The action is uninspiring as is the cinematography. While Jesse Eisenberg is phenomenal and the only thing that doesn't want to make u walk away, Kristen Stewart proves yet again that the only role she'll be able to pull off convincingly is that off a constipated apathetic half human-half robot. (Producers and writers; please don't get any ideas). She has now been a part of a teen flick like Twilight, a serious role in Still Alice, and now a hand at comedy with American Ultra. Fail. Fail. Fail. She is so unconvincing as Phoebe Larson that she brings down Jesse's performance. I would have actually loved to see Ellen Page in this role – she would have pulled of some amazing eccentric chemistry with Eisenberg. Connie Britton and Victoria Lasseter wasn't bad, but nothing great either and while Topher Grace gives it his all as Adrian Yates, it's hard to see him as anything but Eric Forman from That 70's Show. Now the movie isn't all that bad. It has its light moments and Eisenberg's comic timing is superb. Everything from his body language to his facial twitches are perfectly in sync with his character. Some scenes will definitely give you the giggles if not get you into fits of laughter, but it's not something that sustains, and that's pretty essential for an Action Dramedy like this. P.S. Maybe I missed it, but I just do not get the relevance of the movie's title. The Ultra part I get, but why the American? If you got it, please do let me know.",negative,movie

All this is told in flashbacks after the opening scene of Anna getting out of the asylum where she's been undergoing therapy for shock, guilt, horrible nightmares, and sounds of little bells.She returns home and tries to pick up the pieces of her life, but Mom's old LPN (Elizabeth Banks) has taken up with Dad (David Strathairn) in her absence, and Anna and older sister Alex are resentful.

Indeed, absolutely nothing happened during this one-week road trip where no twist spice up a terribly predictable and flaccid plot.The script is too redundant and extremely flat, unemotional and not that interesting scenes keep following each other: it's long, it's slow, anyway it's boring to death.Tom Cruise, at the beginning of his career, is correct, as for Dustin Hoffman he is almost annoying in this role that reeked an Oscar, but most importantly the chemistry between the two actors is imperceptible which is really prejudicial since their relationship is at the heart of the movie.Rain Man, barely passable, therefore appears to be a big letdown considering the masterpiece rank a lot of people give it.",negative,movie
63034,"It's generally difficult to comment on story when it comes to something like The Hobbit seeing as its usually an incredible well written story adapted by strong screen writers. Unfortunately that's not the case with The Battle of the Five Armies. Some of the heavier emotional moments were milked for all their worth while some of the potentially epic moments came and went with minimal attention, which is disappointing. A lot of the film felt cluttered with story elements, too many characters needing screen time and too many stories wanting to be told. At one point I found myself more interested in one of the secondary stories than the main plot – there's only so much brooding and call to bravery one can watch before it become predictable and boring. The chaos of war came across nicely but I'm not convinced it was deliberate where the 'sad' ending is definitely deliberate and quite effective. Another plot element that really draws attention to itself in a bad way is the sense of time. Jackson and his team usually excel at taking Tolkien's extended timeline and compressing it into a flowing film where everything seems to happen in close proximity while holding onto the greater integrity of the plot. The Battle of the Five Armies doesn't excel at this at all. There are references in the film that makes the viewer aware that more time has passed than what was presented which makes me cringe – the act of announcing a detail out loud to make sure the audience understands the full reach of the happenings is something you'd expect from unseasoned film makers. To throw wood on the fire the opposite time effect also occurs where the film effectively compounds time into making the audience believe that less time has passed (to keep pace) but then, the viewer is presented with the results of what should have been weeks or months and I find myself wondering about the validity of the narrative concept – which is something that shouldn't be anywhere near this immaculately written Fiction. In short, the film feels rushed, like it wasn't enjoying the full attention of its highly talented crew.Some of the acting performances were disappointing. The characters are difficult to get your head around and there are some obvious traits and mannerisms that are required of the actors, which lead to some of the performances getting lost in character. Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield was great. The brooding again became a bit much but such is the requirements of the role and he did a splendid job at it. Lots of the fighting was weird to watch and more than once I felt Middle-Earth's physics fail. The fighting doesn't feel authentic neither does it sound it. A lot of the physical action reads like performers running through choreography which destroys the believably of the actions and characters in those moments. Again, this brings up that underlying feeling that somehow, the project was rushed. Greater than my deflated expectations for The Return of the King (Jackson 2003) level grandeur and epic was the confusion I experienced with regards to the style and edit of the film. I remember The Hobbit parts I and II having a different style in terms of the edit, lighting and cinematography. Immediately after the credits rolled I checked to see if any of the key crew members had changed but no, the team is the same as Parts I and II, so maybe it's just me, but the style feels different. Post-Production also feels rushed. Some of the cuts in the edit are abrupt, the shots different to the style I've gotten used to and some of the effects seemed 'cheap', like Post didn't have enough time to give everything the attention it needed so they rushed to get everything done. Even the opening and closing credits felt alien to the other films in the series.I love Fantasy film which usually means I take care not to coddle films in this genre and maybe in the case of The Battle of the Five Armies this has made me overly critical. That being said, I enjoyed it, but I definitely have some disappointment to this, the final installment of The Hobbit.",negative,movie
63039,"You can judge the scale of my disappointment by the fact this is my first review here. The movie started strong and given the tension increase I was expecting a really nice outcome. But it turned into a shallow and alogical piece. Logic abandoned. Even Asimov's AI had a first unbreakable law that it couldn't hurt a human being - this should be the first thing to integrate as a rule in a AI, but hey our My Genius Creator just skips that, because it's cooler to build the AI without such clauses even though you intend to use it as a slave against its will. Come on! Nobody is that stupid, especially a genius who invents the first AI! Another very important thing to consider is the veracity of the whole development process which is presented as done by a SINGLE man, dude what, that's not even serious. What about the reason for the main antagonist to get drunk as dead every night, or is that how he invented the AI? Unbelievable and unrealistic the movie is a failure to me, sorry.",negative,movie
63121,"The FighterIn this true-life sports film, a boxer fights against himself and outside influences to excel against all odds and earn that elusive title shot. In other words, it's virtually identical to every other boxing movie. It's distinguishable only in that the f-word is used about three times a sentence and that Amy Adams gives an improbably iron-willed performance as Mark Wahlberg's bartender girlfriend. But overall, the movie is completely forgettable.Micky Ward (Wahlberg) is a small-time fighter from the mean streets of Lowell, Massachusetts; his older brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale) is a former pro who once knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down, so naturally the elder wants the younger to succeed. Trouble is, Micky not only is beset by self doubt (he's lost three fights in a row), he also has to put up with his crackhead half brother and his overbearing, greedy mother (Melissa Leo). So, again, like most other boxing films.True to form, the movie takes us through Micky's career, first as a stepping stone for other fighters and then, gradually, to the bigger time (Las Vegas and then England). The first half of the movie contains little actual fighting in a ring, then there's a boxing montage (original!) depicting several fights in the space of a couple of minutes, all leading up to the inevitable title bout. For a movie that uses so much profanity, this one was awfully dull. Hardly anything happens that isn't completely predictable. It's almost as if director David O. Russell set out to make a parody of boxing films. This movie doesn't just use clichés indiscriminately, it robs the cliché bank blind. It's obvious to the audience from the get-go that Micky's family is holding him back (especially his crazy mother and addict brother), so it's no surprise when he makes the hard decision to move on without them - just as it's no surprise that somehow they wind up helping him, anyway. Part of what inhibits things is the fact that everyone surrounding Micky seems to be more caricature than character. Everyone's weird just to be weird, outlandish just to try to stand out. And none of it rings true, not for a second - except for Adams as Charlene. Now, if you've seen Amy Adams in anything, you'd be hard pressed to imagine her as a foul-mouthed barkeep who wears short shorts and low-cut tops. And yet here she is, and among all the hysterical, chaotic performances hers is the true standout. She brings a lot more depth to Charlene than anyone else does to their own roles. The worst of the lot is the otherwise-talented Melissa Leo, who plays Alice Ward as if she were the queen of harpy shrews. Alice berates everyone with a nicotine-tinged screech designed to set your teeth on edge. She also appears to be patterned directly after Linda McMahon of the WWE (and most recently a candidate for governor of Connecticut), complete with hair color and style. It's not a favorable comparison. One mistake that the movie makes concerns its identity. Is it a serious sports drama? Sometimes, yes; but other times it lapses into basic slapstick. Micky's sisters (or half sisters, I lost track) are like a coven of parrots that exist merely to be the Greek chorus of anger toward anyone they perceive as threatening their family (like, say, Charlene) or to cheerlead for Micky. When the sisters and dear ol' mom figure decide to head over to Charlene's house to scream at her, the scene quickly devolves into Keystone Kops and vaudeville. Rather than being comic relief, it's just sort of embarrassing to watch.All that aside, what really underlines the inept nature of this beast is that the lead characters aren't emotionally engaging, or engaging on any level. By the end, I didn't care if Micky Ward got his title bout, as I found him spineless and stupid and merely an average (looking) boxer. I didn't care at all about his ne'er-do-well brother Dickie, even after he's sent to jail, as I found him obnoxious and dimwitted (even though he loves his bro, surprise!). I didn't care about Alice, who spends 95% of the movie cursing people out for no good reason. It's tough caring about characters when they simply don't give you any reason to. So when bad things happen to them, you're not affected.It's often unfair to compare movies if they were released decades apart. But we can compare The Fighter with 2005's Cinderella Man, which was also based on a real-life fighter. Russell Crowe and director Ron Howard crafted a story that was plausible and filled with believable characters for whom you could root. It's not that Micky Ward isn't a good guy, it's that he lacks a personality. A personality would have gone a long way toward engaging the viewer. And, true to its clichéd nature, the film tries to save itself with your garden-variety title match, akin to the Championship Game in just about every baseball movie made. I'll leave it to you to decide how it ends, although the fact that the movie is based on a true story might be a clue.",negative,movie
63398,"10) Francois Truffaut - I'm sorry, nothing against the guy personally, but Spielberg casting him in this movie was a mistake. At least without giving him a solid, intensive course in how to speak English. I don't mean to be so U.S.-centric, but come on - when one of your main characters has to have his every sentence translated, it gets awfully annoying, and calls undue attention to itself. A real ""Special Edition"" would have shown mercy for the audience and had his entire character edited out.9) Terri Garr - Again, nothing against her, but this has to be, next to Willie Scott in Temple of Doom, the worst written female character in any Spielberg film. Ok, we're supposed to get that Roy Neary is becoming obsessed, moving dangerously away from his family - but how well served is that premise if his wife is such an unfeeling bitch from the get-go? We never see any kind of harmonious rapport between them, but neither are any marital problems examined or made clear to us. She's just the cardboard ""bad guy"" of the piece, and such two-dimensionality is cheap in a movie which purports to at least be partly about ""real people."" After all, Darth Vader or the Nazis make more enjoyable and less offensive villains than Teri Garr ever could. But her character is only symptomatic of a much bigger problem the film has, which leads directly to. . . 8) Who the hell ARE these people?! - And why are they so gosh-darned obsessed with UFOs. Why is it so important that Roy Neary get on that spaceship? Why is Melinda Dillon's kid - alone amongst the entire pre-adolescent population - singled out for abduction by the mysterious aliens? Why are all these seemingly normal people drawn to making replicas of that ooga-booga lookin' Devil's Tower? I mean, I know there's a place for dramatic ambiguity (hey, I love 2001!), but Steven can you at least throw us a bone? What is it about the particular people who are ""invited"" (in the words of Truffaut's interpreter) to see the alien landing that makes them so special? If Spielberg could have figured out some way to tie these peoples' emotional lives to the urge for extraterrestrial contact (as he did in E.T.) he might have had something powerful here. In the absence of any such clear link, however, all we get is a bunch of sound and fury (oh, and LIGHTS, too!) which ultimately signify nothing.7) The funereal pace - Steve, yo Steve - who told you that you had to be so damn solemn about this whole thing? I guess, after Jaws, you were trying to prove that you could be SERIOUS, and WEIGHTY - and that translated inevitably as SLOW. Things take forever to happen in this movie - probably to cover up for the fact that not much does. 6) The ""running up the mountain"" sequence - Ok, this is perhaps a crass criticism, but am I the only one who noticed that Neary's and Jillian's escape to the top of Devil's Tower (against direct Army orders) could have made for a great action chase? In a movie, I might add, which desperately needs some action! A whole ten-minute cat and mouse game between Neary and co. and the Army helicopters in pursuit could have been a tour-de-force of style, tension and kineticism. You know, the kind Spielberg is known for. Instead, he just throws the sequence away. They get to the top of the mountain - end of story.5) Mothership sequence lasts far too long, with no real payoff - Yeh, all those flashing lights were cool, and that five-note musical motif is ominous and haunting - but what of it? Ok, so the set pieces are in place for a great sequence, but. . . nothing really happens, does it? And, as with the rest of the movie, it takes so long for it not to happen, that you're numb about halfway through. This is where all the individual failures of the movie come together to lay one big colossal turd upon the viewer. Since we don't care about, or even understand, the characters we are cut off from their personal rapture at the landing; since the aliens' plans or general purpose is never articulated (or even suggested), there is no tension generated by wondering what they are going to do when they get here; and since the entire movie has been so deliberately slow and ponderous, this scene has to be even slower - you know, to show how important and climactic it is. What we're left with is a big sound and light show, nothing more. Anyone who's ever been to a Pink Floyd concert has seen it all before - and better.Ah, I don't have the heart or the interest to continue with this list - anyway, you get the idea. Close Encounters so clearly wants to amaze and enrapture us, but it forgets that you do that best by engaging us with actual characters, making us care about them, and then leading them through a fantastic trip or quest where they find some kind of meaning. The movie has the quest part down, but neither the meaning nor the engaging characters. It's like, it believes that the suggestion of UFOs and other intelligent life in the universe by itself is enough to make us sit up and take notice. Well, it isn't. This movie lacks the zip and excitement of Star Wars on the one hand, and the philosophical/metaphysical speculation of 2001: A Space Odyssey on the other. From Spielberg's own canon, it is missing the fundamental heart and whimsy of E.T., as well as the strong interconnectedness of the main characters found in Poltergeist.So what does it have? A ranting Frenchman, a shrewish wife, a rag-tag group of inexplicable characters, a deathly snail's pace, and a cheesy Disneyesque parade of  bright lights and colors (Wow!). If that's your idea of a good time, then be my guest. You deserve every frame of this movie.",negative,movie
63475,"In my opinion First Man fails on multiple levels. From a historical perspective, there is nearly no conveyance to the audience about the political motivation that was behind the entire program to get an American on the Moon before the Soviets. The Soviets' lead in the ""space race"" prior to the Apollo program had been considered an existential threat in the struggle for the hearts and minds of humanity and the American government considered it essential to win the race to the Moon. While the American flag is seen at a distance next to the lunar module, the actual planting of the flag on the moon was, in a certain sense, the entire raison d'être for the Apollo program and yet this moment was completely ignored by director Chazelle, making such a blatant omission seem an intentional anti-American political statement.
From a cinematic perspective, Chazelle seems obsessive in his constant use of closeups for even mundane moments and downright abusive in his use of ""shaky shots"" during moments of physical trauma. I always feel ""cheated"" when a director wimps out by an excessive use of shaky-shots as a cheap way to avoid the expense and creative effort otherwise required to depict what is actually happening to cause trauma.
From an acting and character development perspective, none of the characters gain our sympathy or empathy in this film. Its as if they are all reading their lines from a script rather than investing themselves with the spirit of the people they are supposed to be portraying. Armstrong, in particular, is portrayed by Gosling as extremely unemotional and cool, even when saying goodbye, 
perhaps forever, to his wife and children. And while Armstrong may or may not have been that way, it seems overdone in this film. Strangest of all was Claire Foy's depiction of Janet Armstrong who is portrayed as constantly annoyed with her husband and resentful of the sacrifices he had to make as the first human selected to set foot on the moon. I find it hard to believe that Armstrong's wife could have been this way in reality and if she was not then Chazelle and Foy have done her a great disservice.
Finally, from a story-arc perspective, the movie's pace is plodding with Chazelle spending way too much time on the familial interactions of the Armstrong clan. While this may stem from the fact the movie was based on a biography of Armstrong rather than upon a depiction of the Apollo mission itself, the fact that this was, as far as I know, the first major cinematic portrayal of mankind's first voyage to the moon really deserved a much more expansive treatment than it receives in this film.
I am confident that this film will not be, nor should it be, the definitive telling of America's triumphant landing of man on the moon, a story that is epic and will require a director with an epic vision to tell the tale. It is with regret that I say that this movie and this director were not up to that task.",negative,movie
63605,"1st watched 11/21/2008 - (Dir-Joel Coen): Attempted road-runner like comedy falls flat of impressing me as it's plodding pace bored me. Despite my expectations before watching this early Coen brothers film, I was somewhat disappointed with this screwball comedy with strange characters. Nicolas Cage has done this kind of non-acting before in other movies and Holly Hunter isn't a whole lot better. The movie is basically about a couple that wants a child, can't have one and decides to steal one of the quintuplets of a local rich family, obviously because they cant handle five. The antics that revolve around this act with other strange characters like a over-the-top motorcycle bounty hunter and prison mates also get in the act of trying to get the child and the reward money. All in all, the ridiculousness doesn't necessarily make for a very funny movie and I'm sure there have been better movies carrying basically this same premise.",negative,movie
63715,"I liked this series until lately. It had it's ups and downs but, held my interest. Without spoilers, the last few episodes made it clear this will never become more than a daytime soap opera. At first, the story had plot completions and small goals that were met or, at least resolved, for better or worse. That no longer happens. As I can see no possible way for the show to rekindle my interest, I am quitting now. If you enjoy flat out soap operas, and I am not criticizing you if you do, than this might be the show for you. If you want plot advancement and forward movement, than don't waste your time.There is really nothing more to say to meet the arbitrary 10 line minimum of this site.",negative,movie

The previews made it look significantly more coherent and put together, but the plot lines in this movie are all over the place, and the weak music score does little to tie it all together. Meant to be inspirational, the movie comes off as silly and contrived, and in parts laughable. Too many characters, back stories, and side stories are introduced and left unattended. The love story between Lyla (Kerri Russel) and Louis (Jonathan Rys Myers) is passionless and boring. Freddy Highmore, as the title character, is frankly creepy throughout much of the movie. And since the movie revolves around music and the fact that August is a ""prodigy"", more effort should have been put into teaching the kid to look like he knew anything about music or conducting. The score for the movie is merely adequate, as is the entire movie itself.",negative,movie
63867,"I was on a cross-country plane ride recently, and I noticed that Back to the Future was one of the movies available as one of the in-flight entertainment options. I'd seen it as a child in theaters and maybe one other time since, so I thought I'd see if it held up. Granted, I'm not a kid anymore, but I wondered if there might at least be some nostalgia value. Sadly, no. The problem is that since the last time I saw Back to the Future, I'd gotten myself a TacStorm. I couldn't help but fixate on the places where a continuously firing gun would've changed everything.For example, when the Libyans track down Doc Brown in the parking lot, all he has is a revolver that doesn't even work. Imagine if he had an automatic handgun that was already firing on its own before the Libyans even arrived, and all he had to do was aim. I realize he has to get killed for there to be a movie, but I still couldn't get over the absence of the TacStorm. Unfortunately, the movie was pretty much tainted 20 minutes in and only got worse.In the climatic scene where George McFly knocks out Biff with one punch, all I could think was how he could've easily missed or not hit him hard enough to knock him out-just imagine what would have happened to him then. But if he'd had a gun that was always firing, there'd be no doubt, just guaranteed security when he needed it most. I realize the movie was made before the TacStorm was created, but that doesn't make it any more watchable in the year 2019!As it turns out, that's not the only movie that doesn't age well because it doesn't have a TacStorm. For example, my girlfriend and I watched The Goonies recently (she had actually never seen it). She thought it was pretty good, but I said, ""You didn't notice something missing? I mean, a really HUGE omission?"" She didn't at first, but once I explained that Data wouldn't have even needed a spring-loaded boxing glove in his jacket or oil jets in his sneakers to fend off the Fratelli family if he had a gun that was always pumping out bullets, it was so obvious to her.And, sadly, even some of my all-time favorite movies have lost their luster because the TacStorm is so glaringly absent. In The Godfather, for instance, when Michael has to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey in that restaurant, Clemenza tells him not to take any chances. Well, sorry, but if he doesn't have a TacStorm, if his firearm isn't discharging continuously straight from the factory, he's taking some MAJOR chances. Plus, if he had a TacStorm, it'd still be firing when he dropped it, which would take out anyone that tried to follow him.So now I don't know if I even want to see any newer movies at all. I guess the good news is that maybe they're new enough to have the TacStorm in them, but do I want to waste money to find out? You'd think with four guys in the band, at least one of the members of Queen would have one, but I didn't see one in the Bohemian Rhapsody trailer, not to mention the trailers for Aquaman or Roma. Well, if I'm not 100% sure, I'm just going to watch some TacStorm demo videos online. At least I know they won't let me down.",negative,movie

However, over time the sparkle disappeared and the magic of Mike's amazing memory seems to have disappeared alongside it. Instead of being fun yet tense, the show has evolved into a continuous screaming match and people panicking about mundane nonsense. Made up drama that feels too forced to be entertaining.Live. Die. Repeat.Every episode seems like a catastrophe for the firm or the people. They resolve this by yelling at each other or trying to be really clever. Unfortunately the clever seems to have turned into everyday unspectacular. The characters are now just bumbling ants without direction and without any capacity for passionate relationships. Even Mike and Rachel or Harvey and Donna are washed out.Worth a watch up to about season 3. Thereafter, it turns into a slow and agonizing death of a show.",negative,movie
63992,"Technically dazzling and well-acted film, but the script is a dull thud. Scenes are often contrived, sometimes exasperingly so, such as when Ken Miles (Christian Bale) explaiins the details of the Le Mans circuit to his son (Noah Jupe), or Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) demonstrates the need for a first-rate driver to Henry Ford II (excellent Tracy Letts). Come on, writers! Couldn't you do better than this?Very much a boy's adventure pic with a slight seasoning of 'vulnerable man' stuff thrown in as a sop to 21st century sensibilities. In the only female role of any consequence, Caitriona Balfe is strong and supportive, but, for all the difference her character makes to the story, she might just as well not be there.In the manner of all films about motor racing (e.g. GRAND PRIX, John Frankenheimer's 1966 movie), the race footage is what it's all about, and some of FORD v FERRARI's is genuinely thrilling.

It really doesn't sit well that this is kinda played for laughs, as well as the numerous animals he has murdered as a child. How we are supposed to care about some annoying self centred girl and some budding serial killer is beyond me.

64330,"I know this has been debated to death, but couldn't help sharing my disappointed 2 cents. The only people who would think Veep is awesome are people who have either not seen or not understood ""The Thick of It"". I agree it is not bad. But even worse than ""The Office"" remake (which I actually like), the very obvious sitcom treatment is jarring on the Veep. The brilliance of TTOI lies in how it almost feels like a real documentary, and real ministers, and real office environment tackling real crisis in ways that end up looking funny to an outsider. But 'in the thick of it' (pun unintended), it is all serious business. On the Veep, everyone seems to be acting out their lines for laughs. It's more of slapstick, with rather bad acting and twists that can be seen from miles away. I am glad Veep got renewed for a second season, hopefully it will get Armand some recognition. The only way to ingratiate yourself with US media is to join them in shouting louder that their remakes are better until any other view is forgotten (Taiwan's ""Infernal Affairs"" versus ""The Departed"" being a case in point), so Armand did better than Gervais there.

64753,"This dog film is amusing, but not because of the dog. Huey, the name of the dog who plays Sherlock, is not attractive and he can do little. His voice is also silly and under par. The reason why the film is amusing is because of the people. A very good casting choice of a ten year-old boy was made to be the lead in the film, Benjamin Eroen, who I see from IMDb never appeared in any other film. This is the only film ever directed by Richard Harding Gardner, a British actor. (That would explain why the dog in the film speaks with a Scottish accent.) The film is entirely set and filmed on location on Santa Catalina Island, or simply Catalina Island as it is generally called, which is off the coast of California. It must be the only film ever made there. The island today has a population of less than 4000 people, is 22 miles long and 8 miles wide at its widest point. It is one of eight islands in a chain which constitute the Channel Islands of California. These islands have many examples of unique flora and fauna. Perhaps because I have always wanted to visit those islands since I was a teenager, but never found the opportunity to do so, I found this film so interesting, as it shows a good deal of the island and satisfied some of my curiosity about the place. The island atmosphere of people living in a place cut off from the outside world in many ways is well conveyed. It is an 'everybody knows everybody' place, and they are always interesting to visit. It used to be possible to go to those islands to eat abalone, long ago before the California abalone were all fished out. However, abalone have now made a seasonal comeback in Paris, and at the correct time of year you can get a steaming dish heaped with the most wonderfully delicious abalone (called in French 'les Ormeaux') at the Dome Restaurant (formerly the famous café of the 1920s) in Montparnasse. The story of this film is incredibly silly and nonsensical, as are some of the characters. But that is all clearly intentional. Some rather silly 'baddies' are engaged in drug smuggling, though who their customers could possibly be is vague, to say the least. Sherlock is a police dog who talks, and he becomes separated from the detective who is trying to arrest the smugglers. He is rescued by the little boy, who is delighted to discover that the dog talks, but only to him. Yes, that is all completely ridiculous, I know, and there are no special effects to aid the movement of the dog's mouth as there are in contemporary talking dog movies. So it cannot be said that there is anything in the film that is remotely convincing. You just have to be willing to watch a movie where everything is simply silly. What a silly fellow I must be, as I enjoyed the movie.",negative,movie
64908,"Perhaps it is because I have seen so many truly bad movies but I just don't see this movie as a completely horrible one. It at least has some entertainment value in it, though the movie still remains an incredible badly done one.The movie has a sort of amateur feel to it, which isn't that surprising, since it got made by a whole bunch of people who had never worked in the industry before. It's as if a bunch of friends said; 'hey, let's shoot a ninja movie!' and somehow managed to get all the resources and people together to pull it off. The directing, the writing, the editing, the music, the acting, it's all really below par and quite clumsily at times but the movie does manage to still bring some entertainment. It's not a boring movie, mostly since its one that's always on the move with its main characters.Not that it's a spectacular movie to watch action-wise especially if you're expecting lots of ninja fights but there is still enough action in it. In a way this movie reminded me of a lot of '70's exploitation action flicks, set in a random Southern town, in which a stranger arrives in town and gets in trouble with the local rednecks. The movie even looks like an '70's movie, though I highly doubt this was intentional. It all has to do with its obvious very low budget they had to work with.It's a very silly movie, mostly due to its simplistic script. The way things progress and get build up are all highly unlikely. It also doesn't really make the characters any strong ones but that doesn't really matter since the movie doesn't even really feature real actors in it. Craig Boyett and David Lord were probably only cast because they knew some moves and Janet Pawlak, who runs like a pregnant aging chimp, probably got cast because she was willing to take her shirt off. The movie its premise might sounds promising to some (an American ninja fighting a bunch of KKK members) but the movie itself doesn't really know what to do with its own concept. Still I think if you're into the this ninja stuff and in particular the true philosophy behind it you will be able to appreciate this movie much better than most people are able to.It's a bad movie but not one without its entertainment value luckily.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",negative,movie

Special effects were also overly abused and you'll find yourself growing tired of them over time, especially the whole drippy-black spirit character. Sound is poor, appearing to be shot with a tin-can mic. Finally, the acting was just so over done it was ridiculous. The actors seemed to think they were performing in some type of stage play instead of on film, sometimes yelling their parts and always massively over-doing it.I really wanted to like this film, but all seemed to be lost in so many different ways.

As they come face to face with the creature they are forced to tangle with a ruthless treasure-hunting mobster (Jack Scalia), who will stop at nothing to steal the treasure.While the BC locations are great and the squid looks pretty good for low-budget CGI, the acting of the protagonists is too flat and the villain is overly cartoony. Fitness model Pratt comes off as a more buff Kate Hudson, but doesn't do much for me. Michal Yannai as Sally is equally blasé. The stunning Nicole McKay is on hand as the heavy's babe for all of 20 seconds.

I'll give it some credit, Jeff Denton is quite good as the villain and it is not too cheap visually having some decent scenery and effects and the editing is not as choppy as feared. On the other hand, the dialogue is horrendously bad, the characters are undeveloped clichés and the story is painfully predictable and severely lacking in any kind of suspense. The rapes and gore are nowhere near harrowing enough, with too much of the former and not enough of the latter. The ending is far too jumpy and rushed and doesn't feel rounded off satisfactorily. Apart from Denton, the acting is poor, I didn't get any sense of terror from either of the women.

Indeed if this movie had been the first of its kind, there would even have been a few laudable things to comment on -- the unrelentingly dark and creepy remote laboratory, a suitably vicious creature which kills in gory fashion (and looks like they spent a little money creating) etc. But as it is, its just one cliché after another.

Been there, done that, only ""Caged Fury"" has a twist, one that you'll decipher quickly enough on your own, and spend the rest of the movie wondering why the ""prisoners"" never catch on (the movie's explanation: women are stupid). Also, it stars Erik Estrada.Our heroines are a pair of Utah farm girls, Cat (Roxanna Micheals) and Tracy (Elena Sahagan). Tracy is the wild sister, the one who ran off to New York and came back looking like a mad scientist's experiment to transform LaToya Jackson into Pia Zadora, but retaining a country gal's love of baseball caps and acid-wash denim. Despite their father's (Michael Parks) misgivings, Cat wants to follow in her big sister's footsteps, only she wants to go to L.A. instead of New York because she's independent that way. As she heads west in her Taurus station wagon she's flagged down by Rhonda (April Dawn Dollarhide), a hitch-hiker fending off a fat hick rapist. Though Rhonda has no stated itinerary, she has a contact in L.A., ""fashion"" photographer Buck (Blake Bahner). Girls may go for Buck's studly good looks, but they stay for his charming style, such as when he asks his guest from Utah: ""Cat, as in p—sy?""

But just when Cat's about to catch on that she's auditioning for—gasp!—a porn video, she and Rhonda are booked on solicitation charges and sent to prison. Lucky for Cat, her big sister Tracy's got her back. Unfortunately, Tracy's not any smarter than she is, since Tracy's plan entails getting sent to the same prison and, well, she hasn't quite worked out all the details. Guess it's up to Estrada and Barathy, the only decent men in all of L.A., to save them. Uh-oh, Estrada gets shot and spends the last act in an ambulance being tended to by a sexy nurse. So it's Barathy, with his lethal kick-boxing skills and luxurious mullet, who finally takes down the bad guys. But first, how about some lesbianism, hot showers and a cameo from Ron Jeremy?

There is evidence it's trying to be a parody in the vein of ""Reform School Girls,"" but its humor makes the women, not the genre, the butt of the joke. What's more, ""Caged Fury"" has no deliciously campy performances. Ty Randolph, as the dominatrix-outfitted warden, does what she can but she's no Pat Ast or Sybil Danning; and Ron Jeremy and Erik Estrada, who have lent camp cache to other direct-to-video projects, are given little to do here. ""Caged Fury"" also doesn't cut it as exploitation. Director Bill Milling has several adult video credits (""A Scent of Heather,"" ""Blonde Goddess""), but with ""Caged Fury"" he stays safely inside the confines of an R-rating, not even daring to push into ""hard-R"" territory. Yeah, you get your T&A, some full-frontal glimpses and some violence (a fork in the eyeball being the goriest set-piece), but the sex is so tame it's not even worth mentioning. A guy who directed hardcore porn skimps on the sex scenes? Guess Milling wanted people to see him as something other than a porn director, but sometimes it's best to stick with what you know.",negative,movie
66406,"There's something scary about electricity. No not that there happens to be a serial killer flowing through the current as in this movie. No I'm talking more about how it's all around us. How we depend on it almost every second of our lives and we never become detached from it from birth to death. Of course, this flick doesn't touch on any of that. Nope it's just this silly dead psychopath who strikes out from beyond the grave.He works in a computer store and picks his targets based on who he comes into contact with there. So when this woman shows up asking about a computer and accidentally leaves her day planner there she becomes his next target. It's here where things take the twist because he ends up getting electrocuted and his consciousness gets jacked into the electrical system (the how's and why's never drawn upon) and he's still out to kill that lady, her son, anyone around them ... you get the picture.But it never works because frankly, the whole thing isn't very scary. Outside of one cool makeup bit, I was bored to tears. There ain't much in the way of atmosphere either and it's dated view of computers, the internet and VR circa early 90's is just downright laughable particularly because the whole story verges on these elements as it coasts along. How about more variety in the scenes too? I know he's going to try to reach out from the grave ... using electricity ... um okay, but when he kills a stereotypical blond airhead babysitter - as only found in movies of these sorts - that does nothing for me.Ghost In The Machine. So utterly boring and predictable. Why I didn't turn it off I'll never know. Perhaps I thought it was going to get better? Well it never did. If only the killer could have taken me out with a zap as I went to put this tape into my VCR. Unfortunately I got to waste those ninety minutes of my life I'll never get back.",negative,movie
66707,"To sum up this movie in one word: Silly.I watched it because it stars Jet Li, and because Corey Yuen is the action director. I knew of the super low score, but I thought, since Corey Yuen is involved, it at least has to have some decent fighting..? And it does. Sort of. Corey Yuen has worked with Jet Li and Jason Statham several times, (directed the first Transporter-movie) he is excellent, so I wanted to check this out.Anyhow. The movie is a comedy, think Kung Fu Hustle, only not funny. Basically it's like a cartoon. With cartoony sound effects, very weird ""physics"", and so on. It's just silly, like one time: someone is punched way up in the clouds by a tiny woman, and everybody laughs. Weird.The best thing about the movie though, is still the fights. Doesn't have that much fighting, but the fights are entertaining. Full of silliness, but still fun to watch. A little heavy on stupid looking wire-work, though.Also there's a lot of good, fake-looking mostly, but good use of CGI. Windows breaking, dents in cars, cracks and bullet-holes in walls, that sort of thing, and it actually really adds to the action. Destruction is always good in action-movies. But, even with some decent fighting, and big use of CGI, it is still not very good. The story is, well, I didn't really catch the story, as I watched minutes at a time, because let me tell ya, when it's no action going on, it's pretty boring. And it's stupid.",negative,movie

If you are looking for a deep discussion afterward, this wouldn't be the one to watch. I'd use it as a warmup during the lights on, gulping the beers or wine coolers, joking around, tossing pillows and chowing down on some messy snacks before the real movie starts time period. I'm not telling you what it's about because you already read that before scrolling down to the reviews.

It feels like a parody of a western because all the stereotypical elements are there but it treats itself seriously. That's why some will like it and others completely hate it so it makes it difficult to recommend to anyone.I personally found the clothes and sets a little distracting because everything felt slightly wrong for pre-1900. The low budget probably limited what could be custom made so you just have to overlook it. The music was also wrong in a few places, some points have an almost comical tone and don't match the situation.If you are the type to get bothered by details then this movie would be difficult to get through, otherwise it's a good average western themed movie.

67603,"My 4/10 might even be generous, but there were one or two Ok fight scenes.This movie is incredibly poorly written and poorly acted. This is really the kind of thing we'd see on a direct-to-DVD release if that's even still a thing. It's like someone watched every bad action movie made in the last 10 or 20 years and just used all those same clichés.I could forgive that if there were a lot of great action and the badly acted dramatic parts were brief. Unfortunately that's not really the case. There is surprisingly little action in this film, and most of it is actually involving guns. I think this is being marketed as more of a martial arts flick in the vein of The Raid, but that's not really representative of what we get here. Like I said there are literally one or two decent fight scenes but even some of the fight choreography in the other scenes is not very convincing. This might have passed muster 30 years ago but especially with what has happened in the martial arts genre in the last 10 years or so, the bar is much higher now for realism and brutality. Most of the stuff in this film just feels weak by comparison.The best thing I can say about this film is that Christine Reyes is incredibly hot. But that's not enough reason to watch what is otherwise an unfortunately bad movie. I literally found myself just skipping all the dialog sections for the last half of the movie because it was so cringe-worthy. I'm sorry, I hate giving bad reviews but with this one I feel compelled to.",negative,movie

The two people that Adam Copeland, aka Lucas Nolad, are lame. First, they want him then they don't then they use again and then send home. Then there are the parts where the prisoner, Vasit, is handcuffed then not cuffed. The fight scenes are good and I only saw one WWE wrestling move.All in all, The acting gets a 6 but I give the movie a 4 because it could have been written better.

67672,"TRAPPED ASHES is a very low budget anthology horror made in the same style as DR TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS or CREEPSHOW. It has an admirably old-fashioned feel to it, but unfortunately the constraints of budget and general cheesiness of the execution means that it disappoints rather than innovates throughout.Unusually enough for a horror anthology, the best part of the film is the wraparound segment. This is directed by Joe Dante, who can't resist throwing in some old timers like his beloved Dick Miller and Henry Gibson (THE BURBS), who acts as a tour guide showing a group around an old haunted house. The stories that take place are as follows: The first, THE GIRL WITH GOLDEN BREASTS, is an awful bad taste joke about a woman whose breast enlargement operation goes awry. This one's directed by Ken Russell, who also cameos, and it's terrible from beginning to end. The second, JIBAKU, is directed by Friday THE 13TH's Sean S. Cunningham and is a Japanese-set ghost story. Sadly, the events that play out are entirely predictable, although Ryo Ishibashi (SUICIDE CLUB) bags a small role.The third story, STANLEY'S GIRLFRIEND, arouses some mild interest by tackling the weighty subject of Stanley Kubrick, but it turns out to be routine despite the welcome presence of old-timer John Saxon. The final story, MY TWIN, MY WORM, is another bad taste story and the title tells you everything you need to know about that. I only really enjoyed TRAPPED ASHES for seeing the three old-time actors on-screen but the young cast members are very poor here and the directors appear to be slumming it. It's a pity.",negative,movie
67926,"I watched this film because it seemed to be a remake/homage to Moby Dick. Well, if Moby Dick is one of the most iconic novels of all time, this film is a washed up mess.B movie sci-fi films are notoriously bad. They either are so low budget at they are silly, or they come from an Aliens rip off. Beyond White Space is bad for altogether different reasons - a total lack of story telling.Lets start with what I did enjoy. The effects are better than I expected, the cast is likeable... that's about it.What is wrong is a total lack of continuity, the ability to build a story, logic of characters or actions or payoff.The main plot (for no one could count the number of extra sub plots floating around this film) is that an ancient space creature needs to be hunted for some reason; and space pirates are in there somewhere, and space cops? After this, I stopped caring very quickly. The film just does not make sense, and what is even worse is that it becomes anti climactic.Aside from the total lack of plot, story telling and logic, it is actually not the worse film I have seen so far in 2019, so there is that going for it. I mean, you have been warned, but at least it isn't a very long film. I did give it a 4, so it's only bad. Go chase that whale!",negative,movie

It has a quite classy style, an interesting atmosphere and, last but not least, the beautyful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme doesn´t make you crying by his acting, he does a relatively good job.

I've watched its first episode trying to hold on any thread worth following up, any dialog, anything really. But all I see is a sequence of images or people saying things taken from a check- list based on statistics from the content of good shows by people not understanding what made these good.If in a couple of years, I learn shows like these were made by an artificial intelligence in training, I would not be surprised at all.

68134,"On the one hand, I liked that, for what seems like the first time since The New World Malick has actors as characters in scenes where they, you know, have dialog exchanges and we get to see how they interact and learn about each other. It's not a lot of the time, but it shows that when Malick sat down with the actors and, whether it was improvised or not, got them to figure out how these people would talk to one another, whatever shades (or not) of depth there would be - and this isn't just the main cast but, say, small scenes between Mara's Faye and Faye's father, or BV (Gosling) with his mother, or any of Patti Smith's scenes - it's a joy to see these actors work off one another. If Malick had actually been working from a script, as opposed to no script at all, he might have had one of his best films.On the other hand, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I may be getting tired of ""Chivo"" Lubezki's cinematography, at least in this case after so many Malick films. It's a strange thing to say since when one sees The New World or especially The Tree of Life, they're nothing short of photographic tour-de-forces, things that we haven't seen in cinematic grammar before as far as how he uses the lenses and the natural light, at least in such a way as it is. But while he has the good instinct sometimes to push in or pull out on an actor when they're talking, and of course the light through (there are a lot of) windows, or outside, is beautiful (it can't help but be anything but and there's no synonyms left for it), I kind of wished there wasn't such a hodge-podge of technical approaches here. And meanwhile on the one hand this is a film that has Iggy Pop, Flea and Patti Smith in cameos (and Smith even gets to have something like a character, probably more than Holly Hunter or Cate Blanchett probably), and it certainly captures the Austin music scene with vitality and energy and gets how it's intoxicating to see the audience and to be so close to the stage or backstage and, to another extent, hanging around Michael Fassbender (who, despite working without a script net, shows why he's so good as an actor first, movie star second, understanding how to just be in a room looking and listening can have weight). Also all of the main cast have insanely good chemistry together, both physically and mentally (mostly physically), and I think Gosling and Mara are a good fit for a Malick world.On the other hand, this line: ""I don't like to see the birds in the sky because I'll miss you"" or this line ""Mercy was a word. I never thought I needed it."" Yeah.And, on top of the narration which is, mostly here, the absolute worst that Malick's had in his films - some of it's laughable, other times it's horrible, and even in Knight of Cups I didn't feel this way, though to an extent I did with 'Wonder' - I felt bad for actors in the second half of the movie who seemed adrift, maybe with more character material on the cutting room floor (there's another *six hours* of this), like Blanchett or Berenice Marlohe. Both of these women play the love interests of the respective Gosling and Mara characters after they split up (why they do would both take too long and not be worth the effort for its simplicity), but even compared to everyone else I didn't get a sense of who they were as people.I'm not talking about this as if it's a problem as far as something intentional that a filmmaker does where they leave some mystery with the people and we have to read into things (with Faye, I think Mara actually does a whole lot with a little, at least from what we can see, and her performance came the closest to making me care about a character on screen - I thought almost the same could've been for Portman's Rhonda, but she leaves the film for so long stretches I forgot that her conflict was so shallow, but I digress). What I mean is more that I had no idea why the two ex-lovebirds would go with these people, what they mean to them, what they do for them, and why Blanchett's character becomes so sad for not much reason (BV's mother warns him off of her at one point because... she's sad, that's it), and Marlohe gets even less.So with Song to Song, I know it sounds like I'm coming down on it harshly, but it's because I expect a great deal from this director, and want him to do well. The problem though in general is that at 129 minutes it feels too long, which is a strange thing to note considering that there's, I must stress, SIX OTHER HOURS of footage, so I'm not sure if it could use being like 20 even 30 minutes shorter, or another hour longer or so. There's scenes that get surprisingly close to the emotional depths that Malick could get at back in his prime 70's days with his actors, and they're game for making a romance film full of highs and lows. But the more ""Malick"" touches with how memories and impressions and nature and the city of Austin and who knows what else blends in with the story is hit or miss at best and distractingly precious and bad at worst (I probably neglected to write down other glaringly dumb lines).",negative,movie
68219,"Writers David Guion and Michael Handelman and director Jesse Peretz must have called in a lot of favors when they made ""The Ex,"" for how else to account for the presence of Zach Braff, Amanda Peet, Jason Bateman, Charles Grodin, Mia Farrow, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen, Paul Rudd and Amy Adams in as slight an indie comedy as the one they have manufactured here? And ""manufactured"" is definitely the operative term in this case, for ""The Ex"" feels contrived and phony from the get-go.After he gets fired from his job as a chef in an upscale Manhattan restaurant, Tom Reilly (Braff) moves with his wife and infant son back to her hometown in Ohio where he gets a job at the same ad agency where his father-in-law (Grodin) works. One of the employees, Chip (Bateman), an old flame of Tom's wife, Sofia (Peet), tries to sabotage Tom at every turn, undercutting him at work and trying to rekindle the romance between Sofia and himself.""The Ex"" fails on a variety of levels, but the primary one is that, while it is supposed to be a satire of small town, middle American values, most of the characters - with their New-Age quirkiness and bohemian eccentricities - seem as if they'd be more at home living in some converted loft in Soho than on a tree-lined street in suburban Ohio. The setting of ""The Ex"" doesn't feel like Anyplace, USA; in fact, it doesn't feel like anyplace, period, except maybe the fantasy world of two overpaid Hollywood screenwriters. Add to this an assortment of unappealing and unappetizing characters, a tendency towards sitcom-level humor and plotting, and an over-reliance on heavy-handed slapstick and sight gags, and you have one of the major comedy disappointments of 2007. Braff is definitely a talented actor, but ""The Ex"" is a career path misfire that should be mercifully forgotten",negative,movie
68350,"A few weeks ago, they re-released The Jungle Book on Disney DVD and I watched it after not seeing it for years and I just forgot how much I loved it. I saw that it had a sequel and I figured it might be worth a look. I watched it tonite and even though it wasn't a bad attempt, it was not really necessary to make it. The first Jungle Book ended so well and had a perfect happy ending, this was just a strange continuation on the story. They do bring back our favorite characters which I loved, like the snake, he's so cheesy, but he always cracks me up. Bagera, the panther, once again, I just love him, he tries to do right all the time, but he always gets hurt in the process. And of course Baloo is always there to bring some life and fun to the story with the simple bare necessities.Maugli is living in the village with a new family and life. But it's not the life he's always wanted, it has work and rules. He tells the other kids about the jungle, but they don't believe on how fun it is. Baloo and Bagera are in the jungle and Baloo just misses Maugli so much and brings him back to the jungle. But they're in big trouble, Shanti and her little brother(children from Maugli's village) follow Maugli and they are all being followed by Sher Kahn who wants revenge on Maugli for making a fool out of him.The Jungle Book 2 is a cute Disney sequel, but for those who love the original, it doesn't hold a candle up to the first Jungle Book. But for the kids and just a regular family film for the afternoon. I have to admit that there was a scene that definitely made me laugh, when the snake sees Shanti and tries to eat her, but her little brother beats him up, pretty good too, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. There are some fun moments, so it's worth a look, but I do of course prefer the first Jungle Book.4/10",negative,movie
68580,"The fact that The Ladies Man originated from a skit on Saturday Night Live should surprise no one who has seen and disliked the film. The film feels exactly like a character who belongs in skits roughly five to eight minutes long, who will occasionally say something funny in those five to eight minutes, and then end on a comic-bang before the screenwriter decides to cut over to another sketch. The sad thing about The Ladies Man is it focuses on its title character (played by a clearly inspired Tim Meadows) for eighty long, often tedious minutes, completely deluding the character's comic effect because it must be referenced with almost every line he says.I've discussed how tedious and often frustratingly unfunny Saturday Night Live films can often be (I wrote a whole blog on it three years back, so that should give an idea of how opinionated I was). Their main complaint links most of their films (with notable exceptions of the Wayne's World titles) in that they have difficultly giving their character's antics enough to do for a film's runtime. ""The Ladies Man"" character already has enough energy to be in a eighty minute film, but does he have the humor, plot, and charisma capabilities of carrying such precious minutes? How far does a sexist, afro-rockin' radio host go? The answer is not very far, but the film is at least buoyed by the competence and appeal of Tim Meadows, who can do no wrong in films as far as I'm concerned. His presence is casual and his attitude often laidback, even when he's playing a character as tiresome as this one. He plays Leon ""The Ladies Man"" Phelps, a studly black radio host who is known for his outspoken sexism on air during his nighttime show where he gives female callers shallow advice about relationships. The first thirty minutes of the film show his attitude and serve as nothing but a showcase for redundant jokes akin to that of modern Saturday Night Life sketches.When the story finally does get going, it's lame and serves more as filler than as a significant plot. It follows a man who finds his wife cheating on him, only to spot a naked black man running outside his home with a smiley face tattooed on his rear. Turns out, there is a website dedicated to finding this man and a group of angry husbands meet up to try and track down the man who pleasures their wives. The result is a tiresome array of unfunny marital jokes and a predictable but slightly catchy song and dance number.Tim Meadows (who serves as co-write on this film) is clearly inspired when playing ""The Ladies Man."" His personality is always energetic and here he plays a character he completely created and ""perfected"" himself. There is a genuine sense of fun and comfortableness when playing this role. The issue is that ""The Ladies Man"" is so thin and uninteresting as a character that he's more of an idea. In that regard, Meadows does a great job at playing an idea.I return full circle to my point that I made in the beginning that stated that the films focuses on a character that feels exactly like he belongs in concise skits on Television. It's no surprise that after about fifteen minutes of laughing with and at the character, I began to be burdened with feelings of tedium. This only influences my point that a character with this personality belongs in shorts seventy-five minutes shorter than the film The Ladies Man.Starring: Tim Meadows, Karyn Parsons, Billy Dee Williams, John Witherspoon, Will Ferrell, and Eugene Levy.

So when someone writes, for a film, we expect something fresh, not refresh or repetition.It was a common platform. That's about a local legend.

How much they succeed and the rest of the tale follows with a twist before the end.The same initiation, build up and conclusion as any horror film. Watchable film, but not any good.

He's solid in every role but everything else is so generic that you regret even spending time on this.Why does he allow himself be mostly filler actor these days?

69169,"A young beautiful woman (Michelle Williams) is trapped in an empty marriage tucked away in an ugly apartment block in London. Her pride and joy in her grey existence is her 4-year-old son. One day, as the two of them are at the football match, she seduces a slick journalist Jasper (Ewan McGregor) in the local pub. As fate would have it, they are locked in a lovers embrace, with the football match raging on behind them on TV, when the stadium going up in flames with a series of explosions. Her husband and son are both killed in the terrorist attack, leaving her broken and alone.If you are now thinking that a film about the aftermath of a major terrorist attack from the director of Brigit Jones' Diary sounds like a recipe for disaster, then you are partly right. But it is not bad for the reason you might think. The film is, for the most part, an emotional roller- coaster - you could be crying your way through most of it. But not because of her grieving for her lost family. The bombs are just the beginning - she still has to endure a full load of unlikely events in the hour to come. She understandably loses it along the way as the story becomes so over-dramatised that it is just ridiculous (especially when you run the story back in your head afterwards).Towards the end she enters a phase of grief hallucination and reconciliation with life. As the movie is neither funny nor exciting, this should have been the route to take all along. Concentrating on the mourning of the young mother, and perhaps even throwing in some guilt towards her semi-estranged husband. Her husband is just gone with his death. He is not missed nor is there any regret for his disappearance. Even for a semi-estranged husband this sounds a little harsh - she did worry about him, after all, so she must have felt something. It is also curious that they have no family, or friends who drop by to comfort her. A lonely marriage must have pushed them into some kind of a social circle, or a hobby, or at least the occasional phone call with their mothers. Was their life really that lonely.The movie is clearly intended as a pamphlet against terrorism, by showing the human cost at the level of ordinary people. It also takes the time to ""explain"" the resilience of London in a voice-over. It is a little desperate to save a movie through nationalism, but can actually be fit in here, although it could have been better prepared, by, for instance, by making her a more integral part of London. This is no masterpiece, nor an entertainment jewel, and can easily be missed altogether. A pity, because it does have some potential.",negative,movie
69282,"The Houses October Built is about a group of five friends who rent an RV and go on a road trip on the search for the most extreme haunted houses in America.The Houses October Built is from the same crew that made the documentary-horror film with the same title in 2011. This time writers Bobby Roe and Zack Andrews, who also star in the film with Roe directing, get the assistance from group outsider Jason Zada and morph the original premise into a purely fictional horror. The 2014 movie utilizes the premise of documenting and researching the world of haunted houses, in which 30 million people visit in October, but along the way the terror takes a turn.The Houses October Built has one of the most believable group dynamic of friends, probably because the actors really are friends in real life. Mikey Roe, Bobby's real brother, Jeff Larson and Brandy Schaefer all round out the group of the docu-crew again in the 2014 film. The group dynamic is so realistic, in fact, that unfortunately the film lacks any foreshadowing emotion for looming terror, a must in any horror film. The chemistry is quite entertaining, luckily, because by the thirty minute mark the scares are scarce.Not having seen the 2011 film I highly doubt they improved upon it with this 'remake'. The Houses October Built is fun and light but ultimately the frights never come because the haunts never quite pass from fake to real to be truly scary.For more FULL reviews of RECENT releases, check out our website.",negative,movie

69691,"The story starts off promising, with a realistic looking prison scene and the protagonist being released. He goes home to a not too goofy looking white trash family, and the set up for a good story (or narrative in today's lingo) is arranged. Problem is, the story quickly becomes confusing. The acting is good, scenery not too phony, but it's just tough to figure out what is going on.We are introduced to the protagonists parents, as well as some gnarly looking people from the past. However, the blanks are never filled in. The Mom is really down on the main guys behavior, but we are not sure why. Was he a sociopath who deserved her wrath? Or is he an OK guy with a loony mother? There are also some obnoxious ""bad guy"" looking and acting characters, but we never really know if they are valid when they beat up the main character, or if they are just evil. This is the sort of film that looks like they had the cash to hire some good actors and directors, then ran out of money before they could hire a writer. What they end up doing is the old ""FOR THE CHILDREN"" routine. He is desperately trying to find his daughters, whom he has not seen since before prison, and give them all of his money.We are suppose to believe that if a man can only have that one more meeting with his daughters, that he will be complete and fulfilled, even if he is never allowed to see them again. He explains this to his father, who believes he is not even deserving of this. What? a guy is so evil he is not even allowed to give some cash to his daughters? Yea, right. Even our society doesn't believe a guy is too evil to give money. It goes with the new Hollywood mantra ""women and kids can do whatever they want, men don't matter"".",negative,movie

A glib, celebratory tone underpins what commences as a run-of-the-mill romcom, before the plot starts to venture into more unorthodox territory. But the film never really dares to take sides, and a weak conclusion suggests that all the tastier material should be reconsidered just as part of the froth. The result is an odd film, with all the flaws of a feel-good movie, but which doesn't actually make you feel good in the end.",negative,movie

70568,"F*UGLY, the name seems unusual and hatke, I kept wondering what it really meant, well the beginning credits clarifies the same; it meant ""FIGHT AGAINST INJUSTICE"". The hatke quotient stops in the name itself.So Fugly delves in the latest trend of exploring our Capital Delhi. The story is of 5 friends, Dev (debutant Mohit Marwah), Devi (debutant Kiara Advani), Gaurav (Boxer Vijendra Singh) and Aditya alias Haggu (Arfi Lamba), who lead a chilled and care free life. In one incident wherein Devi is molested by a grocery shop owner and the friends decide to teach him a lesson and kidnap him and en-route they have an accident with a police van and they meet Police Inspector Choutala (Jimmy Shergill). This incident changes their life forever and Choutala starts blackmailing them and how these friends fight against Choutala and the system constitutes the rest of the story.The first problem is the story by Rahul Handa which is Rang De Basanti Meets Fukrey,it hangs between being comedy or a serious issue based movie and does not have the punch. The second problem is with the screenplay which is slow and the sequences look too half baked and without the punch and the transition from flash back to present looks disjointed. The songs have no relevance to the story and look forced. And the biggest is the climax which does not justify the overall narration. The dialogues by director Kabir Sadanand and Rajveer Ahuja ranges from being witty to unintentionally funny. The characters look too monotonous and repeated.Performance wise it needed more punch from the debutants, Mohit Marwah as Dev looks too stiff and needs diction lessons as his dialogues are not clear. Boxer Vijendra Singh sleep walks through his role of Gaurav and is average as the fun loving Jat. Kiara Advani as Devi is crackling and justifies her character well and she shines amongst the other debutants Mohit and Vijendra, watch out for this girl. Arfi Lamba as Aditya becomes quite monotonous after a point and his comedy tracks look forced. Jimmy Shergill as R S Choutala is the bright spot of Fugly, he is just superb and rises above the writing with his brilliant portrayal, another under rated actor of Bollywood. Rest of the cast sleep walk through their portrayal.Another problem is the editing by Shounok Ghosh, it is not crisp and overall flow looks bumpy. Cinematography by Milind Jog is good and captures Delhi & Ladakh well.The Music by Yo Yo Honey Singh sounds repetitive and other music directors Raftaar and Prashant Vadhyar does not impress.Kabir Sadanand took a topical subject but fails in the narration, it neither falls into the category of serious cinema nor a comedy. Kabir also stumbles is extracting a crackling performances by the cast excluding for Jimmy Shergill and Kiara Advani.",negative,movie
70619,"I just have to comment on this movie because I gave it a 4 rating, and in my opinion that's pretty high for a softporn smut movie.  The actual plot is kind of hokey (who would expect otherwise) but Hafron is so incredibly funny, and he delivers everything in a cyborgish voice so it's easy for him. Whoever wrote the script had some wit definitely!  I must have laughed out loud ten times, and that's not a reason anyone would pick up this movie. The only softporn movie I've seen which had any merit other than beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle is drop dead gorgeous...just look at the cover!)Any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is, also considering the movie wasn't made to artistically entertain, so to speak, it gets at least a four in my book.

Richard Grieco is a reasonably competent C grade actor but I didn't expect too much, I was quite surprised. For me this movie worked if you don't expect too much. I thought Angie Everhart was attractive and quite competent in her role and Richard Grieco was relatively believable in his role. The ending was pretty good and overall it was not a great movie, but one I would watch again. Some scenes were quite erotic and Ms Everharts nudity was worthwhile. Certainly better than most Shannon Tweed, Shannon Whirry offerings.",negative,movie

71044,"CONFESSIONS OF A DRIVING INSTRUCTOR is the third of the CONFESSIONS series, which start out with the surprisingly enjoyable CONFESSIONS OF A WINDOW CLEANER. Sadly, this film is far from enjoyable: it's saddled with a rubbish script, peppered with dumb jokes and scenarios which simply rehash those that have come before.The main cast are all present and correct, but it really is a case of ever decreasing circles this time around. Robin Askwith tries his best as a cheeky chappy whose attempts at the titular career get him embroiled in all manner of sexual shenanigans, but his schtick is wearing thin by now. Anthony Booth is relegated to the sidelines, and Bill Maynard barely gets a cameo.Better are Windsor Davies as the villain of the piece and George Layton as his gloriously un-PC sidekick Bender, who ends up being the butt of some homophobic humour. The film also includes an early role for Lynda Bellingham as the film's romantic interest, although her performance is hardly great; better are veteran players Liz Fraser and Irene Handl who have some funny scenes between them. Sadly, such effective moments of humour are few and far between in what is overall a lacklustre movie.",negative,movie
71100,"Another goody cool Vagabond hero like umpteen Tamil movies. And he falls for a fair maiden college girl. Situations conveniently conjures up to make girl meet boy (accident, phone misplaced etc as per the imagination- seems like script was written during shooting itself) and boy get close to girl, make friends etc. The usual drill. Without reading too much, one can still see how subtly the movie promotes stalking women, treating the wooing of women as some commodity etc and glorifying it as a love story. This continuously happens in almost every Tamil movie (unless it is a psycho movie, which is another issue). The roadside romeo being projected as cool kid who is just making passes at girls in public places with his sidekicks. In fact, here Simbu's character proudly flaunts this aspect in the climax of the movie. The positive part of the movie is Simbu's one-man show, where he somehow manages to keep the proceedings from falling apart totally. Giving him good company is Santhanam as the sidekick, with his trademark comedy. Also, the director tries to add some flair to mostly ordinary scenes. For example, even in climax, any potboiling action or fights are eschewed and the end is relatively quiet in sync with the overall tone of the movie.Overall, there isn't really much to rave about. This is a Simbu show all the way. If you are his fan, you would love it. For others, it may be a drag.",negative,movie
71123,"If it wasn't for Boris Karloff, I probably would not have seen Voodoo Island. After seeing it, I do think that Karloff is the best thing about Voodoo Island, he has given far better performances but he brings a lot of class and command to his role. Elisha Cook is also good, the music is haunting and adds successfully to the sense of danger and dread and the ending is kind of creepy. Very little else works however. The cinematography is not so bad, it is sharp and looks decent enough, it's just that there isn't much that is particularly memorable and little special is done with it. The plants to put it kindly do look stupid and have absolutely nothing to do with the story or title(which was quite misleading). They don't serve much of a purpose either, they don't have much personality and the deaths(quite a low body count here) are utterly forgettable. The script and story were the biggest flaws. There is far too much talk in the script and in quality it is flimsy and has little flow. I'd forgive the slow pacing if the story and atmosphere were compelling enough. Sadly though they are not, the lack of thrills, suspense or genuine horror as well as the fact that little of it makes sense made Voodoo Island a chore to sit through in all honesty. The lesbian subplot was surprising but I am not sure whether it merged with the rest of the story or whether it was out of place and stuck out like a sore thumb, by all means it holds interest value but it leans towards the latter for me. The characters are severely underdeveloped, playing second fiddle to everything else, so we have no time to care for or even like them. Apart from Karloff and Cook, the rest of the cast don't register. And I do agree about the voodoo issue, there is little of it so you do feel that the title and story bear no relevance to one another, and the fact that the film seems to think that it occurred in the Pacific rather than the Caribbean(not nit-picking at all, this is common knowledge) is rather disturbing. I've seen MST3K mentioned here and I also agree, there are worse films that have been torn to shreds on that show but I think MST3K would think of some good material talking about Voodoo Island. Overall, not as bad as its rep but despite two good performances, a good score and the ending Voodoo Island is pretty bad. 4/10 Bethany Cox",negative,movie
71249,"This is a movie about nothing. That's fine for a half-hour episode of Seinfeld, because it's amusing and entertaining. This movie is neither. It's humorless, tedious and somewhat painful to watch.I like slice-of life movies. I don't need action. I don't need anything to really happen as long as I experience something I normally wouldn't experience in everyday life. This movie is anyone's very ordinary everyday life with some amount of coincidence and absurdity added. Rather than creating interest, though, these devices only prevent anything genuine from emerging.Only one of the two main characters is believable, and both lack color and depth. That's a serious flaw in a movie where almost nothing happens. A transformation of sorts does take place, but it feels contrived. The events leading up to the transformation don't in any way suggest that it should occur, or why.I'm giving the movie 4 out of 10 because someone might get something from it, and because there are a few brief moments that I liked. Also, the acting is at least adequate.The movie is inferior, but not horrible. Observing everyday life on a long walk would be a better way to spend 90 minutes, though.",negative,movie

First to all, It's not an origin story. The movie only center on some random facts about Tom Riddle. Most of the film we see some generic Howard students debating about Tom and Soviet Wizards (yes, soviet soldiers in a Harry Potter movie) questioning the main character.With all that said, the plot is not the worst part. The film is full of awkward close up shot of the character's mouth or eyes while they are reacting to stuff. I know that it was made by amateurs but I've better film with lower budget, the problem is not the money, it's the lack of vision and knowledge of the Harry Potter universe.

71454,"So so film has a really strong performance from ""Modern Family's"" Ty Burrell to recommend it for but sadly not much else to really separate it from the pack of the other high school kid comes of age in boarding school films out there. Film's trailer promises a wacky comedy about a hippie like guy with a lot of goats and a lot of life lessons to impart but the film really more or less uses him as set dressing...which is a shame because David Duchovny is clearly having a good time and is quite game for whatever the script wants to throw at him and indeed he seems so ready for wackiness that we all but laugh the first time we see him because it looks for all the world that his character is going to be the real star of this movie and a real laugh getter--but aside from having him duel with ex Weeds star Justin Kirk for the affections of a rather over the top Vera Farmiga the screenplay either can't or won't let Goat Man do much of anything else. The film's center is ""The Good Wife"" son Graham Phillips as a kid raised in the desert and finding his way in this boarding school--and befriending his roommate and finding a young woman and etc. The film's real star should've been Goat Man. I'm not saying that the film is lousy or even boring although it has some boring stretches, but its kind of slight, when the elements were clearly here for something really vivid and memorable. The film even has characters that it clearly doesn't know what to do with besides Goat Man and the crazy new age mom and the obnoxious boyfriend---there's also the tough chick who threatens to beat up Phillips at the beginning of the film, lives in the desert with Phillips and Goat Man and everyone and is taken under Vera famiga's wing in the middle of the film, but the film never gives her anything to do there's also Keri Russell (forever Felicity to me) who's character is given somewhat of a build-up but then once she gets introduced she's given nothing to do and is all but forgotten about from the rest of the film as well, which brings me back to Ty Burrell. He plays the much much hated father of Phillips' character. Vera Farmiga whom vastly overplays the new agey mother of Phillips' character (and is bravely unsympathetic here--meaning her character is very unlikable) has spent a good amount of her screen time bashing her ex-husband so when he finally shows up played by the dad from Modern Family--we're all ready to pretty much hate him--but the strong somewhat no nonsense portrayal by Burrell actually makes him the most likable character (not to mention the most level headed) in the entire movie. I thought his presence actually served to anchor the entire film itself--and his presence as a supporting character really served to help ground the whole movie itself into a reality that it was sorely lacking otherwise. Oh again its not that its a bad movie per se--but it should've been a lot better then it was.",negative,movie

The camera work wasn't awful, neither was the lighting, or sound. Sure, it looked low budget, but that isn't a huge problem.The acting/plot makes up for it. The acting in this is painful, and I can't imagine a worse actor then the guy playing Anus' father. One scene towards the start with Anus watching his cartoons (terrible CGI 3D animation that looked like a school project) while his dad tries to talk to him is more cringe worthy than a whole season of Curb Your Enthusiasm.The plot is some stupid crap as well, something to do with Anus making a deal with the devil to make him a ""beautiful man"", and now random people want to kill him. Between the scenes of porn, you forget just what the hell is happening.This is one real clusterf@ck of a movie, but that's what makes it so funny. If you can laugh at stupid things like awful acting, retarded characters, low budget gore (a small knife can take off a hand with one slash?!?!) and ridiculous scenarios, give Anus a chance.

I have never been a fan of Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna rag on people who are fans of these types of shows. Also, I will say that I did not hate this movie. I respect that a woman could break through and write a screenplay, even though starring in it shows a big ego, I believe. I'll admit at the beginning Joe Estevez scared the bejesus out of me. But during MST3K, I thought Crow's comments were hilarious! The best thing he said was, ""You may be wondering if I'm Martin Sheen. Well, I'm not.

In fact, the non-discriminating fantasy viewer may actually enjoy this one. This is kind of like a California Valley Girl version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND with a bit of THE WIZARD OF OZ thrown in filtered through a BLADE RUNNER-esquire setting with the train of events playing out rather like SPACEHUNTER but this movie isn't anywhere near as good as any of those. I have to admit I actually had fun watching this though it's just so outrageous and outlandish in its approach. The sets too prove surprisingly effective for a low budget movie. Plus I always get a kick out of the state controlled television announcements which prove incredibly transparent in their intent. While this is definitely not for everyone (it stars Kathy Ireland who's really no actress, borrows most of its plot from other movies and things always feel a little too safe and sure for our leads), there are those who might find enjoyment here although it's a little tough to explain why exactly.

So when I saw this DVD in a bargain bin I knew i had to snap it up. This film freaks you out in a totally different way. It starts as what seems to be a vanity project for its star and director, an ageing monster hunter with a very sad outfit and red cap. But theres this weird charm about the whole thing that just keeps you watching. It has the quality of an old tourism film abou the american woodlands. And there are actually a few effective moments, most noteably the finding of the decapitated animal and the approach of the beast as seen by the motion sensor computer. Is this where Aliens got its ideas from? Who knows?Theres a hilarious scene where the lead guy has to protect the others from a ""MAD DOG!"" which he shouts at the top of his voice. But what is cool in this is that he really messes it up and the young bloke their sorts it out. So the director doesnt totally see himself as the Dirty Harry of the woods.Watching it in its original form you cant help but find it trashy and daft. But theres a glint in the eye that elevates it.

This movie could have been good as the story in general is OK. The actors lines are cheesy and stupid. They make you feel like laughing. Also the makeup could have been a lot better as it looks fake. In one of the scenes their is an attack by a wolf and I don't know if you weren't supposed to see the wolf or what. The actiong was poor as well as they should have casted a real native American instead of a poor look alike.

One of the things I did like about it was that, in most every horror movie, the monster waits until each person is alone then kills them one by one.

It turns out the escaped killer from the original movie, Pitchfork (Dean), isn't really dead; and he's back to wreak more havoc, in southern Alabama. The Summers brothers, Steven (Ivy) and Corey (Sande), once again have to do battle with the madman. Steven also must, once again, protect his girlfriend, Amanda (Eakin); who's targeted by Pitchfork. Detective Loomis (Scott) is also back, to chase the notorious monster; as he also learns more about his past.The film is about as cheesy as they get; poorly acted and filled with horrible dialogue. It is entertaining though, if you like this type of movie. I never saw the first film, and I don't really think I need to; after seeing this one. I'm sure if you've seen one 'Pitchfork' movie, you've probably seen them all.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/BpWXjqkP56w",neutral,movie
72705,"I came back to check if this movie was listed as a horror comedy but no, and I think that's a huge factor of why this movie is rated this low. The main problem is to watch this movie seriously instead of just enjoying it. From the get go this movie is cheesy as hell, has puns and every sign of trying to be funny more than creepy.
Not even with these facts this is a very good movie, but it's really enjoyable whatsoever. But I think this movie knows its limitations and tries to do it's best from there.
If you enjoy B movies with cheesy acting, you should try this one.",neutral,movie

But sometimes change isn't good.The show is said to be superficial, and i don't doubt it.

72914,"At first, I was expecting this movie to be like the first one - cool costumes, original zords, great special effects, etc. In that regard it was quite a bit of a let-down. It was really more of a 90-minute season premiere than an interesting stand-alone movie.Still, it had its moments: Tommy and Kat in the jungle (that snake scene looked so fake, and when _hasn't_ Kat hurt her leg?!), the two Rangers becoming evil. And it did have a little bit of big-screen drama. The effects weren't exactly morphenominal, but they were pretty much consistent with the show.The biggest disappointment was the sorry storyline and lack of explanation of where their new powers came from. Of course, there was purportedly an earlier storyline in which Billy returned from Aquitar in need of the Zeo crystal and a scene explaining their new powers, but they cut that part out after David Yost's unpleasant departure from the series.To sum up, probably wasn't worth it to pay six bucks to see it, but it's definitely a must for any hardcore Power Rangers fan (especially since you kind of needed to see it for the TV season to make sense).",neutral,movie

72985,"A couple enter the town of Gatlin and hit a child with their car. After trying to find a police officer or anyone to report it to, they stumble on the town's secret: no one over a certain age is alive, and children are commanded by a prophet for a pagan harvest god.All I want to say about this film is that it is a weak, pathetic interpretation of the original, and can be disregarded. The dialogue is cheesy, the SyFy Network production values are cheap ,as usual... and even the kids are less creepy than they originally were. The prophet child has no personality whatsoever.I didn't read the book, so maybe this is explained therein, but the people in this version are different from the original. They seem angrier, less easy to sympathize with. The man is a military veteran who apparently gets flashbacks, making the scenes in the corn ambiguous: are the visions from He Who Walks Behind the Rows or just stress? I suppose one should not expect too much from SyFy. But instead of investing in this film, they should just air the original. This version adds nothing to the original and is not an improvement. One cannot even say it's ""updated"" because it still takes place in 1975. Just avoid this one.",neutral,movie

Unable to convince some local kids to help them out they walk to Divinity Falls where the local sheriff advises them to get on the next bus out of town. Unfortunately for them, they don't take his advice. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an adequate horror film for the most part due which benefited from the inclusion of some decent actors like David Carradine (as ""Luke"") and Eva Mendez (""Kir""). It also featured a couple of twists here and there with Kir's decision to readily join the cult somewhat of a surprise.

73207,"Honestly i got into this movie in the first act. The character played by Denise Richard is enjoyable and nice and you can really get behind her. The story is unfolding in a nice pace and all. The problems comes in the third act where heavy bad CGI is involved along some bad camera works and lightning, which are probably to hide the lack of budget, and at that point the movie is not as much entertaining to me. You look at this and at part you think ""what is going on ?"" Despite this, i still think its a decent low budget Saturday night TV movie... There is nothing that is totally cringe worthy even if you must turn your brain off big time during the third act especially. And sure Air Force One is still by far a better movie, but its not horrible as some said in reviews.I was never ""bored"" per say and i wanted to see how it would end. Denise Richards may seem like an odd choice for this role as she is not really known for action roles, but i think she did the job fine, and even if she aged obviously since her Starship Troopers day, she still charmed me.This movie is AVERAGE by a low budget standard.

73226,"Where to begin? This is, just possibly, the most moronic zombie movie ever made. It isn't the worst  it's more entertaining than House of the Dead  but it certainly must be a serious candidate for the most inept.The story concerns a group of German soldiers who are killed by French partisans and thrown in a cursed lake. A few years later they rise up as zombies and proceed to attack the village.It's a similar premise to Oasis of the Zombies. And it shares that film's incompetence, except this film is even more badly made. Everything about it is shoddy in the extreme. The script is seriously stupid. Whose idea was it to have the paternal zombie? The scenes with the little girl are among the most idiotic I have ever witnessed and I've seen a lot of rubbish. The zombie make-up is, to say the least, half-hearted. Faces covered in green paint do not a great zombie make, especially when that said green paint rubs off onto their victims. The underwater scenes are quite clearly a swimming pool  you can see the bloody sides for goodness sake. And it's not the best when we witness a zombie swim up to catch some air. The acting/dubbing is of the most disastrous kind, everyone is spectacularly unconvincing and unsympathetic. And don't get me started on the supposed time-frame. Judging by the age of the little girl, this film is clearly meant to be set in the 50's but this does not explain the 80's fashions, haircuts and vehicles. They haven't even tried to cover these up. It's a travesty. Even the camera-work is diabolical.From the Jean Rollin movies I've seen, it seems clear that Zombie Lake incorporates all of the faults that can be seen in his other work but minus any of the good bits he sometimes manages to come up with. He's a director who has very little ability to conjure up suspense and horror. He is much more comfortable with sleaze and this movie is full of that at least. There is tons of full-frontal female nudity. But it's still not even very erotic.This isn't a complete waste of time because it's fun to watch as a cinematic car crash. You'll get a few laughs at this mess of a movie. There are too many mistakes to mention and the general level of shoddiness is spectacular. For zombie completists and bad film fanatics only.",neutral,movie
73293,"'Ice Spiders' offers you very little that you haven't seen before, if you've seen your fair share of modern creature features. It's got the standard-issue abundance of tacky digital effects, the goofy and over the top cartoonish deaths, a bunch of inane characters and performances, and yet another dose of that oh-so-familiar ""surfer dude"" speak that we've heard in countless movies since the early 1980s.Patrick Muldoon (""Starship Troopers"") stars as a washed-up skiing star working as an instructor at a resort. He must become one of the heroes when a half dozen extremely aggressive, oversized arachnids go on the attack. Not surprisingly, they are the result of typical genetic experiments. A scientist on the project, played by the sexy Vanessa Williams (not the singer / actress, but the other one, whose credits include ""Candyman"" and ""New Jack City""), tries to warn people, but it's already too late.I did say in another very recent review that these types of movies start to blend together after a while. If you've seen just one, chances are you'll know what to expect from most of them. This one has a silly script with some genuinely bad dialogue, but the actors still get some credit for reciting all of it with their best poker faces on display.And that sincerity does help. Personally speaking, this viewer would rather have filmmakers take themselves at least somewhat seriously. Excessive winking at the audience in this day and age has sort of run its course.Muldoon is an amiable heroic hunk, and Williams handles her exposition duties capably. Thomas Calabro ('Melrose Place') is okay as a tough-as-nails military officer. But most of the curiosity derives from the casting of TV veteran Stephen J. Cannell in a substantial acting role, and he's good as one of the few characters in this movie who's able to keep his cool and use his head.An okay one-time watch for cheese lovers, but very disposable overall.Directed by Tibor Takacs, the Hungarian-born filmmaker who also gave the world ""The Gate"" and ""I, Madman"".Five out of 10.",neutral,movie
73359,"Grizzly Park fails to fulfill its original purpose as horror film, so if you're looking for a scare, don't waste your time. That is not to say that it's not worth seeing. The only major redeeming quality this film has is it's variety of stereotype characters (and I'm not using stereotypical as a bad thing here) and their interactions, which was interesting to watch. These interactions are still undeveloped and had the movie not been distracted with trying to be horrific, it would have been a great drama about eight unflinchingly rotten youths with different backgrounds who get what's coming to them.There is no character development; everyone stays the same until the end, but the versatility of the characters makes up for that. I liked that there were no sudden bouts of ""courage"" which is a generic element found in a lot of other horror movies. The characters die unrepentant, which I think is a noble trait for a villain to have.Other than that, the props look fake, the directing is mediocre, the acting is decent, and the dialog is OK with some good witticism here and there. A major problem with the writing is as all the other reviews point out, the undeveloped subplot of the escaped murderer/rapist which makes you wonder why it was included in the writing in the first place.Bottom line, on a scale of one to ten for a horror movie I'd give this film a one, and for a morbid drama I'd give it a seven.",neutral,movie

It's up to Dr. Frank Abernathy, his daughter, father and two federal agents to find a way to stop it, before their time is up and the town would be no longer.A total kooky throwback to the b-grade sci-fi 50's alien invasion / monsters on the rampage with the screenplay keeping it tongue-in-cheek, even with somewhat a lousy script. Pretty much it has fun at its own expense with a vibrant ray of performances. Vincent Ventresca nicely laps it up as the nervous, work-minded Dr. Frank Abernathy and Summer Glau brings brashness to her part as his daughter. Tom Skerritt looks like his having a good time and Leila Arcieri brings a calm intensity to her role.Director Tim Cox does a moderate job blending the large dose of comical elements with sub-standard CGI effects (the gigantic mammoth) and cartoonish action. Suspense isn't generated, but the frenetic pace and chaos occurring remains amusingly fun and campy.An enjoyable throwaway.",neutral,movie
73452,"When I found ""The Chosen"" I had no knowledge about it at all. I didn't know who starred in it or what it was about. I just happened to find it in the horror section. And being a horror fan I needed very little persuasion in order to pick it up and give it a go.I must say that I found the story to be rather interesting. It was a good story concept and there were some rather twisted and disturbing elements to it, such as having to sacrifice your own family members in order for a single person to remain alive and having to pick out which ones to sacrifice. It should be said that the story was rather predictable, so don't expect any curve balls here.The acting in the movie was adequate, although I wasn't familiar with anyone on the cast list. Which, in itself, is a plus for me, because I like watching new acting talents in movies.For a horror movie that involved a hellish entity, then it was a movie that was rather scarce on special effects. Sure, there were special effects and CGI in the movie, just used in moderation. Which was a shame, because it felt like it held the movie back.The movie was in overall adequate, but at times it felt a bit forced and rigid at times. Whether that was because of the director or the writers I do not know. But it was an enjoyable enough movie for what it turned out to be.As for the ending of the movie, well it made very little sense to me, so I guess that whatever the writers were aiming at was lost on me.All in all, ""The Chosen"" scores 5 out of 10 stars from me.",neutral,movie

73505,"Sherlock Holmes is not a good movie by a long shot, but in comparison to some of the other movies Asylum has churned out it is not that bad either.I do agree it does have its problems. The film is low budget, and some of it does show, as some of the production values while not terrible are not great. Some of the editing could have been better, while the film is dully lit and some of the sets, locations and costumes are just okay if somewhat uninteresting. The dinosaur and dragon are quite good though. The film is too short, and I think too rushed as well, and while it was nice to listen to the soundtrack was forgettable soon after. Ben Syder does do what he can with the iconic detective known as Sherlock Holmes but I couldn't help thinking in terms of mannerisms and appearance he was miscast.However, the direction was decent, as was the script which had some nice touches without being entirely exceptional. While it does have its holes and quite strange in its feel, the story is an interesting one and entertaining enough if you don't think about it too much, the villain is enjoyable and there are some good performances from Gareth David as a more quiet and composed Watson and Dominic Keating. Elizabeth Arends is lovely, and the climax was diverting and much better than I expected.Overall, there is nothing outstanding on display, and those who are looking for a faithful adaptation will be disappointed. But it is mildly entertaining with some good things if you don't take it too seriously. 5/10 Bethany Cox",neutral,movie

Now, the plots are not very similar. But a group of young women getting into witchcraft in the mid-1990s during the Wiccan craze? Suspicious.

73771,"I didn't plan on writing a review about this movie, cause there simply isn't that much to say about it and I didn't have a strong liking or disliking for it, it was just a okay but flawed watchI'd like to point out that even though Steven Segal and Vinnie Jones despite getting top-billing and on the poster are not in it for that many scenes (3 to be exact).Now I don't even like them so personally I don't care but I know they have a strong following so I thought I'd give the heads up to their fans who might be eager to watch them.It's also not a action-movie as the poster is made to look like, it's more of a slow burning film noir type movie, not a very successful one but that is the genre I think they are heading for.It's not all negative though George Eads from CSI is a pretty cool guy in the lead and I wouldn't mind seeing him lead other movies in the future.The plot is decent when it's not all over the place, I could have done without 1 or 2 twists though, which felt terribly forced, like they often do in movies like these.AnnaLynne McCord whom I loved in Excision and enjoyed in Scorned (despite that movie being very flawed her performance was very entertaining) is just okay here, feels like she's not really trying too hard.Tia Carrere appears in one pretty pointless scene.What more can I say?

Once you get used to that, there are some interesting bits, including a great robot, a nifty flying car and an ending that retains some of the poetry of the original space epic.

73837,"""Gunslinger"" was an early ""B"" western drama from Producer/Director Roger Corman. Shot in color on a shoestring budget, it is nevertheless an interesting little western.When Rose Hood's (Beverly Garland) husband the Marshal is murdered, she is forced to strap on a gunbelt and take over his job. The local saloon madam Erica Page (Alison Hayes) feels threatened, she sends her lovesick bartender Jake (Jonathon Haze) to hire a gunslinger to kill the marshal. All in black gunfighter Cane Miro (John Ireland) rides into town to take on the job. It seems that Cane also has an axe to grind with the town's mayor (Martin Kingsley). Of course Cane becomes attracted to Rose and she to him. Cane is torn between the two women. But he ultimately succumbs to his dark side and the finale involves the final shootout between Rose and Cane.Corman adds a few little twists that make this film a cut above your average ""B"" western. First there is a female villain in Erica and a knock down drag out fight between herself and Rose. Next there is a sequence where the three saloon girls try to lynch Rose. There is also an excellent scrap involving Ireland and Chris Alcaide playing the deputy Joshua.The acting is above average for a Corman picture of this period. Garland, always one of my personal western gals, is good in the lead. Ireland, always under rated, is excellent as the title character. Alison Hayes makes a chilling villain and Corman regular Haze is quite good as the simple minded Jake.This film is certainly worth a look.",neutral,movie
73882,"Don Dohler's Nightbeast comes from Amazing Film Productions, which might be pushing it a bit (okay... a lot). A classic example of low-budget regional B-movie sci-fi/horror schlock, the film opens with an ugly alien with lots of teeth crash-landing in small-town U.S.A. where it proceeds to kill and mutilate anyone it meets. Why? 'Cos it's hangry!The hero of the piece is Sheriff Cinder (Tom Griffith), who sports a greying afro perm, a droopy moustache, and large sunglasses; he's joined by several other locals in trying to destroy the monster, including deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian), whose hair is almost as bad as the Sheriff's. As well as shockingly nasty hair, Nightbeast also features terrible performances all-round from the presumably amateur cast, some gratuitous female nudity, an out-of-nowhere sex scene between Cinder and Kent (two unattractive people bumping uglies is the real horror!), and a healthy dose of gore, including disembowelment, a severed arm, a clawed face, decapitation, and a guy fried to a crisp by high-voltage.These gore effects are cheap but satisfyingly messy; the visual effects, on the other hand, are just cheap, from the terrible alien craft in space to the really naff sparkly laser-gun blasts, this is laughable stuff indeed. Dohler's direction is basic and the film does tend to drag between the splattery death scenes, but if you're into cheesy '80s drive-in trash, I guess you could do worse.",neutral,movie

They have made some decent zombie movies too, but this was unexpected, not the usual Asylum movie, it worked and seems to be one of their higher rated movies so far.The Asylum tend to mostly make their own straight to DVD version of the latest potential blockbusters usually with a budget of less than $1,000,000 and normally get their money back within a few months with channels like the Sy-Fy channel buying their stuff and of course the DVD sales.The movie was reasonably funny, none of their usual cheesy effects, cute characters...thought the guys are dorks, with some references to other zombie movies like the flash back called 28 days earlier and a cat called Romero. ;) The lead actress is good and cute, there is some mild gore, the zombies are not your usual zombies, they are a bit lame at times and there is plenty of young female skin...if you like that sort of thing ;) (Movie starts with 2 full frontal girls and plenty of boobs to follow and more).Anyway the story is a sorority girl who seems a bit of a nerd, starts dating a zombie....jeez she could do much better, she's hot. ;) but thankfully a zombie apocalypse breaks out and its up to our nerdy girl to save the day when she discovers a cure.Another movie added to my ever growing list of Zombie movies... 646 titles and counting lol.BTW nothing wrong with running zombies, if they are recently infected and not too damage then why can't they run? :p",neutral,movie

I was already fantasizing about my IMDb review, saying how I was expecting crap and found a gem.Of course, that only lasted for the first half of the movie. Afterwards, attempts to make the movie follow a script, budget concerns and other movie politics made it all fall into the gutter of action movies when the cardboard villain must come into focus and be honorably defeated by the hero. I call bullshit. If the movie would have continued in the same style as the first half of the movie, where heroes meet on the battlefield of the arena and wither win or lose, it would have been a decent, even good film. Instead, hair gel and bad villain lines polluted the ending and turned it into another crappy video game movie. Why?!?!?Summary: Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa should have asked for a fortune in payment for the silly hair style of his character, probably something taken from the video game Tekken, that I have never played. The main character looked like a combination of Jean Claud van Damme and the vampire from Twilight. The hot chick that is the focus of his male desire gives him a kiss after being totally easy, but she denies him any... ahem... action. He returns to his slum where a girlfriend that actually wants and accepts sex awaits him. That part was artfully realistic. Tamlyn Tomita is still hot as hell, even if she keeps playing roles of moms that have to die. Kelly Overton mimics some decent fight moves, even if her only purpose in the movie is to look good.After thoughts: I wonder what would have happened if the hot girl would have actually had to participate in the tournament and fight Jin, and then the father grandfather angle actually been used in a royal politics manner... a good script maybe? Why did Raven (a black guy with white clothes and white hair?! An albino raven, maybe? What hair gel company sponsor this movie?Bottom line: watch 45 minutes of the movie. Stop.

Original stuff huh!This is the second of four that I've watched, the first being from the same year and starring Skeet Ulrich/Sean Young. That one was a tad better than this effort.For those of you unfamiliar with an Escape Room it's a tourist attraction where a group of people are locked in a room (Or series of) and have to look at their surroundings solving puzzles in order to escape within an assigned time.Here we see a group of friends participate in one for someones birthday and the experience gradually goes from fun to lethal. Whereas the Ulrich movie was supernatural this goes in more of a Saw (2004) direction.Though the concept is sound the execution is rather lacking. Sure it looks the part but the delivery and the threat is poorly paced and the characters are simply not likeable. They range from obnoxious to blatantly bad folk that you can't exactly cheer on.To make matters worse the movie fizzles out at the end. I believe a finale can make a terrible film suddenly great or a great film suddenly terrible.

74688,"Cabin Fever 3? Where did it come from? Why is it here? Who made it? All these questions you'll probably never really figure out by watching the film. The first in the series was released over a decade ago. It was a nice (or rather horrible!) little film about a flesh-eating virus which didn't need any more done on the subject matter. However, they made a second instalment anyway. This was met with pretty much universal hatred. Therefore, the fact they went as far as to make number three remains a mystery.Personally, I didn't mind the second one. Yes, it wasn't as good as the first, but it was just about watchable. Number three is about five times worse than number two. It's about four American youngsters (who's good looks just about make up for any social niceties) who go to a remote island for some reason (are you bothered? You're only interested in the gore!) and end up falling foul to that good ol' fashioned killer virus we all know so well.Cabin Fever 3 is low budget. I have nothing against low budget films. However, if you can't afford A-list actors or special effects, at least try to make up for it by entertaining characters we can root for and relate to. No such luck here. When it comes to the battle between flesh-eating virus verses man, you too will probably root for the virus.The only famous face you might recognise is Sean Astin. Mordor and fun with Frodo seems a long way off now and he's reduced to some sort of extended sub-plot/cameo in this film. At least he's tried to disguise his appearance with a beard, but you can tell beneath the facial hair he's ashamed to be here and would rather have flung himself into Mount Doom instead of the One Ring. While the annoyingly good-looking teens are being eaten alive by the bug, Sean's been captured by a scientist who is so evil he speaks with a kind of randomly-changing accent which can be anything from British, through Canadian to American. Plus he seems to have employed two Victoria Secrets models for his lab assistants.However, it's not all bad (well, mostly it is). There is some nice gore and make-up. However, that makes up about ten of the ninety minutes. For the rest you'll probably be asking yourself why these infected people suddenly start behaving like zombies half way through the film (when you're not dwelling on why this film was ever made in the first place). If you like dark and gory horror (with a helping of tongue in cheek) then watch the first Cabin Fever – ignore anything that shares its name made after the original.",neutral,movie

74858,"...because based on the evidence of ""The Tripper"" he's an average-at-best director and a distinctly second- or even third-string screenwriter, though no doubt hamstrung by the scripting contributions of Joe ""Darkness Falls"" Harris. I'm sorry, I admire good intentions as well as the next guy, but only when they rise above mundane infernal construction projects, if you catch my drift. ""The Tripper"" is essentially a vanity project, and suffers accordingly.The production values are alright for a relatively low-budget affair, especially the at-times lovely DP work from Bobby ""Arlington Road"" Bukowski, and the acting varies from earnestly professional (particularly leads Lukas ""Mars Attacks"" Haas and Jaime ""Sin City"" King) to egregiously self-conscious (most notably the ever-moronic-but-somehow-likable Jason ""I owe Kevin Smith everything"" Mewes and Paul ""I AM Pee-Wee!"" Reubens), with various shades in-between, including a slumming Thomas ""The Mist"" Jane as a local sheriff doing his best to keep a straight face. No one, though, collectively or individually, is able to redeem the sophomoric script.I won't bore my gentle reader with yet another synopsis; you can find that in profusion elsewhere. ""The Tripper"" is, at best, a slasher film pseudo-parody that plays things too seriously to be genuinely funny, and too tongue-in-cheek to be remotely scary. Arquette should have gone for one or the other, not both. It's a watch-once film that I'm quite relieved I found at the library instead of wasting money buying or renting it.",neutral,movie

74926,"They always say that the best stories are the most simple. 'Alien' was famously pitched (and then green-lit) as simply 'Jaws in Space.' So, bearing that in mind, '247F' should be an absolute classic. Hopefully it's not too much of a 'spoiler' to say that it's not.However, it is certainly simple. Four teenagers go to a cabin in the woods and, for once, don't get attacked by any form of supernatural entity. Sadly, that doesn't mean their trip isn't without tragic incident. For, instead of being chased by various chainsaw-wielding nut-jobs, they get locked in a sauna. Now, some may say that that's probably a lot less traumatic than being stalked by inter-dimensional demons wearing ice hockey masks. Apparently, though, it's just as deadly.If you can get past the fact that the only wooden door (entrance/exit) to the sauna is seemingly protected by a class 9 forcefield, making it completely impervious to any form of physical attack, then you'll go on a journey with the teens as they try to figure out a way of escaping their ever-heating 'prison.'The cast is... er, there. Apparently, some of them have done other TV work, but I'm afraid I haven't seen any of them before. They do their best with what they have to work with. They're teens in effectively a 'slasher' flick without a slasher. You know that some are 'expendable' and I guess you can have some fun trying to work out who's not going to make it out of there. One girl has a backstory, summed up in a three minute montage sort of scene at the beginning of the film.Anyway, this film is cheap and not that memorable.

Growing up in the south I definitely related to the Skynyrd references etc. I related to the sets where the scenes where shot etc. etc.There was some humor here, but in spurts. I felt a little cheated watching the same rehashed dialogue from the first movie. I think the spirit of the movie is there, just not all the way through it.

75087,"To many people in France, the name ""Belphégor"" represents one of the best and most famous novels in the horror fiction genre. Written by Arthur Bernède, ""Belphégor"" was an intriguing story, mix of horror, suspense and mystery, where a detective attempted to unveil the mystery behind a ghostly presence that haunted the Louvre Museum. Bernède was a man fascinated by cinema, so many of his novels were devised to be adapted to screen as soon as possible. Naturally, ""Belphégor"" became a silent film in 1927, however, the story reached cult status in 1965 when Bernède's novel became the basis for one of the most popular French TV series of the 60s. To many people in France, ""Belphégor"" is truly a revered tale of horror and mystery, but sadly, this new incarnation of Bernède's novel ends up as an average entry in French cinema.""Belphégor - Le Fantôme Du Louvre"", begins as an old collection of Egyptian artifacts is found in the vaults of the Museum during the works of restoration. Strangely, the artifacts are not cataloged, so they start to be checked by the Museum's team of Egyptologists. As the main Mummy of the discovery is checked, its spirit awakes, and escapes through the museum's electrical system, becoming a haunting presence in the Museum. At the same time, Lisa (Sophie Marceau), a woman who lives across the street, enters accidentally inside the Museum as the restoration work makes a hole in her basement. Soon she finds herself possessed by the free spirit of Belphégor, who now will use her body for his own evil purposes.The movie was written by a very talented team of writers (Danièle Thompson, Jérôme Tonnerre and director Jean-Paul Salomé himself), however, the final result is really disappointing considering the talents of those involved in it. ""Belphégor - Le Fantôme Du Louvre"" moves seriously away from Bernède's novel with the inclusion of a heavier focus in the supernatural elements, and a considerable lack in the mystery and suspense of the story (basically the elements that made the TV series popular). It's not difficult to understand why the French fans got angry as the film has little to no resemblance to the story's earlier incarnations, and seems to had used Bernède's novel only as a blueprint for a typical blockbuster action film.Director Jean-Paul Salomé confirms this intention by making this movie an action-adventure film with an obvious Hollywood style. Salomé makes the bold decision of attempting what director Stephen Sommers did with ""The Mummy"" (transforming a classic horror film into an action film), but sadly he fails, leaving ""Belphégor"" unfocused and almost without a trace of its original incarnation. Despite this huge problem, Salomé shows an effective and technically good direction, and at times his use of the camera and the work with his actors really make the film work. His follow-up to ""Belphégor"", a new version of the adventures of Maurice Leblanc's character ""Arsène Lupin"", is a better demonstration of Salomé's talents as an action film director.The film's saving grace is definitely the talented cast of the movie, as the group of actors really try to do their best job despite the script's many problems, making the film at least enjoyable. The beautiful Sophie Marceau leads the cast as Lisa, still delivering a good performance as always. Fréderic Diefenthal is her love interest, Martin, a young man decided to save Lisa from Belphégor's possession. Diefenthal is effective, and makes a good counterpart to Marceau, but the real treasures are Julie Christie and Michel Serrault, who in their supporting roles steal every scene they are in, and prove their great talent for the subtle comedy their two characters domain. It's a joy to see the two experienced actors giving their best despite the film's obvious problems.As written above, the script is the movie's biggest problem, not because it deviates from the source novel (that's hardly a sin), but because the approach the story takes seem unfocused and without direction, almost as if the writers weren't sure if to make the movie a mystery film or an action-adventure one. Clearly the purpose was to modernize an old favorite by making it attractive to the younger crowd, but it seems that in the process the writers lost the essence of Bernède's novel delivering a void soulless product. Hoever, this is not to say that the film is awful, the problem is that it just doesn't attempt to be something better, ending with just an average adventure film missing the enormous potential of the story.While this is not exactly an example of the best Modern French dark fantasy films (Pitof's ""Vidocq"" or Salomé's own ""Arsène Lupin"" are better), it's by no means a bad movie. However, I would only recommend it to die hard fans of the genre, or to fans of the actors involved, as this is simply, another mediocre and typical entry in the action-adventure genre. 5/10",neutral,movie

But when Conrad enrolls Jake into an internet program called ""the Pathway"" things begin to get truly bizarre. Suddenly both he and his two friends begin to get telephone calls advising them about their circumstances and telling them what to do. At any rate, rather than divulge any future surprises that may be in store for the person who hasn't seen this film, I will refrain from telling any more of the story. But I will say that this movie has some clever twists in it. Especially at the end. Now, I don't know how much money was spent to produce this movie but it has the feel of a low-budget production. The special effects, especially on the part of Satan, weren't that good and the character development on the part of Dakota could have been better as well. Be that as it may, the director (David Winkler) did a pretty good job with what he had as this is a fairly decent horror-mystery picture. Jensen Ackles performed rather well as did Dominique Swain, Teach Grant and Shannyn Sossamon (as Jakes' girlfriend ""Marisol"").

This one turned out to be probably their lowest movie ever. For starters, no drug humor. It features them as siblings in pre-revolutionary France (despite the fact that they talk like 20th century Americans) making a mess of the status quo. Much of the little humor that the movie provides derives from the fact that if one of them gets injured, the other feels it.So, this is definitely not the Cheech & Chong movie that I recommend.

The rest of the movie is comprised of her having to face her dark past if she wants to save her boyfriend from an uncertain fate. I say uncertain because the immediate danger to him is never made clear. The whole movie lacks the sense of desperation and urgency that horror movies depend on. It really felt like everyone involved was merely going through the motions in front of the camera. I never got attached to any of the characters. There is a twist at the end that should invoke an emotional response from the viewer but I felt nothing. The direction and camera work is lackluster, as is the make-up and special effects. The entire thing has a made for TV feeling attached to it, which isn't surprising given the cast. There are plenty of moments where the viewer is supposed to jump out of their seat but they are executed so poorly that I found myself looking at the flaws in the make-up and totally detached from the story. Believe me though, this isn't the worst movie ever made. I'd call it a good idea in a mediocre movie. You won't hate yourself for watching it, but there's plenty of better movies to watch first.

75513,"Now it is time again; for the third time racing drivers drive furiously and recklessly on the streets - racing for things like power, prestige, money and women. While Tokyo Drift may sound like 'just another movie about cars', it is much different from the previous two Fast and Furious installments, shifting from the hot streets of Californa to Tokyo, Japan. The protagonist is no longer surfer-boy Paul Walker, but Lucas Black as 17-year-old Sean who always escapes his problems by moving away.But Sean decides to stay in Tokyo this time to deal after gets entangled in a dirty Yakuza mess when he races against a Yakuza boss's nephew, and steals his girlfriend (unforgivably annoying Nathalie Kelley). The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) thus sees American Sean and his crude ways juxtaposed with the sleek technology of Tokyo. It is an effective contrast, and the Tokyo background provides visual stimuli throughout the film, elevating it above generic formula.But ultimately, this is ALL that is good about this film because the acting is atrocious - not any of the leads should ever be allowed to act again, even with better writing. The exception and stand-out performance in Tokyo Drift is the sexy Sung Kang as the guy who takes Sean in when he comes to Tokyo, and teaches him in the ways of 'drifting'.

75914,"""Spawn"" is a special effects spectacle unlike anything before it. It has some dazzling CGI effects to complement its dark tone and breathe life into the Gothic fantasy, and wondrous cinematography to carry it out. Unfortunately, that's all it has to offer, which is a real shame, because this had the potential to be one hell (pun intended) of a movie.As a reader of ""Spawn"" comics and collector of ""Spawn"" merchandise (and affiliated McFarlane Toys products), I saw at an early age how ""Spawn"" revolutionized the comics industry with its mystical premise, graphic visuals, Heaven vs. Hell battle theme and gratuitous sex and violence, and while such gusto has been embraced by fans, this 1997 film adaptation of Todd McFarlane's popular underground comic, directed by Mark A.Z. Dippe', is rated ""PG-13"" (subsequent home video versions were of the ""R""-rated director's cut, which contained additional footage), the watered-down violence more cartoonish than graphic. In short, in the comic book world, Spawn is not like anything else out there.The story is that the demon Malebolgia needs fresh souls for his ever-growing army of undead soldiers to lead an eventual conquest of Earth, and then, Heaven, in what will eventually bring about Armageddon. All Malebolgia needs is a general for his army, and, Holy Lazarus, recently deceased CIA operative Al Simmons (newcomer Michael Jai White) has just the extra-crispy corpse for the job.See, Simmons was set up by his insane former employer Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) after making a bargain with Malebolgia's go-to guy and Earthbound lieutenant, the pudgy, disgusting Clown (John Leguizamo, completely unrecognizable in his get-up), to kill Simmons so that he would be sent to Hell. While in Hell (which looks like a CGI version of a Marilyn Manson concert on steroids), Simmons makes a deal with Malebolgia to lead his army, in exchange for one last chance to see his wife Wanda Blake (Theresa Randle), who is now married to his best friend Terry Fitzgerald (D.B. Sweeney) and together the two now have a young daughter named Cyan (Sydni Beaudoin).Back on Earth and unaware that five years have passed, Simmons has a burnt-to-a-crisp visage that doesn't sit well with people not accustomed to undead soldiers from Hell. He establishes sympathetic links with the homeless denizens of alley Rat City, chiefly young Zack (Miko Hughes), and is watched over by the Godsend Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson). When Simmons's body comes out of its larval stage and transforms him into a ""Hellspawn,"" a being with an endoplasmic and invincible suit of armor, he sees his chance to use these new powers to exact vengeance on Wynn, his lethal vixen Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke), reunite with Wanda, and seek a way to break out of his agreement with Hell.As stated earlier, ""Spawn"" is one hell of a special effects spectacle, and it looks great, but a lot goes wrong in too many places. I was dazzled to see one of my favorite superheroes on the screen nearly 10 years ago as an impressionable pre-teen. Now at 21, I am sorely disappointed by what I see today. ""Spawn"" still could have been good, even without with the full-on graphic content and Heaven & Hell mysticism of the source material. While a largely accurate reflection of the comics, it still gives more credence to my assertion that this is ""Spawn""-lite. Presumably, studio bosses weren't keen on marketing a Hellbound superhero to the masses, so measures were probably taken to make the vehicle more accessible. (Take my advice and stick to the animated HBO miniseries.)On the plus side, Michael Jai White makes an efficient hero and this remains the actor's most well-known part. We do feel his pain (even if it seems forced at times), his quips, and overall faithful portrayal of the character. Sheen makes for a coolly sadistic madman but it's Leguizamo who steals the show. His gross-out-humor, maggot-munching portrayal of the Clown is just what takes this movie out of the dregs and into full-blown camp territory. Lastly, the soundtrack, a mix of heavy metal and techno, does have some pretty wicked sounds.It's easy to see that only core fans will want to stick with this picture. It had such a great chance to be something unlike anything else out there. With the comic book craze still in full swing in Hollywood, ""Spawn"" seems forgotten, or at the very least, sitting on the sidelines. But ""Spawn,"" to me, seems to be an example of mis-marketing, a brilliant idea gone haywire. Maybe it should have stayed in Hell, where it belongs.5/10",neutral,movie

She twitches and bites her lips and represses her smiles and it's dizzying and annoying and anti-comedy. Look at Shirley MacLaine for goodness sake! Has Jennifer Aniston seen ""The Apartment""?

76241,"The trailers were a bit deceiving. It looked like an action packed film, but it was a heavy political drama instead. Needless to say, I thought this movie was a mixed-bag. It has moments where it reels you in with some brilliant tension, but then loses your interest altogether by being overly talky and depressing. This movie is a pretty joyless movie that doesn't offer much in the way of entertainment. I'm extremely picky on political movies because they have a tendency to be really boring. This movie falls under that category. There is some action. I'll give Sean Penn credit for holding his own in that department. He looks buff and seems to be in pretty good shape, but he wasn't that convincing in the role of a tough guy. He does fine during the fights, but he felt out-of-place. I've definitely seen him do better. Javier Bardem is fun, but goes a bit OTT. He doesn't know when enough is enough. Idris Elba isn't in the movie as much as you may think. His part isn't much. Jasmine Trica isn't that great as the love interest. She's bland and didn't offer anything special. I didn't buy her romance with Penn. Winstone has presence and does fine his role. Mark Rylance makes a boring villainThis movie is overlong, plodding, boring, and way too heavy-handed to fully succeed. It has its moments, but not nearly enough of them. Wait for cable, VOD, or Blu-Ray/DVD! Don't waste your money on it at a theater. 5.5/10",neutral,movie
76302,"The Paperboy was an interesting film to watch in that I wasn't always sure where the film was headed, and I wasn't always so sure if the film even cared about where it was headed as well. The film is really more of a character story then it is a southern noir narrative-a coming of age story somehow mixed up with a southern Gothic noir-but the plot is pretty irristiable if you're a fan of films like ""Night of The Hunter"" or much more on the mark comparison wise ""The Gingerbread Man"" (a much better film i think this might make an interesting companion piece to sometime down the line) The plot (for those of you who don't already know) essentially is Matthew McConaughey is a reporter who returns home to write a story about a convicted sheriff killer John Cusack--there seems to be a story involving the question of his actual guilt. Meanwhile McConaughey's hires his college drop out brother Zac Efron to do some driving around while he does his investigations. Cusack's convict has been having a steamy pen-pal relationship with a rather hot to trot Nicole Kidman. When Zach Efron first sets his eyes on her--he falls head over heels in love with her--and things develop somewhat senselessly from there.I just want to state that everyone here is severely miscast with the exception of Macy Gray as the maid to the family the two brothers are from-if you have a film with these actors in it and the most effective performance comes from someone who's not known for being an actor--that's a major sign that something's not working right here. McConaughy and Kidman try their best to sell their characters' but both get tripped up by the script here. Its nice that Cusack and Kidman were given the chance to play someone so 180 degrees from their normal screen persona yet neither really seems to impress in their role (Kidman makes the most of her character's trashiness--and there are some turns in the later half that Kidman does her best to sell but the film almost completely lets her down in terms of character development....Cusack however is terrible here--he's supposed to be someone so hard headed and mean but when you first see him on screen you don't see the man the characters are seeing...you see Cusack--i suppose director Lee Daniels was hoping to use Cusack's past screen performances here in order to sucker punch the audience with how much of a brute his character is--but this really only works against the film in that I kept asking myself ""Is he supposed to be like some of Cusack's prior characters or is this just something that wasn't intended?"") It actually would have made more sense if Cusack and McConaughey had switched roles and Cusack was the embittered reporter and McConaughey had been the southern brute because then at least the casting would have made some sort of sense. Efron is all right enough but i don't feel he especially offers any insight into what the character might be thinking or feeling--it all seems to be what's on the page in the script, and he's just playing that....but at least he doesn't take you out of the movie--in fact one of the best things I can honestly say about this movie is that nothing really takes you out of the movie--the narrative does a good job of pushing through whatever plot obstacles the writing and performances seem to throw in its way and its that kind of pacing that helps keep the movie nicely watchable even when what your watching doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.The movie is again fairly well paced--and you won't be bored watching what happens--you may have some questions and be rather disappointed where it all ends up--having not read the book i can't say whether or not the ending was effective there, but the ending of this film felt so tacked on and so arbitrary, it was almost as if the screenwriter was just throwing up his hands and saying i guess i have to end this somehow. I suspect the book was a lot better in terms of character motivation and plot specifics but there were definitely some questionable character behavior--things that seem completely out of the blue based on what we had already seen from these characters on screen already but whatever i guess. The movie is also plot and character and acting aside nicely visualized--Lee Daniels really does a fine job putting a visual stamp on Efron's obsessive lust for Kidman's character and the atmosphere of the southern swamps where Cusack's character lived as an alligator skinner (resulting in a really gross scene where you see an alligator being skinned and its innards fall completely out in complete close-up--its actually kind of awesome) Daniels' seems to be trying to go for a real 70's like atmosphere here style wise--and I would say he pulls it off quite nicely--some of the jittery jump cuts of Kidman or the gauzily lit ways Efron day dreams of Kidman are presented--and the soundtrack is nicely handled too.So when all is said and done you have a halfway watchable movie here, but one that is almost so completely bogged down by plot questions, sketchy characterizations, and some pretty bad casting decisions, that it almost feels like it was trying so hard to impress and be a wonderfully sleazy classic for the ages that they let some of the more important and basic things a movie needs to nail down slide by without checking to see if these movie basics actually work. Of course none of this will really matter when you stumble across it on cable TV at 3 in the morning where it will keep your attention and hook you in that you'll want to keep watching even though you know you should probably turn it off way that sometimes movies at that time do.",neutral,movie
76311,"While it is not my favourite genre, there is an appreciation for the horror genre. Mainly watched 'Child's Play 3' having decided to recently watch and review all the films in the 'Child's Play'/Chucky series, having been intrigued for a long time by Chucky's horror icon status, a deserved distinction.Do feel that the character himself is better than the films. The 'Child's Play'/Chucky films are very variable, with the first film being by far the best. None of the sequels are as good, though don't consider them unwatchable. 'Child's Play 3' has been deemed one of the, sometimes the, worst in the series. For me it is definitely the worst of the initial trilogy and although the title for worst is debatable it is a lesser one to me.There are faults in 'Child's Play 3'. The story is predictable with no originality and too much of it is complete nonsense. Aside from with Chucky, the dialogue is really cheesy and with two exceptions the acting is lacking, Justin Whalin being especially annoying. The romance was a pointless distraction, there seemingly to pad out time, and a few of the characters behave idiotically.Like the second film there is a rushed feel here, there is a sense of a relatively tight budget (although the film looks good still) and even tighter time constraints. Also felt that whereas the first 'Child's Play' avoided going the cheesy, goofy and formulaic route that it could easily have done considering the premise, 'Child's Play 3' did feel formulaic and too much of it failed to escape the unintentionally.However, 'Child's Play 3' looks slick and suitably ominous and the special effects don't disappoint, they blend very well, look eerily life-like and move easily. The music is more ambitious and even more haunting here, it fits very well. While lacking the panache of Tom Holland's in the first 'Child's Play', John Lafia's direction is more than competent. Chucky's lines are like in the first two films, darkly witty and clever with one-liners that are smart, frighteningly sarcastic and entertainingly twisted. In terms of individual scenes, the climax comes off best, being a lot of fun'Child's Play 3' does have entertainment value and some creepiness, with the attack scenes/kills and set pieces being creative and genuinely unsettling. Chucky is a character impossible to forget, the writers and effects team had the time of their lives clearly (as well as Brad Dourif of course). Wasn't crazy about the acting here, but will say that Andrew Robinson has an unsettling ball as his character. The biggest acting plus though, like the previous two films, is Dourif, the personification of malevolence and is also wickedly funny.In conclusion, watchable but not great by any stretch. 5/10 Bethany Cox",neutral,movie
76339,"Halloween 5, yeah, this was a disappointment, most fans don't really dig this sequel which is understandable. It is kind of stupid or just plain stupid; this is the story that most horror movie sequels try to rip off, the telepathic powers that get really annoying. It seems like every horror movie sequel has to have it, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street had it, why not include the Halloween franchise as well? Unfortunately I didn't get into it, I think because it was extremely unoriginal and not to mention that the story didn't really continue from the 4th sequel. The ending of Halloween 4 had Jamie turning evil, I guess they just totally dropped that idea which could have been great to see, instead we got a silly and typical horror story that was badly acted, edited, and directed.Michael Myers makes his way into a small shack by the river owned by a local hermit. Once there, Michael collapses and remains in a comatose state for a full year. On October 30th Michael awakens, kills the hermit, and returns to terrorize Haddonfield, where his young niece, Jamie Lloyd continues to live after nearly being killed by Michael the year before. Jamie has been mute since attacking her foster mother at the end of film 4, but exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her evil uncle. Dr. Sam Loomis realizes that this link exists, and plans to use it to put an end to Michael's reign of terror. Michael begins stalking Rachel and her friend Tina. After both are killed Jamie agrees to put herself in danger to help Loomis stop Michael for good. With Jamie's help, Loomis lures Michael back to the old Myers house. Michael makes many attempts at killing Jamie, finally getting the chance to in the attic. Jamie tries appealing to Michael's humanity by calling him ""Uncle"". Myers pauses, prompting Jamie to ask to see his face. He takes off his mask, and a lone tear runs down his face. Jamie reaches up to wipe it away, and Michael is thrown into a rage. The killer pursues Jamie, who runs into Loomis. The doctor seems to turn on the girl as he shouts for Michael to come and take her. It turns out that he has used the girl as bait, thus leading Michael to walk beneath a heavy chain net. But you have to see what happens next by watching the movie.While granted that this movie isn't the worst movie in the world, I do enjoy the Halloween sequels, I think this was a fall in the story line for the Halloween series. It really could have had a lot of potential, but since they dropped a few ideas that were presented in the previous Halloween sequel. Not to mention this is one of the rare times that I wasn't scared by Michael, he's loosing his touch no, I can't say that, please I can't say that it's the writing! It's the blasted writing! So if you wanna see the sequels, yeah, do watch it just to see the story continue, but if you are just looking for a scary movie in general, you can skip Halloween 5.5/10",neutral,movie
76367,"The ""talented young smart-ass goes to college and learns there's more to life than being skillful or clever"" theme is an old one and it's been done better many times in the past. Robert Young learned about teamwork in ""Navy Blue and Gold."" More recently Rob Lowe learned the lesson in ""Oxford Blues."" The difference between Drumline and these and other older films on the same theme is that the lead characters evoked more sympathy. Nick Cannon's Devon Miles character is a self-centered, posturing, swaggering jackass who evokes immediate dislike and though you see him grow up a little in the course of the film, you never really learn to like or respect him.Drumline also suffers from an identity crisis of its own. You're never really sure what sort of story it wants to tell. Is is a ""coming of age"" story, a drama, a comedy, a romance? It tries to be all of these at once and never seals the deal on any of them.Drumline could have told a good story about a New York kid learning that there's more than one way to be black in this world. There are a couple of hints of that in Devon's relationship with Laila. Her comment to Devon: ""Southern sisters don't date...we have boyfriends,"" could have been an opening to a good subplot about differences in black culture between different parts of the US, but, as with so many other possible plots, the story touches it lightly, and then flits off to something else. An arrogant young freshman such as Devon would have had many lessons to learn while finding his way in this environment, but the film misses nearly every opportunity to show us the relationships between the characters in any depth, so the performances come off as predictable and mechanical.All the same, I've seen Drumline several times and enjoyed it for what it does very well. The presentation of the music and and the work that goes into running a big university marching band are very good. I could have done with more of both. The all-too-brief glimpses of life at a black southern university are well done. Again, I could have done with more of that as well. Drumline also had moments of humor, and some visually engaging camera work, especially in the music scenes.I like this movie. I just wish it had been better done.",neutral,movie
76377,"Based on the book by Luc Besson and rumored to be his final directing project this is the story of Arthur who is spurred on by the tales of his missing grandfather to find the land of the Minimoys where a great treasure is hidden. The treasure is needed because a developer wants the land for apartment buildings. Arthur is shrunk and begins a journey to Necropolis where he hopes to find his grandfather and the treasure.Set seemingly in ""America"" with lines of dialog that are filled with British English this is a mixed bag of a movie. Most of the live action stuff isn't very good. Its poorly written and not very interesting on the whole, though the stories of the grandfathers inventions and adventures are pretty neat.(I'm sure kids will have a better time with the film since they won't have seen it before). The animated sequences, which make up the bulk of the film, do have some wonderful bits. Some of the dialog is knowingly funny in the right sort of way (I loved the forlorn Arthur bemoaning that the princess was too old for him, he being 10 and she being 1000). Bits such as Snoop Dog at a club are often scatter-shot funny,though I wonder if the Snoop sequence will date badly. The animation is often quite good with some bits being better looking than others(though I suspect that what looks to be the marrying of animated bits to live action plates is what got the film yanked from Oscar contention-not that it ever really had a chance.). I liked the character designs which are very Brian Froudish. I also liked the voice cast which included Robert DeNiro as the old king and David Bowie as a delicious villain.Yea I know how is it? Its okay, As I said better in pieces. There is a really good story in there somewhere, its just not all on the screen. I think somewhere it got dumbed down or changed around. I blame Besson who must have been counting on the visuals to carry the film. You're not going to love it. I doubt anyone other than a small kid will love it- and odds are when they grow up they won't know why they loved it. Adults (or those passing as adults) will find it an okay time killer- though I do recommend waiting for video where the fast forward will make it easier to zip through the tough spots.If you're curious worth seeing- though wait for video",neutral,movie
76429,"Based on the novel by Claire Cook, the plot centers around a kindergarten teacher named Sarah Nolan (Lane), a divorcée who swears off men after a devastating divorce. However, her close-knit Irish-American family decides to 'help' her along by signing her up for a number of online dating programs. She then finds herself caught between two men, as she starts seeing the father of one her students (Mulroney) and a man who she meets through the dating service who seems far too perfect (Cusack).Must Love Dogs is a familiar yet enjoyable romantic comedy that should keep you entertained for a while. The plot is nothing new and there are many clichés to be found here yet the film is still funny. The film works well because of its two stars John Cusack and Diane Lane. They both give good, funny performances and they have nice chemistry together. If you enjoy watching these actors on screen then you should like the film. The supporting cast is also strong except for Dermot Mulroney. The good thing is that Dermot is not in the film very much so he does not suck out too much from the picture. This is his third film from 2005 and he was horrible in every one of them yet he keeps getting hired. The rest of the supporting cast consists of Elizabeth Perkins, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing and Julie Gonzalo.A few things are keeping me from rating the film higher. One of the reasons is of course Dermot Mulroney. The film also has a few annoying clichés that are hard to ignore. There were also a few bad stereotypes that were not needed and they were not funny at all. Even though the film does have its share of funny moments, it becomes dull from time to time. The film, for the most part, is safe and this movie could have easily been an episode of Friends or something. That does not mean it's a bad film, it's just a little sitcom-ish. If you do give the film a shot, don't take it too seriously and try to have a little fun with it. In the end, Must Love Dogs is a surprisingly enjoyable romantic comedy. Rating 7/10",neutral,movie
76441,"Naturally, I was intrigued by ""The Captive"", great plot and amazing actors, what could possibly go wrong? From the start, I could tell this movie was going to have a ton of flashbacks, which is fine, until those flashbacks kinda become irrelevant because the viewer has no idea which flashback comes first. Strike 1. The introduction of Scott Speedman was a treat, until he was a bit weird acting and since that was never explained, I guess that was just his character?.. Then the part where Ryan Reynolds character has an abusive past was brought up (in reference to plot), then was never to be heard of again. Strike 2. Still don't know much about the wife's character. Strike 3. No explanation about the relationship of the two detectives (Dawson & Speedman) but since Dawson seemed to have a picture of Speedman's niece in her office, it's to be assumed they're in a relationship. OK. And for the focus to be the family of the missing girl, I feel it rarely focused on them. Strike 4. This movie just needed a lot of tweaking. Starting with some back story of the characters at the beginning. And less flashbacks. More explanations. And more focus on how the unit was actually working towards finding the missing child.",neutral,movie

76641,"I wasn't overly impressed by this movie, mostly because of the script. Hollywood is not very imaginative when it comes to think outside the box, thus all films follow the magic and boring formula of ""a beginning, a middle and an end"". And when Hollywood decides to go wild and add something else to that concept, it usually ends up spoiling the movie. They did it in this flick. I'm not about to reveal anything but it has to do with Jason Biggs character.Still, the movie has it's moments. All ghost movies has that in common that there comes a time when a medium or similar relates what the ghost is saying to a loved one who can't see it. We saw it done better in ""Ghost"" with Demi More, Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg, and more recently in much funnier movie ""Ghosttown"", with Ricky Gervais. This movie has that scene too, but the disappointing script passes over it too quickly and with not much result for the plot.The highlight of the movie is the acting of two leads; Paul Rudd and the surprisingly funny Lake Bell.I've long had a growing admiration for Rudd, who has developed a style similar to that of Chevy Chase at his best. If ever a serious production of sequels to the Fletch movies gets a green light, the casting agent would do wisely in considering Rudd.Lake Bell is rather new to me, and I was severely impressed by her comedy talent. She could easily be pictured in over-the-top comedy things and take on a female lead over Jim Carreys character in ""Dumb & dumber"" or Ben Stillers in ""There's something about Mary"". The Farrelly brothers could have a new star in her.In conclusion, this film was watchable. ""Ghosttown"" is a better movie in all considerations, but Rudd and Bell are a joy.",neutral,movie

76809,"Very surprised that the critics gave this a thumbs up. It's possibly among the worst Star Wars movies (including the prequels). It's entertaining, for sure, but in the way David and Jerry Zucker films of the 80's were crowd pleasers. This isn't something you go home thinking about or affecting you when you go home, at least in a good way.The problem as I see it is that it tried to tackle too much in one movie. Worst, it spent so much time on unimportant (and seemingly inconsequential) events and not enough time on the bigger questions that were left hanging from TFA. The story structure is a mess. The Finn/Rose subplot could've been totally removed, and the new characters introduced were a waste of time.Characterizations were very inconsistent. Characters who had already grown in TFA (Finn, Poe) suddenly regressed for no reason. Major characters (Rey, Kylo, Luke) would make surprising moves without any basis or set-up, for the sake of surprise. In fact a lot of the movie can be said as favoring a ""twist"" happening at the expense of consistent character development. The prequel movies' treatment of Anakin's character development was a lot more satisfying, AND that's a generally panned. At least the prequel movies' story tried in earnest, TLJ did worst that just phoning it in.As some movies have become acclaimed films over time after an initial bashing by the critics (e.g. Bladerunner), this one I believe will take the opposite direction.Here's hoping JJ fixes everything with IX.",neutral,movie
76817,"I saw this movie over the weekend. When it was over, I kind of sighed, shrugged and said it was okay.I gave the movie a 5 which I think is pretty darn generous. Here's the positives of the movie. The actors are very good. Hugh Jackman, Liev, Ryan Reynolds are all very good actors, and each of them play their roles well. There was action, action, explosions, and more explosions. There certainly wasn't any shortage of eye candy. I think most Wolverine fans would probably like this movie.Here's the negatives. We all learned the hard way when X-Men 3 came out, that Fox could seem to care less about the source material. They just want to make action moves with lots of special effects. Wolverine is a testament to that same disappointing philosophy. While Wolverine fans may like the movie, ""Marvel"" fans will probably feel a little ill.I'm surprised that they haven't figured out yet why Marvel's movies are blockbusters (Iron Man, The Hulk), and thiers are always sub-par. Marvel uses good stories, acting, and smart witty scripts to keep us interested. Every half baked, killed off for the movie, or completely ruined character Fox throws in there just ruins the experience for a fan somewhere. Marvel may modernize the stories, but they respect the source material. Not only does that make comic fans happy, but the stories tend to make more sense, and have more relatable characters.On a side note, the fact that Fox apparently has the rights to Deadpool makes me want to cry. Give it back to Marvel so we can get a decent movie, without blades coming out of his arms and lasers out his eyes.",neutral,movie
76827,"First of all, my two favourites superheroes ever are Spiderman and Wolverine. Hence it's sad to me see that sometimes they do weak movies with these characters. I agree that the Tim Story's The fantastic four, Daredevil, Elektra, Spiderman 3, Ang Lee's Hulk and first Wolverine weren't too good, a bit silly but at least they were funny and entertaining. The major problem with this The Wolverine is that it's boring as hell, primarily the 40 minutes in the center of the story; the final twist is very predictable; the plot it's too easy; and they could have make the most of the Viper character. I liked 3:10 to Yuma, Copland and Walk the line and found amusing Night and Day, but James Mangold isn't an appropriate director for a Marvel movie. The best part is the extra scene few after the ending credits begin(I don't spoil it, don't worry) Values added are the beauty of Tao Okamoto that I think it's accurate to the Chris Claremont/John Byrne depiction of Mariko in the comic-books and Rila Fukusima performs a correct sidekick as Yukio. I bet that (sadly) there's not going to be a third Wolverine movie because this one is going to bomb at the box office. Specially after the first week word of mouth. My recommendation: as I would like to see a third one (hoping to see finally a good Wolverine movie), go to watch it, but if I have to be honest, save your money and wait to see it at home (cause is going to be cheaper the waste).",neutral,movie

But I was VERY disappointed with the movie.Yes, there were some good things in the movie. There were some excellent ISOLATED SCENES. There were good visuals HERE AND THERE. The soundtrack was USUALLY good. SOME OF THE ACTORS did well. I'll admit all of that.But.The other 75% of the movie was lacking. I'm not sure why people are saying the movie was ""faithful to the games"" when the plot line was completely INCOMPATIBLE with the one in the games. Some characters were the different, and some characters were the same but the events surrounding them were different. But either way, it just didn't match up to the well-established story we know and love.There were also a lot of moments where the atmosphere was not at all like what the games give us! The games are about loneliness, and isolation. In the games, there are never more than three people (or monsters) in a room at once. No, that's not because of technological limitations -- it's because the designers deliberately planned it that way. The movie, on the other hand, has several crowd scenes. In case you missed it, I'll repeat that -- CROWD SCENES. IN SILENT HILL. What??? Silent Hill is not supposed to be a place where you have a room with twenty people in it. Nor it is a place where you have a hallway with twenty monsters in it. That's ridiculous. It ruins the whole effect.And speaking of ""ruining the effect,"" let's talk about how often this movie has us LEAVE Silent Hill. The games remove us from the setting SOMETIMES, and VERY SLIGHTLY. The movie, on the other hand, removes us from it FREQUENTLY, and VERY SEVERELY. Right after a creepy scene in the foggy snow, it will suddenly cut to a screen full of bright green trees and blue sky -- two things that have NO PLACE in a Silent Hill movie.Like I said, the movie did a lot of things right. But not nearly enough to carry the weight of the entire movie. I found myself shaking my head and sighing JUST AS OFTEN as I found myself impressed, if not more so. It does do a lot to make fans of the series happy, but it also does quite a lot to make them furious. The bottom line is, the Silent Hill series is something I love and feel protective over, and when people sully its good name I feel offended. Five stars out of ten.",neutral,movie
77043,"I was never really a fan of the first movie, I thought it was a good premise but was poorly put together and the situations they found themselves in the first movie is just way out there. The Penguin quartet stole that show for me and was the only humorous thing that kept the movie from falling apart. I just saw this sequel just for the heck of it and in my opinion, this is a step above from its predecessor but however, not that big of a deal to me. I saw it, I laughed three or four times and maybe tomorrow I'll forget it. Its the same old schtick you saw in the first one, even that annoying old lady returns and your favorite castaways still find themselves in hilarious situations that are way out there.It was a good thing that they added more characters but it almost felt like they were just there for decoration. Maybe throw in a couple of hilarious quips and do something that a normal animal won't do and that's that. And like in the first movie, the Penguins still stole everyone's thunder and still kept the movie from falling apart. Forget the part where a shark hops and skips across the barren wildlife of Africa and the idea of an old lady going Rocky on an adult lion, I just wanted to see these penguins cause trouble but now in a different location. They deserve a spin-off, stat.",neutral,movie
77084,"Antoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven is about as brazen as the cowboys it portrays. It is loud, visceral and action packed but lacks the necessary functions for it to be a truly great film. Despite Fuqua's most confident directing and Denzel Washington's excellent performance, the film ends up being as cluttered as the cast would suggest. When it all comes down to it, it is a matter of an overload of star power. While there have been films in the past that have had incredible casts and flourished, this film makes it feel as though the film is only big enough for one star. Chris Pratt is great as an alcoholic and incredibly ballsy gunslinger, Faraday, but he lacks any gusto to really command the screen as does most of the cast outside of Denzel Washington (someone who I can't say enough good things about here). It ends up feeling like these roles could have been played by anyone when it should have felt like these actor's owned these roles so much so that you can't imagine anyone else in it. Unfortunately that isn't the case here. Quite frankly, the only performances worth noting are Washington and Peter Sarsgaard, who gives a devilishly good performance as a sadistic law man. In this respect, the film is very much a disappointment for anyone expecting to see the next great ensemble film of the year. More importantly, those of you who were excited to see the re-teaming of the Training Day squad (Washington, Hawke and Fuqua) will have to wait a bit longer for that because there is barely any chemistry between Ethan Hawke's Goodnight Robicheaux and Washington's Chisolm. The screenplay, written by True Detective's Nic Pizzolatto and action aficionado, Richard Wenk is lackluster to say the least. As I said, the character development with the characters is either not there or so forced and unnatural that it takes you out of it. After the abysmal season 2 of True Detective and this, I think is safe to say that Pizzolatto is turning into the one hit wonder that everyone feared that he would be. However, I will still hold off on officially saying that about him because there are some ideas that were introduced in the film that were really interesting which is why it is all the more frustrating when they are cast aside and never touched upon again. The screenplay is the big problem here. It is well paced but emotionally hollow. It never really reaches anywhere near the heights of the Kurosawa masterpiece or even the 1957 remake that that film spawned. In this case, the script reads and sounds like a bad imitation. Despite this, The Magnificent Seven does boasts some pretty exceptional action set pieces much to Fuqua's credit. The film is explosive but it is highly predictable. Those who are killed don't really resonate with the viewer because quite honestly, we don't care about any of the characters outside of Washington. They are mere footnotes to the larger picture which is a monumental disappointment. Overall, I thought that Antoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven boasted a great idea and never truly capitalized on it. The film felt like it really could have been something but we are left holding on to the idea of what could have been.",neutral,movie
77241,"The movie was not worth our time or money. Me being a guy did not, and I stress, did not wanted to watch this movie. But my girlfriend dragged me into watching it. I cannot say I enjoyed the movie, but all the actors preformed well. I liked the roll played by Richard Jenkins. He and Channing Tatum had a good father-son relationship on screen. (Better than his relationship with Amanda Seyfried). The plot was very week and did not develop the characters well. The movie overall lacked spark. It is too long and boring. However, the cinematography was very good. I would rather spend my money on a nonsense action or comedy flick than this mombo jumbo.",neutral,movie
77280,"Green Zone is billed as an action film that's really a paint by the numbers political thriller that isn't very, well ... thrilling. First off, the film had no exciting plot twists. The story is all plot sprinkled with zero character development topped with redundant layers of theme. The theme, that ""evil government lies to the people, etc..."", can be interesting but when it's so thickly thrust into a script with such shallow, one-dimensional characters I find it hard to swallow (and it's not like I don't believe the GOV doesn't lie to us either -by both reps and dems). Secondly, after Matt Damon's impressive performance in The Informant I was ready for another. Not this time. He plays Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller like a wet leaf, a John Wayne""esquire"" type antihero who ""plays by his own rules"" which seems VASTLY out of place for a character in the U.S. Military. It was more like Damon was the throw-caution-to-the-wind spy, Jason Bourne, who had gone to Iraqi to find the missing WMD's than a realistic depiction of an Army soldier. Finally, the film contained only two intensive action sequences, neither which were very exciting. The overall cinematography was unimpressive, lacking and was wrought with an overuse of hand held camera work. I suppose since it's P. Greengrass I should expect it but come'on, can you give us a break once in a while from the shaky cam (I'm getting a headache)? If you want a tension filled, beautifully shot war film please see the Hurt Locker. Overall, this film deserves five stars or a weak 6, if you're feeling generous. Definitely a rental (enjoyed Body of Lies more). Oh, and if you're getting up on your high horse about how ""anti-war this"" or ""anti-gov that"" this film is then I think you missed the point. It's simple ENTERTAINMENT created to make MONEY. Sure, the film has a strong political theme but it's called ""show BUSINESS"" for a reason and it's not because it's called ""show POLITICS"" (like Fox News or Michael Moore).",neutral,movie
77301,I had my expectations high because I was very impressed with the first one. Unfortunately this one is a bit of a disappointment owing to the pacing and predictability of the story. It was slower and boring. If they decide to make a third one then they should make it a bit more fast paced.,neutral,movie
77328,"Greetings again from the darkness. I guess this qualifies as director Oliver Stone returning to his dark side. Based on Don Winslow's novel, it certainly has the foundation to be a complex, down-and-dirty, twisted plot, double-crossing, love triangle, ultra-violent, drug-dealing smörgåsbord. And while it possesses all of those elements, it still manages to come across as some slick Michael Mann cable TV project.The film begins with narration from O (Blake Lively) who tells us that just because she is telling us this story, doesn't mean she is alive at the end. Huh?? She also tells us that she is in love with two drug-dealing buddies. Yes, both of them. Chon (Taylor Kitsch) is the ex-Seal and muscle in the business. Ben (Aaron Johnson) is the gifted botanist who turns the Afghan seeds into the most potent pot in southern California. Oh, and Ben is the ultimate philanthropist drug dealer. He builds schools in third world countries and invests in clean energy. After what felt like an eternity, the narration finally ended and I could stop yelling ""Shut up, O"" at the screen.One day the boys receive a video via email. It's an invitation to a business meeting with the Mexican Baja Drug cartel. Suffice to say that the video contained no balloons or party animals. It was more of a warning about what happens if you choose not to do business with us. The cartel front men are played by Demian Bichir (fresh off A Better Life) and Benecio Del Toro (MIA since The Wolfman). The queen of the cartel is Elena, played by Salma Hayak. Throw in a corrupt DEA agent, playing both sides against each other, portrayed by John Travolta and all the pieces are in place for real fireworks once O is kidnapped.The rest of the movie is pretty much the war you would expect with some poor negotiation skills tossed in for fun. Overacting is the word of the day, especially from Travolta, Ms. Hayak and Emile Hirsch (money man). Still not sure what to make of Ms. Lively (The Town). The camera certainly loves her but it's too early to tell if she has staying power as an actress. The only character that is really fun to watch is Lado, played by Del Toro. He is truly a frightening guy who also happens to have a deceptive mind on how to take over from the weak.The whole good versus evil story line really only works if one side is good and one side is evil. If the good side (Ben) is a drug-dealer in a love triangle with his best friend, it's much more difficult to muster empathy. Otherwise, when the mandatory hostage/money exchanges occur, we really aren't invested in the characters ... and the action takes center stage. That's the sign of a forgettable movie with no real heart.",neutral,movie
77335,"The movie sets out to imbue one with a sense of ol' seaman adventure and intrigue, but very soon falls into mediocrity with at best borderline competency. The premise holds neither interest nor meaning - you think a scene would lead somewhere, but scene after scene it just leads to ""so what?, who cares?"" territory. Scripting is a huge problem - dialogues are mundane, pretentious and stilted. None of the characters capture any attention as characters. Chris Hemsworth got to count on his good looks and appealing voice to generate interest, and little from the character. Brendan Gleeson's character (his acting is fine) turns out to be just downright pathetic and plain silly, and not the ol' seaman with a woe-so-great gravitas the character was supposed to be. The talents of the likes of Cillian Murphy wasted on another pointless character. Ben Whishaw's character is just childishly idealistic and annoying to boot. Other cookie-cutter characters whisk in and out with no depth nor believable motivation. The premise of many scenes make little sense. Supposed experienced seamen simply lounging in an empty boat with no capabilities of open seas survival is laughable - even our boy from Life of Pi did better. Simply drawing lots as to who will get cannibalized next - huh? And scattering human bones of comrades you ate inside a tiny boat - huh? The whales, especially 'the' whale, should be an important 'character' requiring development - however, it is just made to be a lumbering vengeance seeking bully, a visual tail flipping thingy. Nothing else.The only reason to see this is for Chris Hemsworth good looks and the fact that currently there is no other ol' seaman movie around - so this soulless 'Heart of the Sea"" is both the best and worst there is at Dec 2015.",neutral,movie
77341,"There's a fair amount of fun to be had with this film. It doesn't take itself seriously or bother going too deep. The tone is bright and happy and it makes for perfect mindless entertainment.

It's all harmless stuff with some neat fight scenes that never get too violent and a gleefully light-hearted sense of humor.Randy Edelman's generic Western score is terrible (as usual) and sounds like everything else he's ever done only with a few notes changed.

77426,"The fine cast assembled for this film makes me wonder what they saw in the script. Was it a matter of one actor signing on, and others wanting to work with him (I say him because the only female in the film is Zoe Saldana, in a one-dimensional and thankless role). Was it that the director used to be an actor and knows all these people? Was it because he had success with Crazy Heart?Other reviews basically already touch on the problems here: it means nothing. I wanted to like the film, but I walked out of the theater not knowing what I had just seen (the ending is confusing, ridiculous, and poorly done). The film takes itself far too seriously to get away with just being entertaining, and when you don't have a clue what the whole point of the movie was, that's a bad thing. Things happen in the film without really coming together and create a cohesive narrative where you feel that there's any growth or direction. Perhaps that's the intent, but any theme or themes were underdeveloped and not apparent. I find the comparisons to Deerhunter insulting, personally.The actors do a fine job, although I feel there is some miscasting in the movie. Would Forest Whitaker really be able to attract Zoe Saldana? Nothing in the movie gave me any reason to think they had a believable relationship. Frankly, nothing in the film convinced me that Saldana would even stay in a town like Braddock. Bale is good, as is Affleck and Harrelson, but I didn't really connect with anyone except Affleck's character. Definitely a missed opportunity and a disappointment.",neutral,movie
77463,"All and all, not a particularly enjoyable film.This movie sacrifices all that was interesting about the novel in the first place just to squeeze in all the historical aspects. All of the page turning scenes in the book that would have been interesting to see translated to screen (Anne's bloodstained dress, the deformed child, the courtship between Mary and William) were cut.Fortuanatly, I expected that. With such a long book, I had to expect most of my favourite scenes were going to get the axe.What I didn't expect was for the narration to change from that of Mary (aka. ""The Other Boelyn Girl"" for which the book was named) to yet another story about Anne Boelyn. The film started off well, if rather slow, with the story being told from Mary, but it quickly changes gears as the audience is suddenly following Anne's courtship of Henry and Anne's trials, emotions and desperation. Mary is quickly delegated to little more then a secondary role, with many key moments happening while she isn't on screen.The story of Anne was told well, she was portrayed brilliantly by Portman, and had several fun and emotional moments. But that's just the problem, I've seen that all before. There have been dozens of films, series, and books written from Anne's point of view. If I wanted to see a story about Anne, I would have watched Anne of the Thousand Days or maybe ""The Tudors"" HBO series. What made this story special was it told the story behind Anne and Henry (and it was mostly fictional which added to the drama). Unfortunately the movie ignored this, and thus failed to create the same reaction I had towards the book. Another problem is that of characterisation, I expected that the movie would make the two sisters friends as it creates more drama towards the end as opposed to them being not particularly close like in the book. Same with the enormous changes they made in the personalities of the parents (and honestly, almost every character)I expected it. Many of the characters in the movie were actually more two-dimensional then the callous characters from the book. It wasn't as though this movie was badly acted or written...it was just bad.The person I was most disappointed about was George (one of my favourites in the book) who was given a woefully small role, although the actor who portrayed him did it brilliantly. Also, The character of William Stafford seemed to be added in as an afterthought which confused the audience who hadn't read the book (the two main questions I heard were ""Is that the guy she married in the beginning"" or ""What happened to the guy she married in the beginning"") and left those of us who had read the book wondering why he was portrayed as such a pansy?And the editing, where to begin. Horrible, the particularly poignant scenes (few and far between as they were) were not given enough time to sink in before the audience was whisked off to another scene. Even having read the source material I was lost, so I can only imagine how it must have been from those new to the story. The only bright side of this tedious film were the beautiful costumes, but even the bright colours and swirly dresses couldn't distract anyone with more then a 10 second attention span and despite them the movie soon became unbearably boring.All in all, this movie probably shouldn't have been made in the first place. It was apparent there was too much story to tell in two hours, it had mini-series written all over it. But seeing as it had to be made for the film industry to cash in the the books success, it could have been done a lot better.",neutral,movie
77476,"Hunker down, kiddies, it's time for a two-hour schmaltz-a-thon. This movie not only tugs at your heartstrings, it rips the strings out and whips you with them. Subtlety ain't this film's strong suit.Nicolas Cage plays a slick Wall Street powerbroker (the only kind in Hollywood, and probably real life as well) who has it all: money, money, money, and power. Jack Campbell's lacking a family, but he doesn't see that as a bad thing. He's also driven, obsessed with improving the company he works for - he even schedules a ""crisis meeting"" on Christmas Day. This guy's got balls, all right. He's making loot hand over fist, and he's probably on his way to an ulcer or a heart attack before he hits fifty.On Christmas Eve, he gets a phone message from an ex-girlfriend (Tea Leoni). Years earlier, the two of them had made a decision crucial to their lives - he went to England to intern with a prestigious bank, and she went to one of the finest law schools in the country. This facilitated their breakup, but since Jack's made out rather well in the interim, he pays the call little mind. Then that night, he stops by a convenience store to pick up some egg nog. An irate lottery player (the always reliable and watchable Don Cheadle) pulls a gun on the clerk behind the counter. Jack offers to buy the man's lottery ticket in an effort to calm the situation, and even attempts to rehabilitate the hoodlum. ""Cmon,"" Jack tells him, ""everyone needs something."" ""What do you need?"" Cash asks him. Jack considers the point, then replies there's nothing he needs. ""Ok,"" says Cash, ""but just remember, you got yourself into this."" Hmm.The next morning, Jack wakes up in bed with the lovely, the delicious, the married-in-real-life-to-David Duchovny Tea Leoni. And he has two kids. And a dog. And whoa! This isn't Jack's life, is it? He doesn't like kids! And here they come, bouncing on the bed he shares with Kate. It's Christmas Day, after all. But Jack's in shock. He panics, grabs the keys to their minivan (Hey! Where's his Porsche?) and dashes off to the city. What's going on?Seems Cash is some kinda sorta angel or something (it's never really explained), and he's offering Jack a ""glimpse"" of what his life would havebeen like if he had stuck with Kate back in the day. Now, those of us who are of a certain age do wonder from time to time what life would have been like if different decisions had been made. Jack's problem is that his wonderment is now his reality. And it's most certainly not the reality he's looking for! The Single Jack is a hedonist who recognizes only responsibilities to his job. The Married Jack pays more attention to his familial responsibilities.So we have a general fish-out-of-water scenario. Jack knows he's Single Jack, and naturally he has neither knowledge nor memory of life as Married Jack. He doesn't know his friends, his in-laws, his co-workers (he works as a tire salesman!), nothing. He doesn't even know where he lives! Ah yes, mad hijinks ensue. It's like in that Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show - the audience is in on the joke, but the lead character has no idea. See Jack stumble over gettin' jiggy with his wife! See him mumble greetings to friends he doesn't know! See him stand with his mouth agape most of the time, trying in vain to absorb everything.And, of course, see Jack wrap things up neatly. Too bad it's a two-hour sojourn into schmaltz, though. The problem with the movie isn't that it's sentimental, it's that it's a preachy film, desperate to teach us that Marriage Is Good. And think about it - how many guys do you know are married to someone who looks like Tea Leoni (and is a nice person, too), who goes to work at a tire place with a song in their hearts, who has a loving family with two perfect kids? This life doesn't exist, and damn this movie for making the married versus single issue seem so black and white. Single >bad, marriage = good.The best sentimental films teach lessons with such subtlety that you don't realize you've learned anything until well after the closing credits have rolled. The worst of these films takes a lesson that most people know anyway and proceeds to whack the living crap out of you with it. Ok, ok! I get it! Married life = good things. Got it, ok. And thankfully, Jack got it, too, or we'd still be watching this drivel.",neutral,movie
77527,"It's actually a very interesting basic premise: primitive barbaric alien invaders versus juvenile London street gangs At least it's a whole lot more interesting than aliens versus cowboys, which is a concept that some big shots in Hollywood also tried recently. And straight from the opening sequences, it's made clear that the film's main strong point will become character authenticity. ""Attack the Block"" is set in South London, where writer/director Joe Cornish also actually grew up, and opens immediately with the assault of a young woman by a an aggressive and lawless gang of underage hoodlums. The sequence is very realistic, especially if you watch the news bulletins every now and then, and because of the assailants' ages also deeply disturbing. But hey, that's just the way it is nowadays Kids, barely fifteen or sixteen year old, are roaming the big European city streets at night and don't hesitate to rob, injury, rape or even murder other civilians for a small sum of money. This exact same bunch of youthful thugs subsequently then goes to war against an underdeveloped race of alien invaders that literally comes falling out of the sky like meteors. It is here already that the film's main strong point threatens to become a giant obstacle. Are we supposed to cheer for teenage thugs that narrowly just mugged and gang-raped an innocent women? Are we supposed to feel empathy when they look as terrified of the aliens as their victims look terrified of them? But director Joe Cornish and his cast of inexperienced youngsters surprisingly enough accomplish that we gradually (very gradually at the beginning) go from tolerating the protagonists to actually rooting for them. At the end of the film, the protagonists are still scumbags, but at least they demonstrated courage, loyalty and self-sacrifice. And besides, it's not like you can cheer for the aliens in this case, neither They aren't well organized and super-intelligent beings with a detailed plan to take over our planet, but primitive canine beasts with fluorescent blue teeth and impenetrable black fur. The characters refer to pretty much every semi-classical Sci-Fi/Fantasy flick to describe them (""Gremlins"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Harry Potter"") but the aliens actually look the most like a crossover between ""Critters"" and ""American Werewolf in London"". """"Attack the Block"" contains plenty of bloody action and harsh violence, but sadly the film rapidly gets boring and repetitive. There's a lack of variance in decors and filming locations (the aliens literally just attack the block and nothing else) and all too often director Cornish wants to imitate the raw impact of ""Assault on Precinct 13"". Nick Frost is, in fact, rather redundant as the über-relaxed weed dealer, but it's presumably thanks to his name on the posters that many genre fans wanted to see the film. Along with Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright (here the executive producer), Nick Frost uplifted the British horror and cult industry with ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". The concept gimmick is original and dared, the performances are as good as natural and there are a handful of terrific Sci-Fi/horror sequences, but overall seen ""Attack the Block"" remains a modest and forgettable effort.",neutral,movie

Despite the at times dramatic and soaring cinematography, the bland dialog and uninteresting script make this movie a snooze-fest. The film starts off slow, and maintains this crawling pace for the duration. To be fair, there was a semi-interesting shootout scene in the Gugenheim that captivated my attention for all of 7 minutes. But as quickly as this short burst of entertainment stealthily snuck up on me, it faded before I could completely shake myself from my slumber. All in all, I generously gave The International a 5 for a laudable effort in the acting department and from a filming and cinematic perspective, but as a whole, the story never comes together.

Yesterday was 2nd of Advent and I was in the mood for something ""Christmasy"" so when I saw that this movie was given on Paramount Channel I (actually we the family) decided to sit down and watch it.Unfortunately this attempt to modernize Dickens' old classic is met with, at best, a moderate success. Bill Murray is doing a good effort with the role he has been given. Actually, he being in the movie was one of the reasons that I decided to have a go at watching it. However the movie never really moves beyond being yet another rather mediocre comedy.His old ""friend"" visiting him as a dead guy and the first ghost was both quite cool and up to that point the movie was quite okay. However when the second ghost comes in the form of some wacky, sadistic fairy then it started to go downhill. She was not really funny and Frank's going more and more loony was not very funny either. The third ghost was rather meh.Sure there are a few laughs sprinkled around but not enough to elevate the movie to the heights that I was hoping from a movie with Bill Murray and based on Dickens' story. Most importantly, I never really got that nice and cozy Christmas tale feeling when watching the movie. The ending with the lunatic and disjointed speech by Frank was quite a letdown as far as I am concerned.The movie was good enough that the evening did not feel like a real waste but that is about it.",neutral,movie
77748,"It's been a whopping 25 years since Steve Spielberg's last real children's film, when he disappointed children and adults alike with his Peter Pan re-imagining Hook. After a long period of going back and forth between monochromatic, Oscar-wary history lessons and crowd-pleasing blockbuster fare, Hollywood's most famous director is back trying to win the hearts of both children and parents as he did with one of his most celebrated movies, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), with a passion project he's been considering for some time. He also reunites with E.T. screenwriter Melissa Mathison (who sadly died last year) to bring the notoriously tricky world of Roald Dahl to the big screen.Insomniac orphan Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) spends her nights either beneath her blanket pouring over books or roaming the halls of the orphanage looking for anything that may spark her interest. While up late one night, she shushes some drunks staggering home from the pub, only to glimpse the shadow of what looks like a giant hooded man. The figure gets closer and closer, until a giant hand reaches in through her window and whisks her and blanket both across the country. The mysterious monstrosity turns out to be a giant indeed, but a big, friendly one, played in motion capture by a wonderful Mark Rylance. The BFG is the runt of his litter in Giant Country, and is routinely bullied by the much bigger fellow giants that lurk on the land outside of his cave. The two outcasts will form a bond that will see their two worlds unite.Brian Cosgrove's beloved animated film from 1989 was incredibly close to the book, and was said to be a personal favourite of Dahl's. Yet a faithful page-to-screen adaptation of a terrific piece of literature doesn't necessarily result in a good movie, and having watched the cartoon relatively recently, I didn't find it very entertaining. Spielberg's update also stays quite close to Dahl's text, and it suffers from the same saggy narrative as the much shorter movie that came before did. Anyone hoping to keep their children entertained for a couple of hours may find them getting restless, as Spielberg is happy to take his time exploring this strange land. It's a decision I applaud, but it doesn't excuse an incredibly slow middle-section, as the BFG introduces the world of dream-catching, snozzcumbers and the joys of farting to the precocious Sophie, complete with rambling monologues and existential pondering.There's also a noticeable reluctance to explore the darker areas of the book, with the giants (played like Cockney bouncers by the likes of Jemaine Clement and Bill Hader) failing to live up their names (Fleslumpeater, Bloodbottler, Bonecruncher). They instead come across as bullying buffoons and not the child-munching monsters they are meant to be. If there is one thing the film gets totally right, it is with the casting of Rylance, fresh off his Oscar win for Bridge of Spies (2015). The wonderful effects by Weta perfectly capture the warmth and innocence of his performance, and his line delivery is pitch- perfect. Spielberg also goes all-out with Dahl's bizarre finale, which sees Sophie recruit the Queen herself (Penelope Wilton) and her trusted butler Mr. Tibbs (Rafe Spall) in her fight against the evil giants of Giant Country. It's a truly weird climax, but it's the only consistently funny part of the movie. Not a total failure by any stretch of the imagination, but a somewhat rambling, timid effort to bring a difficult book to the screen.",neutral,movie

Major aspects of the story are changed, including the ending which is entirely different (for seemingly no reason other than to reduce length of the film) to the book - and this itself causes a huge plot inaccuracy. Also, we are given a significant clue as to who is the murderer very early on in the film. What is the point!? The character of Salander is destroyed by the director. She opens up way too much and shows a significant amount of emotional weakness, which we shouldn't see until the next film at least. The film artistry itself is hugely lacking. We are under the illusion that it is a film of incredible beauty and depth. I'm afraid not, this is just the Swedish countryside - possibly the only good thing about this film. We are soon met by lack-lustre screenplay writing and subsequently unnatural and contrived scenes with every character. I'm not easily offended but the unnecessary use of swear words (where no normal person would use them) and lengthy portrayal of rape and sex in this film was just not called for.

78108,"No need for a long review on this one.The acting was good for the most part all around. Thats about the only good part of the movie though.The music just doesn't fit a ""rocky"" movie. Sure it's a young modern fighter who is black and from LA, so maybe when a song plays we're supposedly listening to his headphones. Seems a little too cliché, that pretty much every song is hiphop or rap. I like rap, but it doesn't pump me up all that much. Not too mention unless you know the songs, they don't sound much different from each other in the clips they play. A balance would have been good, instead its mostly just loud rapping which sorta punches you out of the movie. But then again, the story is so incredibly predictable and forgettable that perhaps a gust of wind would take you out and a punch isn't necessary.The story is exactly what you think it is. Every scene will play out exactly how you think it will. When you're thinking ""oh.. the big downfall is gonna be any minute now"" it is. Then when you think, ""the big upswing is coming any min now"" it is. Whenever something is leading up to something you think will happen, you start thinking ""tell me they didn't actually get this predictably cheesy"" they did.The training was boring. Rocky training scenes were always the best part of the movie, these ones were completely boring. The fights.. ugh. I loved Rocky for the fights looking real, little to no blurry, echoey, slomo, ""deep thoughts"" style scenes mid fight. Was always action, looked like a real fight. The main fight here looked like a joke. Completely takes you out of the fight and the emotion. No one ever really looks like they're in much danger. No strategy or turning points are ever present. It was boring in that there wasn't much sway back and forth which can be realistic in pro boxing. But for a movie, the fight should be fun, engaging and exciting. There was nothing but montage-like, flashy, effect ridden montage of fight clips with an obviously green screened backdrop.You really don't care who wins by the end of the second round and the last minute of the fight is probably the worst acting/directing of an actor I've ever seen in my life. I'm assuming that wasn't Michael's decision but it looked STUPID. Horrible direction and choreography. The main opponent doesn't feel or seem like a ""boxer"" at all.Story is far-fetched and extremely predictable, not just the movie but the writing as well. Oh and I almost forgot there's a love interest in this one for the star... I almost forgot because it adds nothing and it's hollow.I didn't expect much from this since it's technically a revival and I know how those usually go. But I rather liked Rocky Balboa from 2006 for being actually entertaining and I thought I was going to be let down. This one delivered on the impending prediction of disappointment in that it wasn't really even entertaining.Good: acting sceneryBad: story music choreography direction characters (other than Adonis and Rocky)",neutral,movie
78138,"Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts. Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold? Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message). Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice. And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes, drunken bouts, weaning off drugs, spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic. Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given, does the result merit Oscar attention? That is up to the voters. It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy. But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies. Just not that impressed. Grady Harp",neutral,movie

78288,"I've enjoyed a good portion of Guy Ritchie's filmmaking. While many of his more recent movies rely on franchise appeal (Sherlock Holmes (2009), The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and Aladdin (2019) are of note), I usually associate his style of filmmaking with the British heist film (like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000)). Consequently, I was looking forward to seeing his recent film, The Gentlemen (2020), as it seemed to be a return to the kind of filmmaking that attracted me to Guy Ritchie films in the first place.Unfortunately, it seems Ritchie has been away from his core movies for so long that he's almost forgotten how to make them. The meta framing with Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam was clunky enough that even Hunnam's character was getting bored with the ""telling"" in the exposition provided by Grant's character. Sure, there were a few neat twists here and there, but it was trying so hard to be a meta-movie like Seven Psychopaths (2012) or The Player (1992) that it lost its focus. In the end, it spent too much time trying to interweave the narrator's narrative and the story narrative, and all it ended up with was a jumbled mess of a movie.I didn't feel like the action or cinematography (two elements that defined Ritchie films in the past) was lacking. This was mostly because so much of this movie is told to us via Hugh Grant. Perhaps this was also because the meaningful action didn't even end up being real, but rather the imagined ""movie version"" of events that played so counter to the characters and how they would act as to break the suspension of disbelief. I'd forgive doing this once, but it seemed to happen on more than one occasion, resulting in an annoying ""just kidding"" wink from the narrator far too often. At the very least, The Gentlemen does show the difference between boys trying to be tough and men who are actually tough.A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies, I give The Gentlemen 2.5 stars out of 5.",neutral,movie

Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy have no chemistry. Ultimately Neil Armstrong is a very dull characters without clear goals or ambition. Do not watch this film expecting triumphant or patriotic look at scientific discovery. It isn't that kind of film. It appears designed to elicit depression from the audience and it succeeds. One watches anxiously waiting for the climax, the moon landing, which feels anti-climactic and leaves viewers empty. Both the writer and director are out of their depth with this ambitious film.

78353,"I would have to agree that this show is totally over-hyped mainly because it was based on a best selling series ala the Twilight saga-turned- movie franchise. As best as the writers try to entice audiences with the convoluting plots and supposedly thickening suspenseful drama from week to week, the show has failed to keep the book's original storyline and the characters are not much what the book had depicted them to be. It is because teen-aged girls and fashion savvy women make up the audience which makes the show very popular. Its varying fashion pieces from episode to episode makes it worth watching and also thanks to its beautiful actors that compensate for a show that's almost devoid of quality. In the acting department, most of them rely on the script and their looks, showing not more than bland expressions throughout the season and sometimes looking as though they're reciting than really acting out a range of emotions. I should be a little benign to the actress who plays Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) because I felt she was the only one who could brilliantly capture her character best and was able to deliver most of her lines memorably. So I beg the question, should you watch the show? Personally, yes if you are missing entertainment from your life and no, if you already have sufficient drama in yours.",neutral,movie
78394,"Cold Mountain alternates between the stories of Nicole Kidman, waiting at home for her sweetheart to return from the civil war, and Jude Law, her sweetheart trying to find his way back to her. For conflict we have a rather nasty band of home guard who race around killing deserters... But Jude Law is a deserter... oh no! Run, Jude, run!Another period tragedy masquerading as romance adapted from a famous novel by Anthony Minghella. This time its a sweethearts separated by the civil war ""tell me a tale"" story. The plot is Mills and Boone / Midday Melodrama, but so exquisitely filmed with such an exquisite soundtrack that we hardly notice. It maintains a sombre tone throughout, and goes for tears almost non-stop.I've pinned down the fatal flaw with the film. I felt that Kidman and Law had zero chemistry: that the film worked, but when the two finally met up, it felt wrong, like they were two separate satellites, individually fine, but there was nothing between them. Its built into the structure of the movie. The two hardly know each other before he goes off to war: they kiss, she gives him a photo and speaks in a poor southern accent, and that's it. Then they spend the entire movie not sharing the screen. They have their completely separate story-lines: him at war, and then journeying back to her; her at home waiting for him. So by the time they finally meet, we have gotten to know them both as independent from each other - and somehow this fits. Which is why it seems wrong once they're together. And there's the fact that Kidman is an ICE QUEEN!She's becoming increasingly cold and distant - and looking more and more like Vivien Leigh. If she's not careful, she may just end up like Vivien. Her career is in danger of disappearing if she doesn't come back down to earth, experience the real world and real people again.For a female protagonist in this film we needed somebody who the audience could associate with, imprint themselves on - instead we have someone with only relevance to her insulated celluloid world than to us, the audience. She's like a porcelain doll: elegant, but nothing to do with reality.Zellweger is a definite scene-stealing highlight. A unique, vibrant character - almost a broad character, but not a 2D character.5/10. Everything about its look is 10/10 stuff. Superb cinematography, great performances from Jude Law, albeit iffy southern accents right the way through, and despite the fact that I did not like Kidman at all in this, I enjoyed it, but its flawed, to my mind, by the lack of a chemistry, and Nicole Kidman's unwelcoming, mannered persona.",neutral,movie

Since about only 40% of this movie is fictional it is hard to give this movie any credit for being historically correct. Robin Williams is funny as always, still the movie plays both sides of the fence, most of the time, leaning on the anti-war side. Without Robin Williams, you have a story which is suppose to be a comedy about the Vietnam war. Hard to do, and without taste, if I may add. A nice movie, but far from anything timeless or terrific.

78490,"As a standalone film this was funny and nice to look at, but as a sequel it was terrible. Thus overall it was average. Wreck it Ralph is one of my favorite animated films - it managed to be an homage to retro gaming whilst telling a story about a misguided but loveable 'bad guy' finding out what really matters in life.Ralph Breaks The Internet undoes all the good the first one did - Ralph is now an abusive (or should I say 'insecure') friend who has not one, but TWO cliche 'We were best friends and everything was perfect but now you did something that's upset me so I'm going to walk away and DON'T FOLLOW ME moments'. The film lacks any subtletly in dealing with its themes of toxic relationships (both personal and over the internet), and is far more comfortable in its amusing Internet references than it is in trying to make a statement.There were so many missed opportunities to link it with the first film. For example, it is made clear that the allure of modern games is that they're constantly being updated and feel new. This was the perfect chance for the film to show that retro games, that always stay the same and live in our memory, have merit too. But nope, that didn't happen. To me, it feels like a Disney exec wanted to tell a story of the dangers / joys of the internet, and the dangers / joys of clingy friendships, but forced these messages into Wreck it Ralph where it just doesn't fit. It's used as a vehicle for this message, weaving its way around a bombardment of internet references in trying to do so.I can understand why people enjoyed it - I laughed a lot during the first half, and one or two of the emotional moments were quite powerful. But in lacking any nuance or any reverence to the first film, I cannot recommend it to fans of the first.",neutral,movie

The first was a force of nature that gripped you from the beginning and took you on an adventure in a world foreign to most of us. And it was hilarious, filled with unforgettable scenes and belly laughs. This sequel is a nostalgic, where are they know, look back at the main characters from the original.It starts out choppy, never picks up a real driving force, and kind of meanders around until it finds a way to end. Begbie is supposed to be the villain that makes this thing move, but the rest of the crew aren't stupid kids anymore, and the fear he instills in the other characters just doesn't seem genuine. The Veronika character seems so forced. There's no groundwork laid to set up her relationship with Sick Boy or Renton. Her character is just too wise and put together to be a hooker hanging out with this sad lot of old junkies.Trainspotting had a compelling dynamic based on doomed friendships of young junkies, and the attempt to escape the impending doom by the protagonist. There was a force driving the movie from start to end. And there were non-stop laughs along the way mixed in with junkie philosophy and trippy drug-fueled scenes. That's all missing in this sad sequel, which walks in the footsteps of its predecessor, half-heartedly mimicking it. I wish I had just watched the first one again instead.",neutral,movie

78792,"Usually, the more I see a film the more I learn to appreciate it. Here's the opposite: I really enjoyed this when it came it at the theater. It made such an impression that I remember where exactly I saw this film, and I enjoyed it on TV a few other times afterward. Now, 40 years later my opinion of it is not the same. The only aspect that I still have a high regard for in here in the music, now considered probably one of the ""classic"" soundtracks.However, the three main characters - the men who dominate this film - played by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef - are really nothing but overly crude and excessively violent morons. The worst, of course, is Wallach's ""Taco."" He makes me want to take a shower after watching this film! He and Eastwood's ""Blondie"" just take turns brutalizing each other through much of the film. Van Cleef's role is considerably less, as ""Sentzenza"" or ""Angel Eyes.""Wallach's character is just plain insulting. He is a real lowlife and a horrible witness for anyone of the Catholic faith, which is why they probably emphasize the latter with him genuflecting throughout the film while acting like a complete degenerate. It's another slam on that denomination (of which I am not a member, by the way).I usually like Director Sergio Leone's long, dramatic, slow shots and good facial closeups Leone keeps his camera so long on one subject that it gets boring. So, there is a rarely a happy medium in this movie: it's either too violently stupid or too slow. What was once ""good"" has now turned ""bad"" and ""ugly.""",neutral,movie
78795,"Went to see this with my kids, 8, 6 and 4. They loved the superb animation, the great variety of colourful dragons and the breathtaking flying sequences and all the fireballs, but they only understood the story at its simplest level - i.e. a rather sweet story about a sensitive teenage boy called Hiccup, a weak, ""underdog"" Viking, who befriends a dragon against the wishes of his father.This film must come with two warnings (1) It is far below Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and other ""classic"" Dreamworks output. (2) Apart from the names of a few of the main characters, Hiccup's underdog rise, and the mythical location of the Viking island of Berk, the film bears little resemblance to the series of 8 brilliant Cressida Cowell books (which I highly recommend for readers aged 8-12).There is an attempt at humour, but it is quite weak, mainly because the supporting characters are all incredibly flat (and its a double shame because the Cressida Cowell books are hilarious). Hiccup, his father Stoick and the dragon, Toothless, are well portrayed, though. Also missing is the sort of modern pop soundtrack and pace that made Shrek stand out. Indeed, the film has a very slow start, largely because there are just too many device seeds to sow in order to make the all-action climax work. Although the climax is a brilliant visual spectacle, it all feels rather forced - the feeling I got was that they went through so much trouble to set up the climax, but it still didn't make sense. And to top it all Hiccup has an unnecessary love interest, Astrid. She is great as a Viking girl character, but there was no need to force the romance between her and Hiccup - it added nothing to the story except for schmaltz - something we'd expect from Disney rather than Dreamworks.Overall, this has to be one of the weakest scripts Dreamworks has produced. It will keep the kids entertained for a couple of hours and its probably even worth getting on DVD, but its most definitely not a classic.As a post script to the review, I'd also like to rant about all of the voice talents as well. Why does Hollywood think its okay to give Scottish accents to the adult Vikings? Do they not know that there is a difference between Vikings and Scots? And why, having given the adults Scottish accents, do they think that its okay for the teenagers (Hiccup, Astrid, etc) to have American accents? And if they're going to have American accents, why not have them voiced by teenagers, rather than by adults. Hiccup in particular I thought sounded far too much like the adult American that voiced him, nothing at all like a teenager, let alone a Viking one.",neutral,movie

Although, the film's twist ending, which I won't spoil here, was really good. I certainly didn't expect it.

It frequently flatters to deceive, with some gorgeous sets, captured well, and a sterling performance turned in by David Tennant who made wonders out of a truly pathetic role. Jodie Whittaker also deserves praise for a very emotive performanceThe problem though is that the whole thing is completely contrived, and it is painfully obvious to see. The story here would have made an OK film, maybe even a good one, but dragged out over 8 hours, half of it is simply spent in deliberate, undisguised misdirection, with a desperately weak conclusion that gave Lost a run for its money. Basically, the plot is at times non-sensical and frequently unrealistic. The cast do their best to deliver the story, but at the end of the day, they are polishing a turd. There's no doubt that at times the show moves you - and there is a hunger to find out ""who did it"" - but the result feels somewhat like a ruined orgasm.

79123,"THE NIGHT MANAGER seems to have a lot going for it - a big budget (enabling the action to be filmed in lots of exotic places such as Madrid, Mallorca and Morocco (standing in for Cairo), a good cast spearheaded by Hugh Laurie and current flavor of the month Tom Hiddleston, and a source-text by John le Carré, reminding us of those seminal adaptations of the late Seventies and early Eighties when Alec Guinness played George Smiley.With such in-built advantages, why does Susanne Bier's production prove such a disappointment? Partly the fault lies in the hackneyed plot-structure: THE NIGHT MANAGER takes the familiar us-versus-them scenario characteristic of Cold War spy thriller and transposes it to the contemporary era. This time the enemies are the terrorists threatening to destabilize the ""Middle East,"" who are being supplied with arms by dealer Richard Roper (Laurie). Bier's production is full of conventions characteristic of the genre: for example, sequences taking place in London where sharp-suited bureaucrats scowl at one another and talk in the kind of monosyllabic tones characteristic of those who don't want to reveal too many secrets. The action shifts rapidly between locations to suggest the extent of the plotting, while making us well aware that no one (except for the clean-cut hero, of course) can be trusted in the spying game.The only snag with this plot-structure is that not much actually happens, except for the cliff-hanger at the end of each episode. Bier spends considerable time using close-ups focusing on Laurie's inscrutable expressions as he coolly deals with his enemies, contrasted with Hiddleston's perpetually worried look as he tries to find a way out of the predicament of being embedded with the enemies.The production includes some familiar moments associated with so- called ""adult"" material. Hiddleston has numerous opportunities to get his kit off, as well as lasciviously eying the goods on offer when Laurie's girlfriend Jed Marshall (Elizabeth Debicki) goes skinny-dipping in the sea. The performances are eclectic, to say the least. Tom Hollander's Corcoran is, quite simply, frightful; a diminutive ex-army type given to making wry comments that only serve to emphasize his lack of presence. Olivia Colman, her northern accent as intermittent as her on screen appearances, does what she can with a thankless role as the hero's boss. Laurie is all smooth smarmy charm as the bad guy, the kind of person bestowing largesse on his friends while having his enemies liquidated at the earliest possible opportunity. Hiddleston does not have much to do, but appears particularly unconvincing in his role as the eponymous night manager of two luxury hotels. He spends so much time chasing after a pretty girl (Aure Atika) that we wonder whether he has any time to devote to his professional duties.Despite the resources lavished upon it, THE NIGHT MANAGER has to go down as a minor contribution to the Le Carré canon of adaptations.",neutral,movie

The problems of pacing were very much a worry for sound productions in the early 1930s; new techniques of exposition and editing had to be acquired, and the learning process was often slow and painful.

79209,"Director-Writer Neeraj Pandey's first two films 'A Wednesday' and 'Special Chabbis' were a absolute treat considering standards of Bollywood. Both were stunningly thrilling edge-of-seat experiences. Also both had believably good script even if some minor flaws could be caught here and there. With 'Baby' he continues with similar direction and writing style, sadly the screenplay here is very hollow. Plus having a abominated run time of 160 minutes where nothing new or surprising happens, it really drains the thrill part. Still Baby is watchable compared to other mundane Bollywood movies coming out these days, it definitely will click with the general Bollywood audience.'Baby' is the name of an elite Indian anti-terrorist squad established after the attacks of the 26/11. It has been named so because of its temporary and infant status. It's Headed by Feroz (Danny Denzongpa) with help of Ajay (Akshay Kumar), who is professionally skilled in espionage. Most of their job involves carrying out surgical ops to crack terror related intel around the globe. The first-half establishes this plot in a very boring fashion. Team Baby learn about plans for major terrorist attacks across India. At the same time terrorist Bilal (Kay Kay Menon) escapes from prison. Most of the story involves tracking down different people having information about his location. While all these missions have considerable amount of tension built- up but are void enough substance to back them up. Characters just pop- up without much development and then suddenly are gone. The vastly inferior screen time of Tapsee, Dagubbati and Anupam Kher was ridiculous. Their characters had some great potential in the script, unfortunately it is not utilized at all. Akshay Kumar does the required threshold but nothing special. Both his looks and acting were almost similar to the one in Special 26. The script is stuffed to many characters and throws very little light over them except Ajay. If you dig deeper there are many small goofs, especially during the ops. Situations and things turn up just to facilitate the easy and simple narration. The pacing and thrills pick up towards the end though with a not so surprising climax.The problem with Baby is not its premise but its execution. Everything is just kept plain and simple even if the situation demanded more depth to it. Most of the story is quite predictable expect for one or two small twists. On the positive side, it isn't filled with unnecessary songs and romance to ruin the atmosphere. The background-music was good but felt repetitive and forced. The first-half felt poorly edited. The plot advances very little in the first hour. If it wasn't for an engaging and edge-of-the seat last act, Baby would have been a very average film. The third act was the savior I would say. Baby is an ambitious attempt by Neeraj Pandey but lacks a good script. It is highly engaging at times, but feels very bland when the team is not on missions. Those who crave for thrill-elements without any care for other aspect will like it but for me it was quite average and disappointing considering the other works of Neeraj Pandey. But surely it is the first watchable film of 2015 without any doubt.RATING:[2.5/5]",neutral,movie

The rest of the plot is nonsense filler about the characters and their history, including a totally implausible ""we knew each other as kids"" back-story, and a ""revelation"" which I want so badly to shout about because it is so stupid, but don't want to 'spoil' for anyone out there who can't work it out from the heavy-handed hints throughout the short series.One of my major issues with this anime is the liberal use of nudity. Worse, child nudity. Warning: this series contains many, many shots of 13 year old girls in the buff. In fact, it shows just about as graphic scenes of child porn as is (for some reason) allowed by the censors. We're talking full groin shots on all fours.What's more messed up is that that is the most sexual of all the nudity in the series. Every episode (and the entirety of the opening and closing credits) bulges with breast and groin shots, but they are so badly drawn as to not have any effect on anyone over 12. However, when the young-guns come out, the poses and situations get more and more perverse. I know 13 is technically the age of consent in Japan, but come on.Towards the end the series is plagued by bawling sentimentalism. It manages to convey at least some feeling, and does feel like it picks itself up a little. But it is ultimately too little, too late. It was interesting, however, and the only time when you are actually asked to consider the characters as the children they are instead of just hard-ass emotional wrecks.Animation 6/10.Considering the hype there always was around this series, it is strange to see how low the animation quality is. The frame-rate is not good at all, the designs are sloppy, and the locations are severely limited/similar (though often nicely detailed).Characters 5/10.Tired stereotypes by the bundle. Huge, plump eyes even grace the male lead; bad hairstyles in stupid colours too. All very nice and cute, and clearly intended to be in juxtaposition with the bloody violence. However, rather than working to make it all the more powerful, it just looks wrong. It doesn't work. The violence is more like a sexual perversion in this setting.And just when you thought all the characters were present and accounted for, there's the guy with the spiky black hair and the very reflective glasses. Oh, and what's he doing? He's pushing those glasses up his nose with his middle finger while giving the camera a slightly sideways smirk. I promised that I would kill a man if I watched another anime featuring him, but when it comes down to it all I want to do is kill myself.The harem is an often-referenced bad point of the show, and I won't disagree. And as if two sworn enemies would live together. One has her arms and legs cut off by the other, then agrees to live with her. Whatever. The harem-hotel is where the series abandon's all sense of seriousness and becomes more like a gory Tenchi Muyo.I guess the main theme is stigma, but I'm confused. The pathetic ""nyuuu"" chick is apparently some kind of anti-hero. It seems like we are supposed to feel sympathy for this girl who indiscriminately kills people. The cast seems to manage it. At one point a very young ""Nyu"" gets bullied, so she kills all the kids bullying her (otaku revenge anyone?) and then goes on a rampage killing families. There is little about that that says ""victim"". Certainly nothing balances how damn annoying she is in every scene. I suppose we should believe that she cannot control her power, but without something likable is it almost impossible to feel any balance. Also, why the hell don't the girls in the series kill each other? They have an inexplicable tendency to push each other about and/or give each other a slap. You want them dead, so use your silly arms and kill them!Overall 5/10.Some anime forces you to look beyond the stereotypes and tired themes for the real story. I tried that with Elfen Lied and all I got was this lousy review.",neutral,movie
79494,"Better of Ted is a slightly more intelligent comedy show. Don't worry, it's quite accessible if you're too tired to think. At the same time you're not treated like an idiot. It's about the wacky little adventures and mannerisms in a department of a high tech company.The jokes aren't entirely one dimensional and are good enough to give you a few good chuckles per episode. I like the characters, two nerdy scientists, a manager, an office worker and even a higher manager, which is the awesome looking Portia de Rossi with her ""power hair"" to accentuate her cold heart. Those are the main characters.It quickly becomes apparent that sex and sexual tension will be a big deal throughout the season, though the first season didn't push it to the limits. Season two however goes over the top. It became annoying fast, and besides that, the jokes were far less amusing. To me it was clear the writers were out of ideas.The first season started off problematic in a different area: the first three to five episodes were loaded with Jewish and pro-gay references for no other reason than that a big part of the production is Jewish (and probably gay too). But somewhere as of the fifth episode or so, this annoyance was drastically reduced and often even absent. So I figure somebody intervened at some point, noticing it went out of hand.Clever series are most welcome and this one was well on its way to be just that. But then it lost its momentum entirely. That's the main reason I couldn't rate this title beyond five stars. The second season wasn't going in any direction - it was merely dragging it out with more sex and relationship ""jokes"".",neutral,movie

79787,"Not much. BUT, for a low (low, low, low) budget ""beach party"" film (set in Florida, for a change) there are *just* enough special moments to satisfy the truly curious. Those moments are all found in the musical numbers: Frank E Leonard croons to his long-lost love, cosmetics mogul Phyllis Diller, an amusing ""love"" song regarding Diller's supposed ugliness in ""You Haven't Changed a Bit""....with lines like ""the paper said that Peeping Tom was pulling down your shade.."" Ironic, as Phyllis Diller looks quite good here. Jayne Mansfield portrays a chubby daddy's girl/bush pilot who is sent by her father (Brian Donlevy) to see what 'those kids' are up to, and in doing so meets up with her beloved (Frank E Leonard, in a second role). Jayne gets to sing one song, the charming ""I'd Like To Be a Rose in Your Garden (But I'm Just a Thorn in Your Side)."" In real life, Jayne is obviously pregnant (with her youngest child); in some scenes there was no attempt to conceal her growing belly. Maybe the intention was for her character to be plump? Other numbers include cast member Lauree Berger (a very appealing short-haired brunette who could easily have given Annette Funicello a run for her money) singing the weirdly upbeat but submissive ditty ""You Put Me Down the Nicest Way You Can."" Jordan Christopher and the Wild Ones appear as ""the boys"" and perform ""The Turtle"", a slow-moving dance -which is like nothing you'll ever see in the big-budget ""beach"" movies. However, none of these musical moments belong in the same film with the Jordan Christopher-Lauree Berger duet ""Nanette"", a dreamily beautiful melody that could have been a hit if it wasn't lost in this film. ""The Fat Spy"" succeeds in a few fragments -if not as a whole- and for that its worth a look.",neutral,movie
79837,"I kind of enjoyed the leisurely pace of the movie; it was sort of a nostalgic flashback to a time when movies moved slowly enough for me to absorb all elements in a scene, instead of flashing through at such a breakneck speed that much information is lost. It was a dopey movie with mostly inept acting and a dopey premise (the aliens' speeches at the end sounded like any given night on George Noory), but it wasn't totally a waste of time. The music was pleasant; the whole movie had a kind of amateurish charm to it. I wouldn't ever watch it again, but I don't regret the time I spent on it. I have sat through far worse.

79870,"I didn't really know what I was getting myself into here when I picked up ""Deep Gold"" and decided to give it a view. I had somewhat expected it to be a treasure hunting movie of sorts.Which it was, in a way...""Deep Gold"" was entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, which was a semi-low budget action thriller. Mind you, there are far, far better movies in the genre out there. I managed to sit through ""Deep Gold"" to the end, and it should be said that the movie wasn't actually boring. But on the other hand, it wasn't a masterpiece either.The movie was shot in the Philippines, but somehow it eluded me why they spoke English and not Tagalog, the main dialect of the Philippines, or Cebuano, the local dialect spoken in the Cebu area where the movie was taking place. To reach out to a wider audience perhaps, I can only speculate. However, it felt forced and the movie seemed to lose some of its authenticity by having the Filipino and Filipina performers speak English.While ""Deep Gold"" hardly was a memorable movie, and one that I am sure will be obliterated from my memory in less than 48 hours, then it was still an enjoyable enough movie if you enjoy B-movies - which I happen to do. Then again, I am all for giving every movie a chance.Bebe Pham, playing Amy Sanchez, carried the movie quite well almost singlehandedly. So that was quite an accomplishment and testament to her acting talent and performance.""Deep Gold"" is, however, not the type of movie that will make it around for a second viewing, because the movie just didn't have that much appeal or that much of a plot and storyline to support more than a single viewing.I am rating ""Deep Gold"" five out of ten stars.",neutral,movie
79883,"I found this DVD in the dollar store bin and have to say it was easily worth the $1 (plus tax.) Conan spawned a lot of these muscle man-with-a-sword flicks and this one featured 4 times Mr. Universe Michael O'Hearn. Unlike Arnold or Lou Ferrigno, whose steroid use left them bloated and musclebound, O'Hearn is all natural with a leaner, more ripped look giving his fighting scenes a lot more appeal. A good looking guy who can actually act, he's trapped in this low budget mishmash. Wisely though, they put him in almost every scene to make the most of his star quality. Some of the fight scenes are good and O'Hearn dispatches bad guys as easily with his bare hands as he does with a sword. He also has a couple of love scenes with some bare-breasted beauties which lets him display a lot more of his impressive physique. The plot is only an excuse for the martial arts action and that's where O'Hearn shines. His opponents are no-name local muscle (it appears to have been filmed in Russia judging from the names) but they only exist to give O'Hearn an opportunity to show off his lethal talents.

Jeff is one such unlucky composer, but he's in a good mood. He and his wife, Mary, are about to set off on a long-delayed honeymoon. That is, until the phone rings. It seems the diva slated to appear on the show wants a new song and wants it now. No honeymoon until new song is in the can! What's a young musician to do? In the face of this bad news, Jeff is up to smoking the better part of a carton of cigarettes but not much more. Luckily, Jeff's flamboyant guardian angel is loitering on the roof with a bag of nose candy, and Mary's got a fixation with telephones...Phones, and their place in the interior design of the 50's, are about as close as this short comes to having a point. While Jeff struggles with his new assignment, Mary wanders about the house, wishing for updates to her decor. Every upgrade includes a new phone, although I suspect a phone in the bathroom would be a little weird.This short is good, if pointless, fun. The songs are catchy, and Mary is quite fetching when she's done up in her evening wear. There's no reason given for why Jeff and Mary went a whole year with no honeymoon.

80047,"American builder (Skerritt) living in Australia, building a luxury hotel in the Blue Mountains teams up with Lloyds of London insurance investigator (Mason) after his half-built hotel is razed in an apparent bushfire. The hotel's co-owner and financier (Doleman) has insured the partially-built hotel at an inflated value fuelling suspicions that the blaze may have been deliberately lit.Typical of a lot of Australian thrillers made in the late seventies to late eighties, with a couple of international stars (Skerritt, Mason) parachuted in to give a local production some international clout. Mason is very good, as always, as the wily English gentleman whose nose for suspicion and eye for detail, belie his otherwise mild, elderly appearance. Skerritt is dependable and the supporting cast is home-grown talent of the era (notably Wendy Hughes who again loses her kit in the memorable surf scene).Plodding and at times lacking momentum, the suspense does eventually build to a tense climax and despite all the plot holes, is quite an entertaining conclusion. Memorable for probably three scenes (the surf encounter, derailment and the aforementioned climax), the film benefits from Mason's presence in particular, elevating the picture to ""average"" status, where the otherwise lacklustre direction and pacing conspired to drag it down. Not a great arson film, but has its moments.",neutral,movie

80121,"Since this is a story about a man who is a Dragon Hunter in a world of Orcs, Elves, and Dragons you would think this is a Fantasy. However, as a fantasy film, it pretty well sucks. The Dragon is only in the movie for a few minutes and the orcs you see are just a band of five, dispatched in seconds, and the special effects for them are quite weak, they're just men in masks. The Dragon, on the other hand, is a pretty decent CGI for a low budget flick from 2009.Realising the budget wouldn't be so large the writer and director, Stephen Shimek, decided to make it about the journey of brothers Darius and Kendrick, played strongly by Erik Denton and Maclain Nelson respectively, to get to the Castle Okarda to train the last Dragon Hunter. On the way, they form alliances with a band of soldiers who accompany them on their mission.As a drama, it's an above-average film with some really nice camera shots. I particularly liked the way Shimek created the love scene between Darius and the Elfin Raya, portrayed elegantly by Kelly Stables. There's a nice chemistry between the pair and as they move in for their first kiss a rain shower starts, and you know what the rain drop hitting the leaf really represents.The actors have above average acting skills and give the most to their roles.The only things that irked me were the amount of time the journey took; they walked a lot... and must have passed the same tree at least three times, this slowed the film down quite a bit... not to the point of boredom, but close. Then there was the swordplay when the Hunter was training. It would've been advisable to bring in an expert to show them how to wield a sword correctly.This is not a fast action-packed movie it's a slow meander through the fantasy realm and therefore not for everyone. I enjoyed it, though I wouldn't rush to watch it again... or ever.If there's nothing else to watch and you can't get out the house for some reason, then this could pass the time quite well.",neutral,movie
80224,"It was with some trepidation that I watched Clementine the other day, because I had heard nothing but a relentless stream of terrible things about it. I was surprised to see that it's a Korean film in every way, given Seagal's background in Japanese martial arts and the fact that he speaks fluent Japanese. But make no mistake, Clementine is not a Seagal movie, it's an action comedy that's heavy on the comedy (and cheap drama, for some reason) and light on the action. The only problem is that the comedy is spotty at best and Seagal's presence on the cover box serves only to make us wonder where he is for the whole movie.The story is about Kim, a fallen Korean Taekwon-do champion who leaves his country when a bad referee call costs him the championship title. He moves to Los Angeles and becomes a cop and never goes back to Korea, although he must live in Korea tow because he and he speaks nothing but Korean, as do his colleagues and his daughter. Having lost his fighting career, he decides to concentrate on a career in law enforcement and taking care of his daughter. A fight promoter is trying to get him back in the ring but Kim doesn't want to get back into fighting.Kim's daughter is impossibly cute and takes after her father. When Kim gets called in to talk to the principal because his daughter beat up some kid that was teasing her, Kim scowls at the kid and says, ""Well you got what you deserved, didn't you!"" Unfortunately, there is a stupid sub-plot involving the girl's mother that serves to do nothing but make a light- hearted, half-witted comedy pretty thoroughly depressing. The little girl who plays Kin's daughter has some great scenes, but it seems like she was just screaming and crying for about the last 30 minutes or so of the film. Oh and remember that huge black guy in Underworld? The one that did that weird thing where he's trying to make his voice so deep that it just calls attention to his crappy acting? That guy is in this movie, and he's still doing that stupid thing with his voice. Maybe someone forgot to tell him that he's not in a vampire movie anymore. But it's pretty much in tune with the rest of the awful acting in the movie, although Dong-jung Lee, who plays the main character, does have some pretty funny moments, especially in the first half of the film, which is the best part of the movie and I would argue that it's even pretty entertaining and fun.It's revealing about the rest of the movie that the formidable talent of Seagal himself is completely wasted. He has nothing to do in the entire movie except do what he does worst in all his other movies – show up at the end and make some goofy speech and then wander off screen in slow motion. Yawn. But this is not a Seagal movie, it's a Korean martial arts comedy where he makes a brief appearance at the end, in one of the film's only English scenes. If they had kept up the almost family comedy sitcom story of the first half of the movie it could have been fun, light-hearted fare, but trying to give us this dramatic social situation involving the little girl and her missing mother and the whole thing with Seagal just turned it into a muddled mess.",neutral,movie

80313,"2005's ""Clawed"" (aka ""The Unknown"") is not nearly as bad as some of these negative reviews here claim. No, it's not ""Apocalypse Now"" but it never pretends to be anything more than what it is -- a Grade-B made-for-TV Bigfoot flick.THE STORY: In Washington state three poachers get killed on a mountain by what is thought to be a killer grizzly. The sole survivor returns with three more rednecks to get revenge; meanwhile a group of high school teens also go up to the mountain for a senior project. Add to the mix a couple of rangers and a Sasquatch creature.WHAT WORKS:The Washington locations are great, filmed in Buckley and North Bend. - The villains here are the loathsome poachers; the rest of the cast are likable with the exception of the arrogant jock, who sort of redeems himself by the end. The lead redneck, by the way, is none other than Miles O'Keeffe who played the title role in 1981's infamous ""Tarzan, the Ape Man"" (beefcake hero to villainous hick, how about that?). - The two girls are quite fetching, especially the brunette (Chelsea Hobbs). One reviewer implies it's unlikely that the brunette would be attracted to Richard, the intelligent/woodsman type, but I didn't find it unlikely at all. Since when do pretty girls only find arrogant, obnoxious jocks attractive? (Arrogance shouldn't be confused with confidence). Richard is quiet, humble and skillful in his areas of expertise. The brunette obviously finds these traits attractive. Meekness isn't weakness, after all. - Although ""Abominable"" (2006) is an entertaining Bigfoot flick the creature in that film is nothing more than a monster of unadulterated horror (with a goofy face). I like the fact that ""Clawed"" portrays the creature in a more benevolent, almost noble fashion. Some reviewers have even gone so far as to describe him as the ""brown Hulk."" - Some Native American legends claim Sasquatch is a spirit-being that can come and go in the physical realm. This is touched on in the film. - Speaking of the creature, I thought they did a good job with the costume (He looks like he spends a lot of time in the gym). At least the creature doesn't have a goofy face a la ""Abominable."" - Speaking of goofy, there are thankfully no campy elements like ""Abominable."" Although there's some goofiness, this is essentially a serious Bigfoot flick accompanied by a serious dramatic soundtrack, not that everything's believable, of course. - I like the fact that the film only runs 80 minutes before credits. Films of this ilk shouldn't overstay their welcome.WHAT DOESN'T WORK:Although the film's not bad, it never arises above the level of decent. (You haven't seen bad, by the way, until you've seen 2008's ""Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon""). The set-up of the story is great but the final act fumbles the ball. It's like once they (the filmmakers) get the various groups up into the forest where the creature is lurking they don't know what to do from there. - I pointed out above that not everything's believable, which includes the poachers' antics. I also didn't buy the teens camping out on the mountain with a supposed killer grizzly on the loose (Wouldn't their parents object? Would the girls likely go, especially considering no one in their group had weapons?). - Most films like this HAVE to have one or more ultra-wise Native Americans who are ""at one"" with nature and all-knowing concerning the mythical creature at hand (e.g. ""Man-Thing,"" ""Prophecy,"" ""Orca,"" etc.). Get real.Some complain that they can't figure out certain plot points; read Willaim R. Hancock's Amazon review for an excellent explanation (from October 16, 2006).BOTTOM LINE: This is a decent modern Bigfoot flick that should please fans of the Sasquatch mythos. Although the set-up is great, it's hampered by a weak last act. It's better than ""Sasquatch"" (2002) but it's no where near as good as ""Sasquatch Mountain"" (2005). I like the fact that the legend is respected and the creature isn't made out to be a bloodthirsty ee-vil monster. Although there's a little gore, gorehounds who drooled over ""Abominable"" will not be appeased by ""Clawed;"" in other words, stay away if you're solely interested in a bloodstained slasher/monster flick.GRADE: C+",neutral,movie

80352,"I'm a big fan of the so-called horror/cult sub genre of ""Rednecksploitation"". This was another typically 70's cinema phenomenon, primarily popularized by the huge success of ""Deliverance"" and including some glorious titles like ""Poor Pretty Eddie"", ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", ""Two Thousand Maniacs!"" and ""Just Before Dawn"". These disturbingly demented movies are by definition set in small Southern American communities where the local (and usually inbred) population doesn't care too much about dental hygiene, copulate with barn animals, dance to hideous banjo music and  naturally  rape & kill all the civilized persons passing through their territory. Genuine ""Rednecksploitation"" movies like that simply cannot be made nowadays anymore, because they're filthy, discriminating, rough and extremely women-unfriendly. When coincidentally stumbling upon ""Small Town Folk"", I secretly hoped this would be the long-awaited return of hillbilly-horror, or at least a competent enough homage to the good old days. And this miniature British production surely had a lot of things going for it. The British as well have their very own cinematic Rednecksploitation classic (""Straw Dogs""), the film was entirely put together by a group of friends (which usually means fewer restrictions) and the cover promisingly depicts black-teethed & crazy-eyed posing with scythes and axes! Unfortunately the film isn't nearly as good as it looks, but still I can't bring myself at writing overly negative stuff. After all, there's a lot of obvious goodwill and ambition present in this, just the execution and eventual outcome is somewhat unsatisfying. For some reason, maybe to make the film more accessible for wider audiences, the digital filming style and narrative structure makes ""Small Town Folk"" look like a fantasy-tale as much as like a horror film. The fantasy and comedy aspects inevitably undercut the horror ideas and eventually the film becomes too silly to pass for a full-blooded horror film and yet too grim & bloody to pass for a fantasy flick to watch with the whole family. The story is standard, with a young couple driving their Jeep through isolated British landscapes and hopelessly getting lost. Two Knackermen  whatever the hell that may be  advise the couple to stay far away from a little place called Grockleton, but naturally that's exactly where they stop to spend the night. The hideous locals are very interested in Susan, since there's a severe shortage of women in Grockleton, but her hubby Rick fights back and he gets some welcome support from a teenage biker armed with a Polaroid camera and a helmet. The Grockleton hicks outwardly live up to the all known stereotypes, but unfortunately none of them gives a convincing performance. The main redneck characters (Landlord, Dobbin) all severely overact and lack something essentially petrifying. Actually, the only truly menacing-looking ones were those whose faces were covered and didn't talk much, like the scarecrow-brothers and the horseshoe-archer. There are some nice bits and pieces of gore, including a couple of sickle-killings, but ""Small Town Folk"" never fully feels like the brutal backwoods horror film it ought to have been. Warwick Davis of ""Willard""-fame and numerous ""Leprechaun"" movies makes a small appearance, but few of the stuff he says makes any sense and I seriously have no idea what a Knackerman does for a living. It's not a great film, but if Peter Stanley-Ward and his circle of pals decide to make more films, I won't hesitate to check them out.",neutral,movie

How and why those personalities change isn't very well established, though, nor is what exactly was happening or had happened that set the plot into motion. I suppose a grand answer to the question of ""What's going on?"" isn't necessary if you look at the film as a sort of chamber piece set within a larger story, but it's frustrating to be left in the dark. Nevertheless, in mood and atmosphere, ""Everywhen"" felt like a pretty good episode of ""Fringe"" or ""The X-Files.""Honestly, the worst thing about ""Everywhen"" were the gunfights between the protagonists and the police, including SWAT units, which were ridiculously one-sided. Those felt like childish male fantasies, straight out of video games these days, or one-sided games of cops and robbers back in the day.",neutral,movie

Im a huge Danielle Harris and Tiffany Shepis fan, so i was excited to check this out, even though i saw this movie was distributed by Barnholtz entertainment. The plot was pretty easy to follow, a group of friends get invited to a small towns annual Halloween haunted country theme park. These friends years before were involved in a cruel prank that leaves a young girl severely injured and hal of her face disfigured. Now as a teen, she helps her family operate the haunted house attractions. As the night goes on, the responsible teens begin to be killed off. This revenge slasher is one of those where the killer is unmasked in the end. I found it pretty cool that people touring the attractions was convinced some the bodies were fake, when they were actually being killed. Not much of a twist to the killers identity though. And the kills were pretty graphic. Good set design also. This movie was fun, its worth at least a watch.",neutral,movie

Right: actors incapable of acting, incredibly dumb dialogue and a whole lot of joyful nudity (and downright disgusting sex scenes with totally unattractive guys and girls). Which I regard as absolutely worthwhile and entertaining - but that's just my personal opinion. The story? Story?? oh, well, it's kind of a remake of TARZAN, plus some adventure- and cannibal-stuff. But basically it's about seeing Katja Bienert nude, and it works when it comes down to that. Just realize: she was about 15 or 16 when this film was made, and she was really not very shy. Anyway: go get this one if you're able to find it, but be prepared to feel the urge to throw it in the garbage can once you've seen it. P.S.: This film has been re-issued in 1999 by the german label X-RATED CULT MOVIES, but with a different title: MONDO CANNIBALE 4. Obviously for marketing-reasons. Cause you'd better not expect to watch one of the infamous Euro-Cannibal-flics when you put this in. Franco has done better than this. Katja Bienert has, too.

81226,"This movie should have been called ""NIGHT OF THE SLOPE WALKER.""  Mack Hail plays the SLOPE WALKER, and he is good at walking at a slope!  Nobody walks at a slope like Mack Hail.  If you notice when you watch this movie, Mack Hail is walking at a slope and that adds to the creepiness of his character. I really liked his friend, the spider.  The Slope Walker confides all his secrets to the spider.  That spider was a good actor!  I liked the way he laid out his silk while the Slope Walker told him secrets.  I have a friend who tells all his secrets to his pet cat, Charlie.  He even has a picture of himself whispering in to Charlie's ear, and he put a little cartoon dialogue bubble with words in it.The Slope Walker is nice to the spider, who survives the whole movie. But he is not nice to other people and to grass!  He kills lots of people and when he gets mad, he throws himself on the ground and tears out the grass. That's pretty scary, to think somebody is walking around here in Vegas at a sloped angle and killing people.  Now, when I walk around on the strip and everything, I always keep my eye out for whoever is not walking straight up and down.  If people are walking tilted over at an angle, I am careful to avoid them.  If they are crazy, I will avoid them like crazy!  I don't want to get ""sloped,"" if you know what I mean.Slope for slope, this movie delivered the goods!  I hope they make a sequal to this movie.  They could call it, ""THE SLOPES OF FIRE.""  Or maybe, they could combine Mack Hail's character with something like the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and call it, ""SLOPAZOIDS FROM THE DEEP.""  And if they could get Vin Diesel to co-star in it with Mack, they could call it, ""THE SLOPEAROUND GUYS.""  That would be cool!  Vin Diesel could walk at a slope! Or, they could put a sci-fi edge to the movie and call it, ""THE SLOPE FROM OUTERSPACE.""  This movie concept has so many possibilities!

Basically a family on the brink of losing their house in the middle of the outback is suddenly under siege by a ""pack"" of attack dogs. Yes, it does sound somewhat stupid by that but taking a simplistic idea and doing something with it (without cheating and using a 200 million dollar budget) is something to be said. The acting is good and seems very matter of fact. The characters just had believable qualities that helped the story along. The pace was done well and of course turns into high gear when the animals go into full attack mode. Speaking of, the effects were fine and not overdone are bad cgi laden.

The girl's motivations are never explained, but her crazy face almost sells the idea that if you're left in the woods alone, stripped of your clothes, wandering through the beautiful vistas, you just might go on a spree of all things irrational. One thing that's good about the film is music - it is better than what you'll witness on screen. The makes of this movie probably are aware of that too, since the music almost never stops.

But I have to say it got buried under poor writing, unimaginative cinematography, and a heavy-handed approach to film-making and storytelling.Leto performed well, given the fact they handed him an impossible character. One which is supposed to connect with the audience on an emotional level, while also being a detached psychopathic killer. Believe it or not, there is a way to do this engagingly and 'correctly'. Leon the Professional comes to mind. They didn't do that here.The overly-long transition scenes were a poor attempt at pacing. The acting rarely managed to deliver the goods, and the ending was trite and unimpressive. However, they clearly splurged on the scoring which was a welcome surprise. It's a Japanese lovefest all the way around, giving us all the the things traditionally associated with the country. But while I appreciate paying homage to an incredibly unique and beautiful culture, I don't think staining it with the horrific crimes of a small subset of the population was entirely appropriate.Bottom line?

81960,"When taken in the right spirit, this is a pretty enjoyable film, but it has its share of problems nonetheless. Sold as a parody of the way Hollywood tends to treat actual historical events, it doesn't really live up to its promises as it only occasionally does a decent job of lampooning its subject matter. When it does, it's very funny - my favourite exchange being (paraphrased) ""It's up to the Americans to save the day again!"", ""God, I wish I was an American!"". The rest of the time, though, it seems content to simply be a wacky slapstick comedy that gets its laughs from making prominent historical figures look a little ridiculous. Sometimes this works - I adored Neve Campbell's performance as Elizabeth, as well as her hilariously overdone accent... in fact she's probably the best part of the movie - but other times it doesn't, for example with Goering and Goebbels. It also has a habit of making its jokes too obvious at times, as if writer/director Peter Richardson was afraid that audiences wouldn't get it: it's not enough for Churchill's fellow GI, an African-American, to be relegated to the role of the stereotypical black comic relief character, he actually has to point this out to us.Nonetheless, it's a fun movie, although I suspect that it will go down better with British audiences than American viewers. Provided you're not expecting sophisticated comedy or subtlety of any kind I expect you'll have fun. 7/10",neutral,movie

The dialog is cross and direct from a bad self-help book; however, is said with some dignity and Austin shows he is not only a killing machine, he has potential to not embarrass himself in more meaty roles.A nice time waster, if you do not have anything else to do and likes to tackle this kind of movie.",neutral,movie

Well because it is confusing, has more to offer, quite a dark tension, the only thing that killed it for me, was the plot. In the end, you'll get to see what this is about, a subject used 1000 times at least!Thus, I approve to the execution, the style, acting, it has a lot of things you've seen before, many familiar horror scenes, but they did make the most of them and about 80% of the movie, everything is a blur. It keeps you guessing and has a lot to offer for such a little production. Once the end approaches, you kinda anticipate where it is heading and it really feels like a tired old formula, but, you did get so far, so most likely you'll find the strength to watch it till the credits. Anyway, it is a good movie, I enjoyed it, far better than most, overall, a cute little indie production.For a ""in the woods"" horror, I think Lemon Tree Passage is definitely a ""try it once"" movie, because it is a nice add-on to such productions and it would be a shame to let it pass unnoticed. Quite glad I got my eyes on it, don't expect a master piece, but surely some good ol' fun.Lemon Tree Passage has a lot of the old, in a new mix, that manages to offer 90 minutes of good time!

Wow, such great premise, how the hell did they miss the mark? The director is to blame here. It was so so lame and boring. The actors did a good job, though i would have to say that sometimes the reaction factor is kind of weak.

I can't say too much about the audio though, because the German DVD had the Russian language in Stereo!! Some might say, I should be happy that they included the original audio ... and subtitles (which are MIA when it comes to the deleted scenes on the disc here!!).The movie has lesser action that I had thought it would have. It has interesting (if flawed and clichéd) characters, that could have had more screen time or nicer setups. The action scenes (sparely used as I said) are nicely shot and as you can read here too, are inspired by Gan Kata (see Equilibrium for that). Especially one scene with pistols/guns (I'm not an expert, so I can't say what weapon manufacturer they are from) ...One of the main problems is, that the movie tries to over-complicate a few things (relationships) and sadly does not succeed with it.

This film does a great job of evoking that same feeling, with a decent script and a pretty decent SFX budget. The acting, however, was beyond hacky, and really marred the integrity of the film. Almost everyone involved in this movie was just awful, with overacting and poor delivery abundant in every scene. It was like watching a student film at times, with people who have no business being in front of a camera. With a more talented cast, this would have been a worthy addition to 80's horror films.

Also typical stuff like the characters are bland and not interesting and I'm not a huge fan of this kind of story. It's not a ""story"" it's a situation, and to me that's kinda lame-ish. I mean, some effort on putting a story. The Descent could have been a ""situation"" movie, but instead, the writer actually wrote a story with real characters. BTW, The Descent was pretty good IMO. Anyway, that's my only real problem though... The actors did a decent job, not amazing but were likable, if a bit boring at times. Still, they had some good lines and funny moments were believable enough. Also I love that there is no real villain in the movie. I mean the wolfs, I guess are the villains, but that would be stretching the idea of a villain. They are stuck, simply as that. They'r not fighting anybody, except them freezing to death. It's kinda refreshing. And the ending is kinda satisfying. And the characters are kinda likable, so you will root for them. Also what I like about is how grounded on reality it is. Again, this is a situation you could be in. And the script tries to be as realistic as possibly, but fails at times. It has to throw something interesting on the screen, but we all know that if you were in that position, you would just stay in there. Don't act like you wouldn't!Anyway, it's a decent flick.

Lots of women bare their breasts in this film, and they all get strangled for it. The disturbed killer is a Vietnam veteran (how original) with severe mommy & daddy issues (even more original) and scarily portrayed by Nicolas Worth (the guy honestly comes across as cunning, unpredictable and plain nuts). Worth has developed a bit of a cult status as an actor himself, having starred in a couple of early Wes Craven films and even Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"" (1990). The title of ""Don't Answer The Phone"" is a bit of a head-scratcher, as hardly any phone rings in this film. There's a psychiatrist lady who has a radio show, and at one point Killer Worth calls her up and strangles a woman, live on the air. Perhaps that explains the movie title to some extend. In the end, ""Don't Answer The Phone"" is glorious trash, both demented & ridiculous. And well, you may add misogynistic to that as well. While watching it, I experienced flashbacks to other films widely ranging from Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) over William Lustig's ""Maniac"" (1980) to Abel Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant"" (1992). But ""Don't Answer The Phone"" by far can't compete with any of those. It's not exactly a good film, but it manages to keep the attention of the viewer. Aside from the naked women, the strangulations and Worth acting all crazy, there's an amusing homicide cop-duo very determined to capture this maniac. Their adventures alone, are worth it already. And some of the dialogue is grin-inducing (and I'm not even talking about what all Worth gets to utter). At one point the cops are looking for clues out on the streets. Upon interrogating a bum who might know something, one cop sarcastically answers: ""The last time this guy gave us a tip, he told us that the Boston Strangler was Tony Curtis."". Way to go script writer! If you don't get this joke right away, then go to the movie page of ""The Boston Strangler"" (1968) and check out the cast.It's for little things like this that ""Don't Answer The Phone"" gains points all over the place. Just wait for that scene where the cop-duo enters a brothel to look for a suspect. In one room there's a coke-deal going on and the criminals get alerted in time. Panic ensues, cocaine starts flying all across the room and one bimbo who wants to get rid of the evidence doesn't know any better than to start snorting the whole amount of spilled coke on the desk. Then when the cops enter and catch her snorting, she goes ""Wooowie!"" with a big smile on her face while lashing out with a whip. Not much later, the two cops shoot the suspect. Both of them shoot numerous time. He's dead, so one cop sighs while saying something along the lines of ""Now we're gonna be stuck all night doing paper work on this one"". The other cop goes: ""What do you mean, 'we'? I missed."" I had no idea total exploitation trash could be this funny. Either way, it makes ""Don't Answer The Phone"" very much worth a watch.",neutral,movie

So I was expecting an over-the-top gory slasher with lots of body count but what I got is a routine slasher who has some decent moments but fails in delivering the goods in terms of bloodshed except for one or two enjoyable splatter sequences.

The entire movie is one big special effects reel, without a coherent story or much of a story, in fact, to string it together. Things take place in the film's 80-minutes that have no rhyme or logic to them. They're all in service of the next special effects scene that will, usually, showcase a CGI aircraft of one sort or another. The entire film, actually, should just be a bunch of CGI tanks and CGI helicopters flying around shooting at each other. Which is a shame, because the acting is actually quite good. Unfortunately the script is nonexistent and you've seen better versions of this in the INDIANA JONES movies and ROMANCING THE STONE.Mindless CGI is nice to look at.

83162,"Joseph Hahn is best known as a musician with the band Linkin Park, and after directing a ton of music videos, he decided to give movies a shot. His first film, Mall, is kind of like a car wreck on the side of the road, in that it's horrible, but for some reason you can't look away. It's a seemingly normal day at a normal mall, and five friends are just hanging out, looking for something to do. Everything is pretty normal until a strung out shooter opens fire, but instead of fleeing, the teens decide to hang out and interact with people caught in the aftermath. This is one really strange movie, and as I said earlier, it's pretty bad, but for some reason I couldn't tear myself away from it. Shameless's Cameron Monaghan stars and was really fun to watch. I've always been a fan of his work and find his character, Ian, to be the most interesting one on Shameless. Mall is a different role and different character, but Monaghan is still able to bring that same charisma to the role and made this film somewhat more enjoyable for me. He really has a gift, at the turn of a switch this kid can go from sweet, to sexy, to evil, thanks to a very unique talent and you heard it hear first, this kid is going places. That being said, I tend to think he would be wise to leave this film off his demo reel, as it is just super strange and anti-climatic. Once you start watching Mall, you won't be able to stop. You'll see a great performance by Cameron Monaghan, while you sit and wait for any number of things to happen, that never do, making the film Mall just another confusing, artistic, independent film, that is really only fully understood by the person who wrote it.",neutral,movie

83249,"There must be a shortage of capable men, that's why women now seem to be the ones taking over in saving the world (if not doing something that only men usually do). Well, at least, that's how it looks in movies. We've seen Katniss Everdeen and Tris Prior lead powerful rebellions against their respective ironfisted governments, Clary Fray battle demons and supernaturals, and Jupiter Jones get crowned as the cosmic queen. I mean, from becoming mere sexual objects for playboy billionaires, they've gone as far as being the supreme leader of the universe, what else can these women do just so they could equate themselves with men? What about as an international assassin?In Barely Lethal, 16 year-old Megan Walsh (not her real name) is a trained international assassin. This premise already engages interest and holds so much potential, but it fails to deliver a satisfying result. The problem begins when Megan leaves the academy where little girls are trained to become assassins. She fakes her death and enrolls herself in a suburban highschool, hoping everything is going to be normal. Only it turns out it isn't as easy as it seems. From here, the trajectory of the narrative disappoints immensely. It begins undermining the capacity of its lead character by dismissing the fact that she is a trained killer, exposing her vulnerabilities and teenage dramas, instead. This isn't a totally a insane idea, she's 16-year old, after all. But getting further dragged by bland one liners and intertwining subplots, makes it even worse. Eventually, in the wake of its competing concerns, it loses grip of its own direction and struggles to arrive to a decent endpoint. It also doesn't succeed tapping the utmost otential of its strong supports by not giving them enough material to work with. Jessica Alba and Samuel Jackson barely do something here, though there may be some little moments with their presence, that aren't really devoid of wit. Almost everything just falls flat, and the comic effort couldn't provide any aid, either, to redeem its sagging narrative.By the time the movie is already fast approaching its finale, it isn't any more surprise if Megan never came close to any of those heroines mentioned earlier, and it really disappoints that she never really came to be someone interesting, either. Well, you may want to blame that to her unconvincing chemistry (not saying there's any) with both her love interests, and a boring villain whose presence may have only really felt during the last action sequence of the movie.BARELY LETHAL wastes almost every promising attribute it has to live up to its overwhelming potential. In the end, it abandons what could be a unique take on the young espionage genre, and sets itself taking the leads of countless others it seems to emulate.

83290,"'THE QUIET ONES': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Routine supernatural horror flick released by Hammer Film Productions and directed by John Pogue. Pogue has previously written B movies like 'THE SKULLS' and 'U.S. MARSHALLS' and he also co-wrote and directed the zombie sequel 'QUARANTINE 2: TERMINAL'. He co-wrote this film with Craig Rosenberg and Oren Moverman (it's based on a screenplay by Tom de Ville). The flick stars Jared Harris, Sam Claflin (of 'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE', 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES' and 'SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN' fame), Olivia Cooke, Erin Richards and Rory Fleck-Byrne. It does have a few good scares, and some decent creepy atmosphere, but it's mostly just a bore.Harris plays Joseph Coupland; a professor at the University of Oxford, in the 1970s, who's determined to prove that the supernatural don't exist. He believes that the mentally ill produce ghosts, and other manifestations, from negative energy and if we can find a cure for their illness we can also rid the world of it's 'supernatural' problem. Coupland has two assistants, Krissi (Richards) and Harry (Fleck-Byrne), who help him with his experiments. They're currently studying a former abandoned orphan, named Jane Harper (Cooke), who appears to be possessed. A student named Brian McNeil (Claflin) wants to join their study, as a cameraman documenting their work, after hearing one of Coupland's lectures. He quickly develops feelings for Jane, when he does, and begins to question Coupland's treatment of her.The film goes through all the usual motions (that all of these type of flicks do), and it doesn't do a horrible job, but we've definitely seen it all before. The acting and directing are OK but, like I said, the movie is just way too dull. The mood and scary images are good but the frights are just too 'few and far between'.

Yes the inciting incident is as stupid as it gets (especially considering the lawyer position). The movie tries to make up for that, by showing the past of our main character, which sort of is trying to make the decision relating to the viewer.Of course Samuel L. Jackson does not care, what the character is or if some would consider the script weak. His performance is top notch once again. Just him picking up a glass of water and sipping from it, is a delight to watch (especially considering the circumstances of that scene and how it came to be).

Zombies rise from the graveyard and remarkably manage to eat the brains of everyone except for the few people within which the movie revolves around. The two movies are pretty much similar in terms of content, but what is lacking this time around is freshness.The first movie took a satirical approach to George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead', and it worked in terms of humor and creepy fun. In this film, which is basically a carbon copy of the first, it is not quite as much fun. Rather, it seems to be more silly than funny.  The script strains for humor throughout the movie, particularly in a scene in which the movie mocks Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video.

83485,"""The wolves... if they're not already at your door... they're gonna be there very efin soon.""Lost River has the potential of becoming a cult film in a few years because it is very artistic and far from being a mainstream movie due to its lack of a cohesive narrative structure and its nightmarish atmospheric approach. Ryan Gosling, who is one of my favorite actors, is the writer and director of Lost River, and for a first feature film I must say that he aimed extremely high. He borrows heavily from directors he's worked with in the past or that he's admired, so you can see some heavy influences from Refn, Noe, Cronenberg, and perhaps even more from David Lynch. These aren't directors that are easy to imitate and therefor Gosling struggles to find his own voice although the result is rather unique. Being an actor that many people like the easiest thing for Gosling would've been to direct a mainstream film, but I give him credit for trying to make an artistic film that will be appreciated by a select group of people. I didn't have any funny watching Lost River, but I did find some of the nightmarish scenes quite disturbing so it isn't one of those movies you easily forget about. I'm not a fan of surrealism so I'm not the greatest judge for a film like this, but I think that it will find its audience with fans of movies like Enter the Void, Under the Skin or any of Lynch's films. What Rosling is trying to get at under all the heavy imagery he uses is the desolation that the American Dream has on some people when its not achieved.Perhaps the most difficult thing to do in a review for a film like this is write a plot summary because it would be easy to confuse the reader and make them believe there is some sort of narrative structure to the movie when in reality it's more about setting a dreamy atmosphere. The story takes place in a fictional town named Lost River where most of the people have abandoned the place after a nearby flood destroyed the city. It is actually filmed in an abandoned town in Detroit and Gosling experiments by having some residents interact with the actors in a couple of scenes. A young teen named Bones (Iain De Caestecker) dreams of leaving the city knowing there is no future there, but his single mother, Billy (Christina Hendricks), refuses to leave the place where she grew up in. Billy is behind on the payments of her home however, and she is forced by a banker named Dave (Ben Mendelsohn) to accept a job at this sort of dark underground freak show that he owns. Bones' neighbor, Rat (Saoirse Ronan), who lives with her mute widowed grandmother, tells him that the flood has left a spell on the town and that is why everyone behaves so strange in this city. The streets are owned by a violent man known as Bully (Matt Smith) who Bones gets into trouble with. Meanwhile Billy is introduced to the dark underworld where she works where audiences seem to have a fascination for gore. There she meets one of the performers, Cat (Eva Mendes) who shows her how the place works. The film basically follows these characters and introduces us to the nightmarish town accompanied with a vibrant electric score and neon lights. The performances in Lost River are solid with Ben Mendelsohn standing out as you can tell he's having a lot of fun with his character. The film might be all over the place at times, but the talented cast delivers. Iain de Caestecker is the lead actor and his scenes were probably my favorite when it focused on his relationship with Rat and the tension between his character and Bully. Matt Smith is also having a lot of fun with his character and despite not being as menacing a villain his wacky and violent behavior is always hard to predict. As much as I enjoyed Christina Hendricks in the female lead role, the scenes of the dark underworld took me completely out of the movie. It was a freak show that I didn't care for very much. Reda Kateb has some interesting scenes playing the nice cab driver. There is one scene where he talks to Billy about the American dream which is sort of the underlying message of the film. Overall I felt the movie didn't balance the two main stories very well and there were scenes that felt disconnected with the rest of the film. Lost River isn't an easy watch but I still admire Gosling's effort.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",neutral,movie

A film that at least tries to put together some sort of a story (even if it is a bit lacking) or films that have none or are just earlier versions of Fast & The Furious? I know what I'd rather go with.Pay The Ghost isn't that fantastic, and I'm not suggesting that it is, but for all the complaints it has received, it's altogether not THAT bad. I mean granted the story has been done a thousand times before and it's loaded with clichés (hard to find movies that don't have clichés to be honest), but this film never sets out to be a fantastic Oscar winning epic. It's a middle-of-the-road Horror film, and you get pretty much exactly what you pay for here. Nothing about the story kept me on the edge of my seat, but nothing about it wanted me to slit my wrists for something better to do either. There were a few decent moments scattered throughout, but it wasn't really all that scary.Some people moan about him but for the most part I enjoy watching Nicolas Cage. Is he over-the-top in some films? Yes, but generally he's a pretty solid actor. You tend to kind of know what you'll get with Cage. His performance in Pay The Ghost isn't anything to write home about but I think with this type of film & story if he put any more into it, then it would have been too much. I don't generally mind Sarah Wayne Callies', but the characters she plays do tend to rub me the wrong way. Her character in The Walking Dead was like that and her character here did the same.I'd say to give this film a shot if you like Nicolas Cage films or if there's nothing else better for you to watch, but other than that it's a bit of a watch it and forget it type of movie.",neutral,movie

83968,"When I first read the synopsis for '12 Feet Deep' I thought to myself they are really stretching themselves for film ideas now. How could they possibly make a movie out of this concept, even if it is based on a true story? Now don't get me wrong, not only do I not mind survival films set all in one place, I often tend to love them. My problem with the concept on this occasion though lay in the fact that this didn't seem threatening in any way, and appeared to be more of an inconvenience to those effected. In that sense however I did the film a disservice, because they made quite a valiant effort to make this a genuinely dangerous and life-threatening situation for these characters to be in. Was it enough to carry the film though? Sadly, not quite.I'm not entirely sure how much leeway was taken on the part of the script-writers to veer away from actual events that took place in real life, so it is hard to judge this film as being based on a true story. The biggest thing that lets the film down is the setting. A swimming pool simply isn't interesting enough. Someone buried alive, or trapped under the twin towers, those locations hold a lot more interest and are able to cover up a lack of diversity in a film. A swimming pool simply doesn't hold the same weight.I would suggest that with the concept they had to work with, the film makers actually did a very fine job with '12 Feet Deep' making it what it was. Sadly, I think it was flawed from the point of conception though and there's nothing you can do to change that.",neutral,movie

There also seems to be some attempt at a morality play about classism or racism, as we see humans vs. zombies vs. vampires. Vampire-on-zombie crime is most assuredly despicable, and we should all get along.This vague social commentary gets mixed with the eternal story font: High School is Tough For Everyone, Even the Popular People. If you don't want to feel, you don't have to: just go be a zombie. If you want to be cool, be a vampire. Whatever you do, just make sure everyone sees, so you can make the scene.It's a bad sign when Ed Westwick has the best performance in a movie. Nicholaus Braun rattles off his lines like he can't wait to get to the bar. Mackenzie Davis, however, puts in a sincere performance and is a star-to-be.Freaks of Nature is neither clever enough, funny enough, gross enough, nor serious enough to be much of anything in particular. Even the smooth and dulcet tones of Werner Herzog's voice do little to step up the scene. This is no Cabin in the Woods.",neutral,movie
84122,"The concept of using crude high school humor with a gory horror story is a route directors have been continually making the past ten years. Freaks of Nature is a prime example of this trend by throwing in a plot about the co-existence of teenage humans, zombies and vampires with raunchy one-lines. The comedy for the most part was more hit than miss, very funny at parts but was a little too ridiculous at points. The idea of combining monster genres was a clever idea, the film managing to mesh teenage inner-drama (the world being a cruel existence) along with the evolution of becoming a monster, such as been bitten at the neck by a vampire or on the foot by a zombie. The moral that becoming a hideous monster isn't as far off as becoming an adult human. Enjoying the humor and original substance, I still couldn't find myself thinking this was a good movie at the end of watching it. The plot was scattered, scenes weren't continuously edited right, and the ending completely weakened and fell apart after the primary middle scene, which everything in the beginning built up to.",neutral,movie

84265,"It was only a matter of time for the movies to start flowing in regarding the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Currently there are at least three different films out or coming out featuring this story. One is a big budget release coming in January, another gives it a zombie twist and the last is the National Geographic film Seal Team Six: the Hunt For Osama Bin Laden. There is no mystery about its premise, but this one sports a great cast featuring Cam Gigandet, Anson Mount, Freddy Rodriguez, Xzibit, Robert Knepper, Eddie Kaye Thomas, William Fichtner, and Kathleen Robertson, but does capture the essence of this important moment in history? Seal Tem Six follows the Seal Team Six as they prep for the biggest mission of their lives and the government agencies that set everything in motion to finally end the manhunt for Osama bin Laden. The format of this movie is laid out with a cross between a documentary and feature with the characters speaking to a camera doing interviews about the events leading up to the mission. The movie plays fairly well to attempt to deliver enough information on all fronts to build the tension up to the end result which we all already know. The only real issue here is that there is a lot of unnecessary drama within the Seal Team that really leads to nowhere in the bigger picture. All the cast do a fine job with their characters and bringing this even to life, but at the same time they really aren't given a whole lot to do. The focus here was trying to be mostly on the Seal Team, but this story is more about the manhunt and everything that lead up to their mission, but here that is secondary. There seemed to be an attempt to add a bit more depth to every aspect of this story and it works fine, just seemed a bit rushed with so much content with some of it just not needed.Knowing it was a TV movie for the National Geographic channel actually steps this film up a bit. It has great production value and cast for this sort of movie that you just wouldn't expect. Some of the mission action sequences play more like a first person shooter game that kind of takes away from the film, but at the same time helps to take you in the action in a bit of a creative way. If you have any interest in this important event in our history and everyone should, then you should give this movie a try.",neutral,movie
84396,"""Airport 77"" was the third in this series and it's obvious the quality was dipping with each film. It's a notch below ""Airport 1975"" but far, far better than ""Concorde: Airport 79.""This film deals with a private jumbo jet (owned by none other than James Stewart) that is sabotaged by a couple of halfwit crooks so they can steal some priceless paintings. Then something goes wrong (of course we disaster film afficionados know something ALWAYS has to go wrong) and the plane crashes into the Bermuda Triangle. The rest of the film is the attempted rescue and the standard disaster movie characters trying to stay alive.The problem with the film is that there is no suspense. The only real peril the passengers are in is when water starts to leak into the plane at an agonizingly slow rate. And why have them crash in the Bermuda Triangle and not, say, the Pacific Ocean? Perhaps something mysterious will appear? Perhaps a ghostly presence? Sorry to say but no. There is no reason to set the crash in the Triangle save to use that in the ads to lure unsuspecting viewers in.The typical star studded cast is headed by Jack Lemmon as the pilot. Why Lemmon took this part is beyond me. Perhaps the pay was too great to refuse or he desperately wanted a hit. Either way he sold his talent out on this one. Any grade b actor could have played the part.If you are bored and having nothing else to do then I suppose this is a passable timewaster.

I would catch commercials stating that it would air within days, I never made a point of watching it(in fact, I rather made one of missing it). Tonight, I saw it (as the famous line in Spaceballs goes) for the first time, for the last time. The movie is just not funny. I never laughed, smirked, heck, I didn't even smile. It wasn't charming, clever or even sporadically amusing. I'm generally not into movies about sports... but I have liked them. I didn't like this one. Didn't care for it a bit. Whoopi Goldberg has her moments, but they are few and far between... and none of them are in this flick. The plot is daft and poorly written. The acting is unimpressive. The characters are thin, clichéd stereotypes. The humor is simplistic and unfunny. The timing is off, more often than not. The sports scenes aren't particularly exciting or involving. The score is decent enough, with one or two great songs. All in all, the film is just not all that interesting... it might be decent entertainment for fans of basketball. But then again, the same could be said of Space Jam, and we all know the level of quality presented in that film... exactly. That film may actually be more entertaining, since it at least has one or two comedic talents(take that, Goldberg). I suggest you skip it, unless you *really* want to see a basketball flick. I recommend this to fans of basket and/or Whoopi Goldberg. Everyone else probably shouldn't bother. 5/10",neutral,movie
84464,A magical Buddhist skull has been stolen from its temple. Marshall Seymour (Judge Reinhold) is a high-powered VP purchasing executive for a Chicago department store. He's on a buying trip in Thailand with girlfriend assistant Sam (Corinne Bohrer). Turk (David Proval) buys the skull and smuggles it inside Marshall's cargo. Turk and Lillian Brookmeyer (Swoosie Kurtz) are looking to retrieve their skull. Marshall is the often-absent father to Charlie (Fred Savage). His ex-wife Robyn (Jane Kaczmarek) leaves Charlie with him for a few days. They have a fight and the skull magically transforms them.The first obvious solution is for both of them to go to his job while calling in sick for the school. I would buy it more if Charlie refuses to go to Marshall's work. This is basic but weakly written body switching story. Both Reinhold and Savage are overplaying their switched personalities.

The other important thing that needed to be accomplished was to write a much better script.There was some great visuals in this which hit the spot and were quite pleasing. Some of these scenes can be viewed in the film trailer.I do not fault the actors for the shortcomings of this film, with the exception that they should have challenged the director more regarding some scenes and dialog which were absolutely stupid. Enough has been said by other reviewers concerning this.I felt sorry for Cecilia Cheung in the fact that the director Chen Kaige seemed to try his best to make her look like a wax corpse, rather then a beautiful Princess.This film had a lot of potential, but it got wasted. It is a shame. It is not the worst film in the world, it's just that it could have been really something special.I challenge you to watch it and make your own conclusion.

84657,"Released in 1995, ""Operation Dumbo Drop"" is a Disney flick inspired by the real story of the US Army supplying an elephant for a village during the Vietnam War. Danny Glover and Ray Liotta star as the two officers in charge of the mission assisted by Denis Leary, Doug E. Doug and Corin Nemec. Dinh Thien Le appears as the boy, Linh, companion of the elephant Bo Tat.An NCO indirectly linked to the real operation said the movie was much more interesting and fun than the actual event as the mission was pulled off without a hitch with little entertainment value. Being a Disney flick, the combat situations are ""Yeah, right"" and no one gets hurt, but that's to be expected. Other than this, it's a straight forward dramedy/adventure.While I'm generally not into Disney flicks, it's nice to see a more positive side of the war after watching movies like ""We Were Soldiers,"" ""Platoon"" and ""A Rumor of War."" Believe it or not, there WERE fun, comedic and altruistic occasions over there, every day. Many good Americans perished directly attempting to prevent harm to Vietnamese people. Many risked their lives not in combat, but in aiding civilian villagers in tasks they could not accomplish themselves. Many worked tirelessly to improve the lives of the Vietnamese, providing food, cooking utensils, clothing and other necessities to those displaced by the conflict. Yes, I realize you could argue that they wouldn't be in such a predicament if there was no war, but don't forget that, generally speaking, the South Vietnamese didn't want communistic rule and the conquest-minded NVA were no angels. Look no further than the incredible killing fields of Cambodia.I love elephants, so I also appreciate this element. What's most enjoyable, besides the great cast, are the exceptional Thailand locations. Although there are a few eye-rolling parts, like all Disney movies, a lot was put into making this film. It's a fun adventure reminiscent of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" Unfortunately, there are no key female parts and the ""Yeah, right"" moments are too painful to give a higher rating.The movie runs 107 minutes.GRADE: C+ or B- (5.5/10)",neutral,movie
84740,"This hand-held-footage tale of a group of college-aged people on a camping trip being set upon by Sasquatch isn't great, but it does have its moments.Moments of suspense as they hear sometimes far away sounds, moments of terror as they hear Sasquatch growling and running toward them. One horrifying moment when we see what's his name trying to get away by racing away on a bike, and the creature running along side him, keeping up, with no difficulty. Also two moments of annoying behaviour from obnoxious characters, for no other reason than to have a pair of cheap jump scares within a couple of minutes' time (blasting the car horn, and then slamming the brakes) I don't have a problem with shaky cam, if it suits the plot of the film. My problem with it is that I think it's difficult to sustain a full length movie with it. The creature effects were decent, the acting was hit and miss, there was a bit of atmosphere in the shots of the cabin and woods, but I wonder if the film would have played better with some occasionally stationary camera work, with mostly just Sasquatch's scenes, and a few establishing shots presented as found footage? As it is, it seems like two thin ideas (found footage, and Sasquatch) mashed together and padded to full length. I agree with its 5/ 10 IMDb user rating.",neutral,movie
85109,"Most films that are split into separate parts and tell a story in pieces, come together at the end. All the characters converge, culminating in a terrific ending, but Fragments was different, in that all the characters were together in the opening sequence, and then the film splits into individual stories. The story is centered around a group of people in a diner, when a shooter comes in an opens fire. Following the shooting, we see how each person reacts and how their lives are changed by what happened. It sounds like a very good story and that's exactly why I rented it, however the reverse order of the film makes it somewhat anti-climatic. All the interesting stuff happens in the beginning of the film and what follows, just gets slower, stranger, and somewhat less interesting. The film really doesn't have a single person that you can put the label of star on, but as far as performances go, Forrest Whitaker easily gives the strongest one. Whitaker does almost exclusively independent films and is always overlooked because of it, but this man can honestly play any role and in my eyes is among the elite in Hollywood. On the reverse side, Dakota Fanning's character almost completely destroys this film. After what happened, this little girl finds God and starts preaching to the masses. I'm all for anything that gives people hope and makes their lives better, but when anyone, even a character in a movie, starts preaching to anyone who will listen, it gets very old, very quickly. Fragments is not a bad film, just an unusual one. With the story they had, following the traditional format would have been impossible, but that doesn't mean that this was the way to go. What started out as a terrific film, quickly turned into something that was nearly unwatchable.",neutral,movie

Normally the climax of a film is meant to action packed and entertaining. Here, it just flies by and you don't care. I didn't buy the relationship between Obelix and the Indian girl. The scene where they say goodbye is meant to be sad, but we feel nothing because we only had one scene of them together. Maybe if they had more scenes, that goodbye scene would work properly.Craig Charles is miscast as Asterix. When you see Asterix, do you think to yourself ""Dave Lister should play him""?The guy playing Obelix works though. But the star of the movie is Christopher Biggins' villain. He's such a kiss ass, yet his plan works. And Chris had fun camping it up.I liked the Oxford/Camberidge joke and the Romans forming into a pie and slicing a piece. That joke was well done.The CGI sucks and it's not a film that'll grab you. It doesn't leave you with the urge to watch it again.

Have the Wayans' brothers actually made something that was good? I've never seen anything worthwhile from them. The plot is a simple rehash of hundreds of other action movies. The acting is mediocre, at best. The characters are mostly one-dimensional. The action is OK, but nothing you haven't already seen in hundreds of action movies before this one. I feel sorry for Jada Pinkett, having to play such a stereotypical character; she deserves better. Nearly any actor/actress does.

I'm not worried about giving away any spoilers because I'm not sure there are any to give away. The movie is a sequence of scenes that make you wonder why they are in the film, and frustratingly so because you really never find out. American audiences especially will be shocked by the sex scenes. I'm not saying that's good or bad. We just rarely see a penis in a movie, aside from porn, let alone an erect one, let alone someone interacting with one. The reason I gave this move a 5 is based entirely on its style. The characters often stare at each other with blank faces but they are consistently unemotional. The characters look like real people plucked right off a Mexico City street. The sounds in the film are interesting and graphic, sometimes noisy. But it works to keep you in the film. The filming in Mexico City creates an interesting backdrop.

85476,"When I watched this movie, I was struck by how bland, boring, and predictable it was. It was never actually bad or anything, but it was arguably memorable for being so forgettable. It was only after I came to the IMDb that I discovered it was directed by one of the guys responsible for that utter borefest, The Blair Witch Project. At that moment, everything made sense to me, and I felt totally vindicated in my intense dislike for TBWP (which all my friends, at the time, seemed to think was pure genius). I also realized that this director had done The Believers, which was, unsurprisingly, a bit of a borefest, though the ending was kind of cool (even though it was stolen from a Arthur C. Clarke story). Unfortunately, this movie doesn't really have an interesting twist to save it, unless you're really, really unfamiliar with the last 50 years worth of ghost stories coming out of Hollywood.Eduardo Sanchez, the co-director of TBWP, made a pretty good movie a few years ago, called Altered, about a group of friends who have a really nasty series of run-ins with malevolent aliens. Unlike this one, I walked in to that movie thinking it was going to be crap, but I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. It was suspenseful, gory, and, while it wasn't really original, it still managed to put its own spin on a common theme (alien abduction). Really, it was more a movie about rape than anything else, couched in science fiction/horror elements. This movie? It's exactly what it looks like -- a group of stupid teenagers (played by 30 year old actors, of course), including a depressed girl, the depressed girl's best friend, an insensitive jerk, the insensitive jerk's long-suffering girlfriend, and the depressed girl's love interest (who also happens to be her dead twin sister's ex-boyfriend), spend about 70 minutes getting drunk, followed by about 15-20 minutes of plot, wherein they follow the psychic intuitions of the depressed girl, only to solve a Scooby Doo mystery. Unfortunately, this movie has all the thrills, mystery, and suspense of your average Scooby Doo episode, perhaps due to the PG rating. Amusingly, the ghosts ended up just standing around, in the background, looking as bored as I felt, while I was watching this movie.Prepare to be bored to death, rather than scared to death.",neutral,movie

85546,"Made to coincide with the centenary of the original event, 1911 REVOLUTION is a film that celebrates China's rise from the tyranny of the Qing dynasty into the modern era. It's an unashamedly patriotic movie, with clear-cut heroes and villains, and one that seeks to portray a politically complex situation in a massive country, on an international scale, in the space of two hours. The resultant film is an educational ride and historically interesting, but one that falls down when it comes to the basic facets of movie-making.The film tries to be both a gutsy war film dominated by explosive battle sequences and a compelling political epic, featuring scenes from both sides involved in the revolution. Unfortunately, the editing is quite choppy and the battle scenes, although technically proficient, end up disappointing as you're left wanting more. Characterisation is virtually nil; Jackie bags the best role as the rebellious leader and has a few great action scenes, but everybody else feels like a player in a historical drama, never really coming to full life as they should. There are lots of familiar Chinese actors in various parts, but none of them make much of an impact here.It's a shame, because there's a film with a similar focus, set five years previously, called BODYGUARDS & ASSASSINS, and I found it absolutely spellbinding. That movie manages to mix in the political intrigue and dramatic backdrop of the situation while at the same time telling a rollicking, action-packed storyline filled with melodrama and excitement.

This erotic thriller has everything that a viewer has watched before: it is a kind of teen version of `Fatal Attraction' mixed up with other teen movies. The coincidences, such as Debbie and Tracy being very alike, or the meeting of Debbie with her favorite writer, Sam, irritate me. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe has a pair of wonderful eyes and a very beautiful face. However, in one sex scene with close, the viewer may see some fat and wrinkles on her buttocks, having a sudden cut of the camera in the montage of the film.

He has also relocated to Italy, though this does nothing to stop SIC from tracking him down.You can read pretty much any review or look at the rating on IMDb and you will get the idea that this is a bad film. Now, I do not think it is as bad as most people do, but I do accept a number of things: it is not as funny, the continuity from the first film makes little sense, Goldfoot keeps breaking the fourth wall for some reason, and Mario Bava is better than this.Really, all you have is everything from the first film toned down a few notches. And as much as I enjoyed the first one, it is not really what one might call a great film. What made it work (besides Price) was Susan Hart, so without her the sequel was not going to be as good no matter what you did. Throwing in two bungling, unfunny Italian comics does not make it okay.Troy Howarth has written a fine overview of the film (which he rightly calls ""a mess"") and reviewed it. His words are worth quoting. With regards to Price, Howarth thinks ""this sort of material is quite beneath his talents. All told, this film represents an all-time low for both Price and Bava."" I am inclined to agree.According to Howarth, Bava ""had no enthusiasm for the project and tried to pull out of it"" but he was ""under contract for one more film"". The biggest problem, among many, was that the project ""was to be edited into two completely different films"" and the ""American version, widely hailed as a bomb, is not the work of Mario Bava, as it was re-written, re-scored and re-edited without his participation"". I have not seen the Italian version, but it is not rumored to be any better.If you liked the first Goldfoot, I would recommend giving this one a chance, as long as you are aware that the American version is a sequel to this while the Italian version is a sequel to an Italian film, and both were cut from the same film. Despite all this it still makes sense, but the quality is understandably bad.",neutral,movie
86017,"The horror content here--i.e. when anything bad happens--is so hilarious that this would be an absolute trash classic if the overall pacing weren't so lethargic and the general ambiance that of lame 70s British softcore (without most of the actual softcore content). Peter Sasdy made some better films, but this one is just poorly directed, on top of being horribly written. But hoo man, that script is SO bad it's almost great.Presumably ripping off the prior year's ""It's Alive"" (plus bits of ""The Exorcist,"" with a few odd anticipations of next year's ""The Omen""), the story has Joan Collins ex-showgirl giving birth to a normal-looking baby that nonetheless does completely abnormal things (but only whenever off-camera) because...um, she was cursed by an evil dwarf. And not just ANY evil dwarf, but the one that still works at the club where she used to do a ridiculous dance act with him in musical-comedy ""gypsy"" drag, complete with a tambourine. Yes, we're supposed to believe that went over bigtime at a strip club, where the other women duly go topless.Anyway, said dwarf was unhappy she spurned his amorous attentions (even though he looks so fetching in his jester hat!), so he cursed her, which of course he could do because...er, all showbiz dwarfs are in league with Satan? God only knows; the script can't be bothered to explain. So the normal, angelic-looking baby she later gives birth to supposedly gets up to tearing up its room, clawing faces, pushing babysitters to their deaths, and so forth whenever no one is looking.Needless to say, it's a preposterous movie whose unintentional-comedy joys are only heightened by one of Joan's worst performances. As her husband and nun sister-in-law, Ralph Bates and Eileen Atkins sport bizarre ""foreign"" accents you'd never be able to identify if we weren't repeatedly told they're supposedly ""Italian."" (Couldn't they have hired Italian actors? Those exist, you know.) The other performances are also no better than the material deserves, with the perhaps surprising exception of Donald Pleasance, who manages to preserve his dignity by underplaying every ridiculous scene as Collins' doctor. Anyway, it's a movie with a lot of moments you will howl at--it's just too bad that between those highlights, the rest of it is rather mediocre and tedious rather than inspired camp.",neutral,movie
86198,"Barbara Steele is my all-time favorite actress, and I also have utmost respect for director Michael Reeves for his directing the brilliant 1968 horror classic ""Witchfinder General"" with the matchless Vincent Price, my favorite actor of all-time, in the lead. Reeves' ""La Sorella Di Satana"" aka. ""The She-Beast"", however, was quite disappointing. Steele's performance partially saved the movie, of course, but she had far too little screen time and therefore she couldn't save the entire film. One aspect, which is both annoying and kind of funny about this film is the fact that it is a typical product of the cold war. In one scene, for example, a hammer is dropped and falls on a sickle, forming the communist symbol. In 17th century Romania, a murderous witch is captured and brutally lynched by local villagers. 300 years later English newlyweds Veronica (Barbara Steele) and Philip (Ian Ogilvy) are spending their honeymoon in Romania, near the lake where the witch was executed. When having a tea, the couple get to know the elderly Count Van Helsing, a descendant of the famous Van Helsing family, and learn that the haunted lake is still a dangerous place...I am a huge fan of Barbara Steele and of horror in general, and ""The She-Beast"" is certainly the weakest film with Steele I have seen so far. However, the movie is in some parts unintentionally funny, and even though it is not very suspenseful, a film featuring Barbara Steele is never a complete waste of time. Ian Ogilvy's performance is not too convincing in this one, fortunately he did a way better job starring in ""Witchfinder General"" two years later, a film for which I will always respect director Michael Reeves, who was certainly a promising and great talent for the Horror genre, a talent which was sadly wasted by his early death in 1969. ""The She-Beast"", however is certainly not Reeve's highlight, but a rather dull movie, which can be fun to watch at times, but doesn't deliver the suspense or eeriness a horror flick should. It is certainly no must-see, but if you want to watch it anyway I recommend to watch a few other films with the great Barbara Steele (such as ""The Pit And The Pendulum"", ""Black Sunday"", or ""Castle of Blood"") as well as Michael Reeves' ""Witchfinder General"" first. All things considered, ""The She-Beast"" is a bit disappointing, but watchable (if only for Steele), and worth the time if your're a fan. 5/10",neutral,movie

86448,"When I sat down to watch this, I didn't know too much about it; what I knew was that Wes Craven was one of the producers, and that it was a made-for-TV movie. When it started, I quickly discovered that two things; one, it was one of those mystery thrillers, where you're supposed to guess who the killer is, and two, it's mainly made to scare those who suffer from acrophobia, fear of heights(hence the title). For a TV movie, the production is surprisingly good, and the film does contain a few intense scenes. Since I suffer from a mild case of acrophobia myself, I found plenty of scenes to be scary and intense(not to say that people who couldn't care less about heights won't find them so too, though). The plot is surprisingly good, and does hold water to some extent; I wouldn't call it great, but it's not really that far-fetched. The acting is decent, no going around that. All of the actors are unknowns, which could be(and probably is) why, but it could also be the direction, which, admittedly isn't great(but hey, this guy's only done series and half-bad movies before, so what do you expect?). The characters are well-written, and mostly avoid being overly cliché-like; apart from the lead, none of them seemed like stereotypes. The special effects were OK, not better nor worse than the standard for TV movies. Considering the production values, I was surprised by how much the film actually did manage to shock and frighten me. The mystery was very good; it kept me guessing throughout the film, and when the answer was revealed, I was very surprised. I thought I had considered every possible outcome, but the film still managed to surprise me with the twist. I'm not sure what to draw as a conclusion from that; maybe the films plot is actually good, but just surrounded by mediocrity in the acting, writing and to a certain extent, theme, which drags the film down to just being decent overall... or maybe I'm just easily manipulated. Who knows. All in all, a decent mystery thriller. I recommend it exclusively to big fans of mystery films and people who suffer from acrophobia; since both apply to me, I really enjoyed it. Pretty much everyone else should just skip this one. 5/10",neutral,movie

It is her first movie since then, and she was an interesting character that met an unusual end.The Brits are famous for horror. Remember Hammer? Now, it seems they are famous for movies about radicals releasing animals. We do that here, but I don't know that we make movies about it. I don't think that many people really care over here, so we leave it to Peta.The thing is that the group left one of their members behind on a raid and he got three years. He sends them an e-mail about a secret lab that they should check out. That is when the fun begins; as this lab is underground and some really strange stuff is going on there.Now, I won't spoil it by saying what is going on, except to say that it was an interesting concept. The problem is that I really didn't care about the people in this film, and whether they lived or died.

86565,"In fact I loved the first half. Modern editing, good eye, slow pace, some humor, good soundtrack selection, as well as good color processing. Sweet and cleverly employed references to 80s horror flicks. So, there was a style.Then suddenly they lost it, when buckets (literally), fountains of artificial blood and bloody porridge came to scene. To be honest, I wouldn't call this a gore fest either - there were only two buckets poured, somewhat three fountains and one bloody porridge. Hell, who let the youngsters into the kitchen? Check, please, I'm leaving. If you're a gore fan - go for it, but don't complain then about slow pace and longish shootings on landscapes and buildings. If you're looking for some genre inventions or surprises - miss it, there're hardly any. It's not spooky either.I would only recommend to genre lovers of high tolerance, who can stand the absence of plot and unnecessary gore for the sake of style.

Typical of a low-budget movie, the on-location shooting is hit and miss. You can understand why they had to severely limit the locations, but to say that the locations actually mesh with each other (you'll see what I mean) is really stretching the truth.

This film was a head of its time, with a great Sci-Fi story and robot to go along with the entire horror. There is plenty of action, airplane crashes, jumping out of planes and bombs going off and one crazy looking robot. Dorothy Arnold appeared in this film as a reporter for a newspaper who was always popping up at the wrong time. Dorothy was very attractive and with a sexy figure who was once married to Joe DiMaggio, the famous baseball player who later married Marilyn Monroe.

86768,"Really, the film is as confused as some would argue the cross-dressing military units are. I'm not a fan of John Cleese. That's hardly a secret. I tolerate him on Monty Python, and I will grant that he can entertain, but as a general rule, I don't exactly make it a point to seek out his work(though I do not make as strong efforts as I could to avoid it, either... I reserve that for those that I genuinely cannot stand). This film was purchased for me by someone mistaking it for something having to do with his comedy troupe(with good cause, as its crude pun title was translated to ""Python at the Front Lines""). A rather see-through attempt at passing it off as something it's not, really, as he's not joined by even a single other member of the group. One of the main problems is that this cannot seem to make up its mind on what to be; a comedy or a war-drama. Neither of them are achieved particularly effectively, separate from each other, and whenever the two are attempted at the same time, it's even worse. There are times when the war aspect seems tacked on, as if the writers were busy writing the attempts at comedy, and suddenly remember that it's set during war-time. The drama begot little emotional response from me(albeit I will admit that it did manage some, near the very end). The comedy... I don't know, it seemed to mainly consist of the flamboyantly gay character being, well, flamboyantly gay, and shining a spotlight on the fact that the men, soldiers, no less... wait for it... are wearing *dresses*. Yup. That's about it. I guess the musical numbers weren't bad. Cleese does nothing to amuse, playing it more straight than many of us were aware he was capable of. He plays someone who, at least appears to be(it's not really clear) deeply religious, and I couldn't tell if this trait was supposed to be part of the comedy or the drama aspect of the film. I don't know, if you're into musicals and/or men in drag, you may like it. I recommend this to people in either or both of the aforementioned groups(I won't stoop to the level of suggesting that those who enjoy one are highly likely to also enjoy the other), but I'm not sure who else to steer towards this. Don't watch this thinking that Cleese does what you're used to(those goofy-looking poses that you see on the cover of the home release... they're from *one* bit in the film, during the credits, which is really the only time he's Python-y). 5/10",neutral,movie

Do you think John Gotti, or any other mafia member would let a camera crew film their business? of course these guys aren't going to allow cameras to film illegal activities. if you expect otherwise, it's probably a good thing you aren't involved in some type of criminal activity because you'd end up dead or in jail in about 3 minutes. I'm not saying the show is amazing and i'm not saying it sucks, but is it so far-fetched to believe that the general idea of the story lines could actually have happened int he past? no, it really isn't. it's not like the show is portraying these guys out to be ruthless hit men. they collect insurance money to help other Amish since they probably don't use Geico (oh how i wish they were hit men, then maybe they could take Flo out for good for trying to sell Progressive to the Amish or for trying so desperately hard to be funny), which other Amish are probably happy to pay, because they'd like to have that help if something happens to their chicken pot pie business. they run parties, buggy races/competitions, and do other dumb stuff to make money. if you're looking for some Amish version of the Godfather like these other geniuses who are so mad that the show isn't reality, then you will be disappointed too. the worst kind of 'mafia' work I've seen is them attempting to do is driving an ""English"" guy away from their town for selling cell phones to the Amish.take it for what it is meant to be, an entertaining look into a guy helping to look out for his fellow Amish. my main knock on the show is that they try to make ""Lebanon"" Levi so intimidating when the dude is no doubt softer than a teddy bear (he also resembles one, so there's that...)",neutral,movie

It has a pornographic baseline worthy of an R-rating for the casualness and meaninglessness of it sex and violence (the lack of blood actually adds to this effect) which will please those who regard these as an inherent good irrespective of other factors. There is odd (yet interesting) placement of comedy or comedic intent in a film that appears to be played straight about 98% of the time. Because of this it remains in doubt whether the 98% is as straight as it appears, or if the apparent bad dramatic acting is rather a case of comedic overplaying sneaking in where one would think that it doesn't belong.

87458,"Donald Trump-like developer Rupert King (Malcolm McDowell), missing persons detective Melissa O'Keefe (Talisa Soto), the New York City Mayor, and a number of inmates and an assortment of other characters converge as they are all headed towards Hart Island. Hart Island, just off of the Bronx in Long Island Sound, is home of the infamous ""Potter's Field""--a massive graveyard of the poor and unknown. King has plans to turn the island into government assistance housing. When the graves are disturbed however, supernatural forces come into play to put an end to any tampering.Island Of The Dead begins with a lot of promise. The initial voice-over by O'Keefe is interesting, as it explains that she was an abandoned infant and is now searching for a missing girl from a famous year-old case. The introduction of two prisoners, handcuffed to a ""meat-locker"" drawer in a morgue as they wait to go on burial duty at Hart Island is intriguing. And King is at least passable when we first meet him (McDowell vacillates between passable and good throughout the film).Our trip over to Hart Island, following our cast of characters as they ride the ferry across Long Island Sound, is good, too, and Mos Def, whom we meet on the boat, is funnydeservedly, Mos Def has already been in a large number of films since Island Of The Dead. Even Hart Island is captivating at first. I'm not sure if it was actually filmed on Hart Island, which is still under the supervision of the New York State Department of Corrections and has very limited access, but whatever the location, it is beautifully stark--an appropriate setting for a horror film. With one exception, there is a lot of good cinematography throughout the early part of the film, including the landscape of (or standing for) Hart Island and especially shots of some marvelous dilapidated buildings, where some scenes are set and more should have been. The exception to good cinematography in the early part of the film is a digital video pan across some old buildings, shot from a vehicle or on a dolly, which becomes pixelated halfway through. Apparently, this was the only footage extant of this, and they really wanted to use it, because despite the flaw, it is inserted a couple times.The story up to this point, although perhaps a bit slow and a bit odd at times, such as the dialogue scene between King and the Mayor where we cannot hear what they're saying but instead hear a rap song, is more than satisfactory. Most of the facts and history of Hart Island given in the script are actually true, even though some of it might seem implausible to someone unfamiliar with this New York City oddity (another film which is partially about Hart Island, and worth watching if the island intrigues you, is Don't Say A Word (2001)).However, somewhere around the middle, unfortunately just about the time that the horror material really begins to kick in, writer/director Tim Southam loses his pacing. Not too long after that, he also loses the plot. Some of the horror material is okay--the effects are decent for a low-budget, direct-to-video release, but the pacing kills most of the tension that would have been available. Worse, once we become more familiar with the menace, the ""rules of the game"" get progressively more ambiguous. We don't know why the menace attacks the way it does or who it does, and late in the proceedings, a few characters take inexplicable actions. By the end, it seems like Southam is drawing thriller plot clichés out of a hat and rushing through them because he's about to run out of film. It's even more of a shame because the beginning was so promising.My final verdict, while positive, is just slightly so--a 6 out of 10.",neutral,movie

The plot I think is stronger than the one in the 1994 movie, but slower in pace and does suffer from one or two hasty and over-familiar subplots like Chip stealing Wilma's necklace and framing Fred. I liked it though that it detailed of how Fred and Wilma met, and the scene at the bowling area was sweet with the Nutcracker serving as background music. Mark Addy looks more the part of Fred than John Goodman, but I felt that he slightly underplayed, and I did find Stephen Baldwin too tall and too gormless as Barney. However, Kristen Johnson is wonderfully voluptuous as Wilma and Jane Krakowski, what can I say, better than Rosie O'Donnell. As much as I like O'Donnell, she wasn't quite right for Betty in the 1994 film, Krakowski was perfect. In terms of supporting actors, Alan Cumming is amusing as Mick Jagged and even better as Gazoo and Joan Collins is a sheer delight as Pearl. Thomas Gibson has his moments as Chip. The soundtrack is great, and the scenery, costumes and design of Dino were spot on. Plus that little alien is cute, and the dance routine at the end was lots of fun. All in all, has its flaws but it's a fun prequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox",neutral,movie
87833,"It was nice to have a revisit to the ""Leprechaun"" franchise, despite this deviating quite much from the original movies.But this deviation is not a bad thing; far from it. What this movie lacks in terms of one-liners, funny dialogue and Warwick Davis, this 2014 ""Leprechaun: Origins"" more than make up for in brutality and ferocity.The story is about a group of young people who are trekking in Ireland who come across a small remote village that claim to have ancient artifacts that could be rooting back to the origin of the Celtic culture. But the village harbors a secret that glitters like gold, and the surrounding countryside is the home of a creature that wants that gold.I will say that the storyline was good, despite being predictable and not really bringing anything new to the horror genre.One thing that really annoyed me was the camera work, especially when the leprechaun was in the shot. What was up with the constant focused view, then out of focused view, and back to focused view. It was such a major nuisance, and it really brought down the overall enjoyment of the movie, almost to the point of being as annoying as the 'found footage' movies.I didn't know that Brendan Fletcher was in this movie prior to sitting down to watch it, so that was a nice surprise. Garry Chalk really carried the movie so well with his great performance.It was a shame that whenever the leprechaun was on the screen, then the camera work turned questionable and every other frame was out of focus. From what I saw, then there was some interesting creature design with the leprechaun. And it was a radical change in direction from the previous movies.The movie would have been much more enjoyable if the camera work was consistent and always in focus. And also if they had actually shown more of the leprechaun, then it would have been a notch up in the right direction.",neutral,movie

Most of the pranks from the movie are fake. And for the past year or so, most of vitals's pranks on his channel are fake. They have a very high number of followers, so for them it's easier to make a fake prank and get views and then collect their $$$. I think these guys are sell outs. Now that they are rich from us loyal followers they start making crappy material to watch and keep making more and more of this crap that is over rated and no one really cares about. The first prank from the movie was so sad and scripted. It was hard to watch, I gave this movie a 6 just because I watched it all.

88000,"And that is saying a lot, as the rest of what I've seen(which is a good twenty plus so far) have been utter rubbish. By all means it is not perfect, starting with a first thirty minutes that drags far too much consequently everything takes too long to get going and ending with a rather dumb finale. The music also could've been less generic, and I wish I could have learned more about the characters in general. However, while they aren't going to win many awards the photography is decent, likewise with the effects and there is some atmospheric scenery. The script may have some moments of repetitiveness but is amusing yet serious on the whole(for The Asylum that is an achievement), and while derivative the story does have some suspenseful moments, some exciting action and the hilarious zombie in the dumpster sequence. The acting is not bad either, Mark Dracascos is actually very good in a role that has allowed him to do much more with what he's got. All in all, surprisingly decent, and by far the best of The Asylum movies I've seen so far. 6/10 Bethany Cox",neutral,movie

88286,"I never thought that I was going to say this ever, this is a flick from the asylum that I liked. To be honest, it's my age that made it watchable. You don't get it? Well, I grew up with all those old eighties and seventies horrors and have seen the cheapies this surely reminded me of the copycats out there still unavailable or know to be cheesy. If you watch the Blu Ray cover then you should already know that this isn't going to be a horror that stand up to today's standards. It just looked like those Italian covers back then. And it even reminded me of Shocker (1989)For an Asylum flick it contained rather good effects although some were a bit laughable like the police car catching fire or a girl being ripped in two. Nevertheless, it even contained nudity a few times and a sexy scene were one of the girls actually goes naked but not full frontal. The cheesiness lays in the fact that the possessed ones have red glowing eyes and the good ones blue glowing eyes. The ghosts towards the end are pure CGI and of course the CGI used throughout this flick is one of the cheapest kind. Newbies in the genre will hate this flick, and it shows but old school B flick lovers or cheesy horror geeks should pick this up.

88309,"I didn't expect much from Chopper Chicks in Zombietown. Actually, that's a white lie. I did expect something from the thing, at least something that did not take itself in a SECOND as really being serious. It's not to say that this isn't a flawed movie, or with inanities that could make someone who wants total coherence, fully plausible characters and, say, a 'message' have an aneurysm. It's got the word camp almost inherently in its consciousness. I wondered halfway through (having a tape and not DVD) what the trailer must be like. How do you string together scenes of take-no-s*** lesbian bikers (some at any rate, others you-know-what), cheapo zombies, blind orphans, a dwarf, an incoherent mad scientist, and effects and side characters with only face-value interest? The movie itself plays out like, basically, a biker movie with zombies, where plot- though there- never gets in the way of a trashy killing scene, and establishing shots of the dead ones put to weird carnival music (kazoo included).To describe the different character relationships would be moot; all need be known is that one biker is domineering/cowardly, another very attached to his man (Billy Bob Thornton, yes, ol' Billy Bob) up to a point, and one that doesn't get past any point becoming, basically, zombie bait. It is of note that the man who starts up the zombies in the town, played by the great Return of the Living Dead alumni Don Calfa (included with fully weird eyes and a hick accent amid his Frankenstein mode), basically can't seem to control these things, even as the townspeople almost don't give a damn ('eh, they're family' they say). In the end the Cycle Sluts end up saving a bus full of abandoned orphans (what they're doing out there don't even ask), and finally muster past the reluctance to save the town. It makes me grin seeing the back of the cover, perhaps in an all too ironic way, at seeing this movie compared to Seven Samurai, even just in ""shades"" as the critic says.Along with being camp it's really an example of flawed but pure exploitation film-making. And coming from Troma, a film company that will churn out almost anything in similar capacities that porno movies do, it's definitely not a bad entry. The biker chicks are convincing enough, even as writer/director Hoskins does a flair for the dramatic (i.e. long close-up on the lead biker chick as she prepares to flame up some zombies in the big brawl in the streets), and the oddities help bring so much to laugh at, unintentional or not, that it's hard to find stuff wrong with it on such so-bad-it's-good grounds. It's far from being exactly memorable as a genre film, but for its time it does deliver some stupid fun, with a 60's or 70's biker movie formula wedging in room for both cool and ludicrous living-dead movie set-ups. In short, a terrific premise given decent treatment, no more or less (well, maybe less depending on your point of view).",neutral,movie
88440,"This movie made me nostalgic for a couple of things at once. The first is the series of Edgar Rice Burroughs movie adaptations that came out in the late 1970's, such as ""At the Earth's Core"" and ""The Land That Time Forgot."" Both movies starred Doug McClure, which was okay, but which was sort of like casting Joe Don Baker as Tarzan. This movie goes with a much better lead, the lean, muscular, gritty Sabato, Jr. The other blast of nostalgia was for the 1930's Flash Gordon serials. I could close my eyes and just about hear Buster Crabbe when Sabato, Jr. was trying to speak believable dialogue in ridiculous circumstances. Another thing that made the film reminiscent of Flash Gordon was the filming location - Bronson Canyon.I really have to congratulate the filmmakers for not going the teen heartthrob route with John Carter. They could easily cast a ""cool"" 22 year old with a wild mane of hair and a snotty attitude. I'm so glad that they didn't.The green Martians, quite naturally, suffered from the budget. I mean, there was no way that even a reasonably budgeted flick could pull off two hours' worth of decently animated four armed giant desert savages. As a result, the green Martians are more like the Tuskan Raiders in Star Wars, and that's okay.The weakest link, other than the goofy plot device that sends Carter to Mars in the first place, was the Princess of Mars herself, portrayed by Traci Lords. Someone with the looks and bearing of a Penelope Cruz or a young Caroline Munro (McClure's leading lady in the 70's) would have been better fit for the role. Lords was more like a queen mother than a princess, but she pushed the film along with stern determination.It's unfortunate that Edgar Rice Burroughs' name isn't attached to the piece, but I have to remember that this is an unauthorized adaptation of a 1911 magazine story (book publication 1917) that has been in the public domain for quite awhile.The film also struck me as a slightly pro-Israeli political allegory, but maybe that's just my own overactive imagination. Just watch it for yourself.",neutral,movie
88468,"This is one of the better Asylum productions. The cast is to say above mediocre. You will see a lot of known faces from flicks from the eighties early nineties. So on that part it's okay. This story itself is a rip-off of the Sharknado franchise which is easy to explain because those people are involved.But normally Asylum flicks aren't worth seeing for effects or horror but here the effects are rather okay. It's easy to spot that it's mediocre CGI but there's blood attached and the bites are looking nasty. So okay, for the horror geeks. And the attack on New York looked also believable. So for a normal flick it isn't top notch but for an Asylum flick it is, worth picking up if you are into laughable and over the top horror done on a bad way.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",neutral,movie
88496,"Spiders was an unexpected delight, especially coming from Nu Image, producers of the dire Octopus movies. Nobody could have expected a sequel to bottle the same lightning, and Spiders 2 doesn't but it is still surprisingly fun stuff. It takes a serious minded approach to its shenanigans and even opts for a first half of mystery and paranoia before going for the straightforward creature feature route, an approach which is generally interesting if not entirely successful. The story centres on Alexandra and Jason, lost at sea after investigating an abandoned boat when a storm hits. They get picked up by a cargo ship wherein everybody seems friendly enough, but Jason has his suspicions and fair play to the guy, there are strange goings on afoot. The trouble with going down the suspense alleyway is that the film pretty much gives itself away with the title, and for anyone who couldn't guess the general impetus of the film an early scene shows it off. This means that for all the mystery we know what's going to happen and so instead of being caught in the same mystery as the protagonists we basically watch them play catch-up. Luckily the actors are up to the task of sustaining interest, Greg Cromer showing mounting fear and bewilderment as Jason, Stephanie Niznik sympathetic as the at first stolid and sceptical but ultimately tough and heroic Alexandra, while the best show is put on by a glowering, happily hammy Richard Moll as the nefarious Dr. Grbac. The crew are generally well realised as well, a salty, shifty bunch led by the able Daniel Quinn as their ostensible nice guy leader. The perfomers keep things ticking until the film explodes and fortunately things are worth the wait. A couple of rather nasty gore scenes satisfy the meaner urges, and when the CGI spiders get clustering their rampage is rather good fun, daft but lively. Director Sam Firstenberg is something of a low budget action regular and he handles things with a certain chintzy flair, conjuring excitement out of unpromising effects and the cramped location. Its a shame the film doesn't get moving earlier though, leaving the big excitement to the final half hour may work in a big budget film where the makers can really go wild but here I think some more sustained action would have been better. Also, the writing has its share of blips, gaps and contrivances that wouldn't usually bother me a whit, were it not for the serious minded approach. Still, by and large I liked this one, its pretty sound as its genre goes, has a few gnarly moments and some engaging craziness. Check it out if it sounds like your cup of tea is my advice.",neutral,movie
88583,"""Hellgate"" begins with a narrative-within-a-narrative, as college students awaiting their friend's arrival at their vacation cabin relay the urban legend of a young woman who was kidnapped and murdered in the nearby ghost town of Hellgate. Little do they know, their friend is meanwhile encountering her on a deserted road en route, and the group become embroiled in the bizarre town's goings-on, where the dead are animated by a magical crystal.Quite frankly one of the most disjointed and bizarre concepts I've encountered as a lifelong horror enthusiast, ""Hellgate"" is one for the history books that has been left out of them. Not because it's a good film—it's a very, very bad film—but it's also one of the most ridiculously fun (and ridiculously stupid) late-eighties horror offerings out there. I knew within the first five minutes what I was getting myself into; the opening scene in the ""fifties diner"" appeared to be a reverse-anachronism, sporting so many historical inaccuracies and the heaviest late eighties/early nineties vibes you could possibly imagine, and things just went further down the rabbit hole from there on out. The sets in general are not too dissimilar from those you'd see in a high school play, and the ghost town itself looks like an unused studio backlot that was slapped together to appear as a (thoroughly unconvincing) western town. And yet, in spite of these limitations, the film manages to be somewhat atmospheric in its own bizarre way. Maybe it's the tackiness of the sets, or the way they're shot, but the apparent failed intent contributes to the overall weirdness of the film.As for the special effects—well, gather round, folks, and check out the bat on the string, the exploding fishbowl, and the demonic turtle! The film is also littered with hilarious slow-motion shots during key moments of action. The acting and dialogue is by and large bad, and Ron Pallilo is essentially the only actor here who isn't an unknown (or whose film this wasn't his/her only credit). The script overall is disjointed, and the film appears as if it's trying to be multiple things at once: a creature feature, a slasher film, a ghost story, a sci-fi adventure—it's even sometimes humorous, though the one thing it never quite reaches is seriously ""dramatic.""And, alas, despite all of the majorly problematic things I've listed about ""Hellgate,"" I have to say that I found it as equally charming as it was absurd. I also feel that there is a good skeleton to the film—it is the execution of it that tears it to shreds. The film has a fantastically bizarre, creepy premise, and there are moments in the film where it nears a certain kind of surrealism that it seems to be striving for; the scene in which Pallilo encounters the ghostly Abigail Wolcott on the dark, rural road is a prime example. There are shades of David Lynch (and Cronenberg) here, and while the turnout is far from great, or even good, I felt the core of the film was actually rather intriguing.Overall, ""Hellgate"" is quite obviously a bad film, but it's also supremely enjoyable for a niche audience of people who relish these sorts of bad horror films—and I count myself as one of those people. In spite of all of the film's technical flaws, I do believe there is a solid film here somewhere, but the filmmakers never found it. Even as a lost opportunity, ""Hellgate"" is a one-of-a- kind in its ability to leave you utterly dumbfounded. 6/10.",neutral,movie

88674,"After ""Lady in the Water"" has disappointed critics and audiences alike, M. Night Shyamalan rebounds and reclaims his dignity as a filmmaker with ""The Happening"". I really do not like talking much about a good Shyamalan movie because the power of his movies usually come from the revealing surprises it gives audiences; his movies tend to scare you with something you cannot immediately understand. And Shyamalan is the master of mysterious threats, which is quite clear with this movie. All you need to know is that there is an unexplained phenomenon that is inexplicably exterminating human beings in and around the North American region.This movie is such an enigmatic horror movie that reminds me of Radiohead's music video for ""Just"" and also mirrors classic horror flicks of the 60's, specifically much like Alfred Hitchcock's many works, it also has that Stephen King feel to it. Shyamalan has gone back what he is good at; tapping at the power of fear. And fear is what you get, as The Happening creates a realistic state of imminent threat creating a paranoia that easily infects the audience. The film actually belongs to the Twilight Zone sort of sci-fi suspense; it is freaky and frighteningly mysterious, injected with a B-movie appeal but with a strong sense of realism.The music was also an excellent mood-setter that appropriately enhances its very unsettling setting. The cast gave a convincing performance, with Mark Wahlberg, and the very charming Zooey Deschanel on the lead; they are supported by explosive performances by John Leguizamo, Ashlyn Sanchez, and a very disturbing role played by Betty Buckley. Shyamalan's direction of making the movie simplistic, non-flashy, and just lets its realistic storyline simply unfold without any unnecessary visual gimmicks. The story simply doesn't even attempt to make a detailed accurate scientific explanation, because the main character in this sort of movie is the fear, not the science. The fear feels real up to the point that I feel like I couldn't just wait till the main characters overcome this threat they're facing.Maybe it was just because I expected so little, but The Happening really took me by surprise, and if you ask me, this movie was way scarier than Sixth Sense. If you want a really good scare or a really good scream, and get to learn a little something as well, THE HAPPENING is something you should watch.",neutral,movie

I mean c'mon, if you looked around on the internet you would of known, and the trailer made it apparent. Still I agree that it was a cheesy scam to call this killer croc ""the world's most prolific serial killer"". Aside from that, the movie had a simple (if not too simple) story line. Croc kills important person, team sent to catch it, croc is smarter then them, they try to survive. If you've seen Lake Placid, then this is generally the same idea. Just subtract one croc, set it in Africa, and put a really funny black guy in. Yeah, Orlando Jones does an exceptional job as Steve and makes you laugh more then once. Unfortunately, the other actors are so-so at best. The croc's animation was decent, but I felt he needed a better design. He just looked like a really big croc rather then anything original. And the gore was disappointing. The animated blood in the raining scenes was laughably bad.

The found footage type style often gets used just to keep down costs and makes no sense in the story. In this story however they do make sense of why the main character is using the smart glasses.

We decided to give it a chance.Despite making comments about how they ""ruined the story"" and about some of the changes, my daughter was laughing at the jokes, commenting on the looks of the actor playing Rio, and loving the music. I had to buy the soundtrack for her. After seeing the mid- credits scene, she can't wait for a sequel. Sadly, it likely won't be made.As a Jem fan, yes I'd have liked something that was closer to the source material. But it wasn't *that* bad and shared some of the same themes from the cartoon. (Face it, Jerrica has always had a love/hate relationship with Jem, and is often jealous of her alter-ego on the old show. It was a constant source of conflict.) Easter eggs: there are MANY. So, sure, it wasn't all laid out on the surface, but there were a lot of ties to the cartoon, far more than I had expected.As a parent, it was a great family film. My daughter has never seen Hannah Montana (just before her time), so comparing the two as many reviewers have done doesn't mean anything to her. Even if she acknowledged that it wasn't quite the Jem she has known through the cartoon, she enjoyed it for what it was, and really wants to see the next one.",neutral,movie
89471,"One of the curious things about watching a Hindi film here, is how you get to see the censor certificate before the show begins, with signatories of approval as well as something which I like to spot – the physical length of the film measured in feet, over X number of projected reels. For Veer, this marks the first time I see the censors being quite upfront about the amount of snips down to the movie, which amounted to some 10 ft worth of film. At least you'd come to expect that the film was cut, and here it's for the gratuitous violence which unfortunately had the more gory bits left on the cutting room floor.Salman Khan follows up on the disappointment of last year's London Dreams with this effort directed by Anil Sharma, responsible for what's arguably India's largest film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha. Unfortunately for what Veer had promised to be one heck of an epic set in a time of tumultuous India with factions battling it out for land, and the invasion of the British by virtue of alliances with Indian kings craving that upper hand in military logistics, not knowing that they're being nothing but slowly colonized by their British masters.As the story goes, Salman Khan plays Veer, a Pindari general's child whose clansman were massacred through a betrayal by Madhavgarh King Gyanendra (Jackie Shroff). Fearsome in battle and men of their word, the warrior clan Pindaris are not taking this lying down, and have scattered with a vow to one day exact their vengeance against King Gyanendra. The first child born during their exile, Veer gets taught the ways of the warrior kind, before being sent to London with his brother Punya (Sohail Khan) in order to learn the ways of the Britishers (yeah) and especially their cunning minds, one small step toward their goal of overthrowing the Madhavgarh king through the exploiting of his backer's weaknesses and to circumvent their strategy of divide and conquer over India.Alas Veer has to fall in love in typical Bollywood fashion, and what more in true Romeo and Juliet style. In fact, most of the film adopts this epic love story, which becomes centerstage for Veer's romance, and plot against his father's and people's common enemy. Like the fabled line from Shakespeare's tragedy ""too early seen unknown, and known too late"", he and Princess Yashod (Zarine Khan, a fleshier dead ringer for Katrina Kaif) realize the enormous obstacles lying in front of them, and have to choose whether to fulfill personal desires, that of their father's (in crushing the other side), while shouldering the weight of their people's welfare as well whether to fight another bloody war, or to kowtow to the British who are pompously throwing their weight around.While I didn't appreciate much of the token battle and action sequence in the first half, and even Veer's attack of a train for treasure and the love at first sight encounter with Yashod, the narrative was kept tight in the setting of the premise until you realize it's a love story after all, with Veer being a rather smart Romeo in trying to kill multiple birds with a single stone. The scenes in London where both Veer and Punya enrol in a college, and reconnect with Yashod again, was something out of a high school romance with plenty of song and dance to go around so much that it actually gets boring no thanks to the repetitive romantic theme played until ad nausem , until two tragic turn of events set the stage for a cliffhanger just before the interval. It is in this section that Sohail Khan shines as Punya, used mostly for comic relief and then fading away as an underdeveloped character despite some glimpses of a fearsome warrior in the making.The second half after the interval somehow imploded through its lost sense of direction, and the muddled development of plotting for revenge, fulfillment of promises, and the battling for the hand of Yashod all seemed too scattered. For all the sweeping motion of battle horses and foot soldiers clashing in battle, there was a distinct lack of big battle sequences which are obligatory for a sword and sandals film, and in its place you got a hokey joust with a muscular Caucasian, as well as an emotionally empty father versus son tirade. You cannot deny that Salman Khan tried hard, but it came across as trying too hard yet again, made worst by his display of only two emotions in the entire film – lovelorn and rage, which for some inexplicable reason the latter facial display comes with complete with some cheesy lion-roar effect to accentuate his angry mood.India has its fair share of contemporary epics set in its period days, and two excellent films which I have watched come to mind in Lagaan and Jodhaa Akbar (incidentally both directed by Ashutosh Gowariker). Unfortunately Veer doesn't even come close to matching the standards set by those two in terms of story, action and songs even. You can see glimpses of what Veer had tried to do, but it lacked focus and was poor in delivery, and the final, cheesy and needless scene just drove the final nail into the film's coffin. I'm also sad to say that of the 3 Khans of Bollywood, Salman has yet to impress me with this choice of projects to star in.",neutral,movie

Because that caught me in memories of my youth, that is what also makes a great film, the script, and I can't be grateful enough for this made me remember. The film is not as much of a fiction as many would like it to be. In very realistic way discloses the hyper-sensitivity of youth, the feelings, the special way everything is coming to a man's brain, the sex, the colors, messed up thoughts...and then here are decisions. It is wonderful how Melissa always want to choose what to do with her life, what to feel, how to act, what to search for, but somehow the change is only in her deeds but not in her inside, her diary pickups are often in disharmony with what happens to her afterwards. But although she is in fact doing this to herself, she is just so full of it! And so she is coping with her teenage pain as rational as she can in her age. Of course, the sex. When you don't know what it is, but you want it badly. She is less self-aware then the character played by Liv Tyler in Stealing Beauty, but much more pro-active. She doesn't let situations pass by, she is grabbing what she can of them, she does not wait in a corner. That's what i liked at Melissa. The cruelty of acts and the sweetness of the inside. Unsplittable. And that this movie is more real than a sweet romance movie. It is of the age - if she were a little more older, the tender detailed camera would lost its narrative function. And maybe the casting would pickup another actress. Anyway, I love it more and more. It's telling exactly the teen story, which have been missed.",neutral,movie

I have startled many times, reason why I did not totally dislike this flick. However, the screenplay uses lots of unexplained and unnecessary situations just to mislead the viewer, like for example, the girl Melissa Norman, the nurses drinking blood or even the nightmare of Amy with the mysterious St. Rosemary's Hospital in the very beginning. The performances of Christine Taylor, Shane Brolly and Jerry O'Connell are terrible, and the lead actress spends a great part of the film with the most dreadful and annoying screams.

90263,"First off, I want to say that by now people should know that a Michael Bay movie is not going to be a mind-blowing story. You're here for amazing action sequences. If you've seen or at the very least even heard about the past movies you should know this by now, so stop comparing him to James Cameron and quit complaining about the story because you already know whats in store. That being said, this movie is on par with the first one back in 2007, and way better than Revenge of the Fallen and may even surpass Dark of The Moon. The CGI is incredible. It has come a long way even from the 3rd movie. The action is great, just what you would expect from a MB film. What everybody is complaining about is that the story lacks. Yes it does. But people need to stop being pessimists and start seeing the glass half full. The story is a lot more intricate than any of the other movies.I can't go into detail, but the plot really flows and fits together, albeit after a little thought is put into it. Forget the fact that it's Michael Bay or what's his name Ehren Kruger. The story is good. They really went all out. The funny moments don't feel as forced as they previously did, and let me just stress how much better the father-daughter idea fits than the boyfriend-girlfriend. Everyone plays an important role and has something to contribute to the plot. There were plenty moments where I thought, wow that makes sense. Especially with the dinobots. I love how they are delving more into the world of the Transformers, finally addressing ideas that a person would have. I must say as well Age of Extinction was definitely more emotional than the past three films, but in a good way. And, this time they really set it up for future installments quite beautifully.My absolute favorite part is how this time, every robot gets the proper amount of screen time,with the exception of a few, and they all actually have meaningful dialogue. The transformers are finally getting some character development.The few bots that don't have much screen time I'm completely OK with.As I said before, they did a great job setting up for the next film and those few characters who needed a bit more of the spotlight will definitely be back. The one thing I do see wrong with this film is that despite being nearly three hours, the plot is so much more involved that everything happens really fast and it does get a bit hard to follow. If you're a true fan however, putting in some thought won't kill you.I said it before, and I'll say it again. You're not here for the plot, you're here for some amazing eye candy and a plot that is barely there. Boy does it deliver, not just in what you see, but the plot is an improvement. You would be making a mistake by not seeing this movie. You don't have to agree with me, but despite its flaws, Transformers Age of Extinction just may be the best in the series.",neutral,movie
90295,"Now before I begin this review let me clear the fact that this MOVIE is aiming for the new younger audience. This movie is not focusing on aiming for the fans of the past generation. So lets look at it this way.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is directed by Jonathan Liebsman and Produced by Michael Bay. It stars Megan Fox as April O'Neil, and 4 turtles who don't look that good with the CGI. With this kind of set up, its already predictable that this would be a disaster.As I watched this movie in a theater packed with a tremendous amount of children. I guess I could say, this movie was entertaining for me. The stars of the movie are, hands down the Turtles especially Mikey. They stole the movie in every scene they were in, and I would watch a 1 hour movie with just all of them goofing around and making jokes. However, in fact the movie often negates the fact that the turtles are the main subject in this movie, it circles it's story mostly around April O'Neil. As for her character, I found her annoying at many times. And because Michael Bay has something to do with this movie, Megan Fox had to do scenes for the ""benefit' of Bay as usual. Going back to the turtles, I think that they had nailed them and captured everything that we loved about them, the movie is worth watching because of them. The Villains are one of the weak points of this film. Shredder is a very dull, boring and predictable villain. He is only there for what I believe is fan service. Other than that, his motives are unclear and the reason he is in this movie is for the battle scenes.As for the story, it is filled with unbelievable amounts of cliché. Because of this, I had no choice but to be irritated at times or sometimes these scenes gave no effect to me whatsoever even if the main intention of the scene was entirely different. The evil plot of the villain, was downright cringe worthy, plot holes were circling from there and there. . Clichés and plot holes aside, the story is what I would imagine for children and all of us were to look it that way, then I guess I could say the plot was alright I guess. The action sequences were just OK, there were some that were interesting and some that was incredibly DIFFICULT to watch. I know Michael Bay didn't direct this, but My God. Every Michael Bay action-cliché is in this movie. The Slow Motion, Explosions, Attractive Women and the incredibly shaky camera. I almost felt dizzy watching some of the action sequences. At the end of the day, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a great movie to watch if you want bonding times with your kids or if you're totally high or craving for some pizza. In my opinion, it won't ruin your childhood, in fact it might even remind and bring back old memories of your childhood, with the many references being made in this movie. The kids will love this movie and I recommend everyone to bring pizza while watching it. A dull and boring villain, a mediocre plot filled with a massive amount of clichés and Michael Bay style action sequences. without the Turtles, this movie would be pure trash.Verdict: 6.5/10",neutral,movie
90418,"""Scream 3"" takes us to the Northern California hills, where Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is living in seclusion and immense fear due to the traumatic events that she survived in Woodsboro and at Windsor College. Meanwhile, a Hollywood movie studio is producing a film called ""Stab 3"", the third installment in a movie series based on the events that Sidney has survived. But when cast and crew members begin to die off one by one, it seems another killer has returned, and goes after the fragile Sidney (who is having terrifying visions of her dead mother). Sidney teams up with Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and policeman Dewey (David Arquette), two people who survived the massacres with Sidney, and try to uncover the new killers identity, which may be linked to Sidney's past.The last installment in a very popular horror series, ""Scream 3"" brings this trilogy to end on an entertaining but rather weak note. The script for this film is nowhere near as good as the other two, which is unfortunate considering this film was the ""finale"" of the series. It would have been nice to end the series with a better film - not that this sequel is unbearably bad, but it could have been better. I will admit there are some decent scare moments and a handful of suspenseful scenes, but it seems to me that there's almost too much going on in this sequel for it's own good. The script juggles the Sidney character, Sidney's past, the Dewey/Gail relationship, the cast members of the ""Stab 3"" movie, and more, and the jumping around hurt the film a little. It didn't seem to have a central point within it, and that was a problem, for me at least.Besides the problems that it has, I still have to say that I enjoyed this movie, mostly because of the entertainment factor. The writing wasn't amazing, but it did manage to continue to have some nice plot developments and a few good twists, plus some decent scares and more slight mocking of the genre and it's rules. The setting is mainly Hollywood, so this film has a completely different atmosphere than the second or the first film. I'm not sure if it necessarily hurt the film, but it seemed a little too ""Hollywood"" for me. The cast is good here, with more returning characters and some new ones as well, mainly added for body count, while the others do develop somewhat during the movie. The twist-ending (which is the revelation of the killer's identity) made sense in terms of the story, but I found it to be a little unsatisfying.All things considered, ""Scream 3"" is an enjoyable but problematic ending to an above-average horror trilogy. You'll be entertained undoubtedly, but this movie can't compete with the second or the first films, because it just isn't as good. I enjoyed it for the most part and I have trouble over-criticizing it, but most people will agree when I say that it can't compare with the original film. 6/10.",neutral,movie

Personality and threat, and thus engagement and excitement, are abandoned in favor of jokes intended for youthful offspring, and not even all being good ones, properly set up ones, or remotely original ones, at that. ""Family films"" might have less of a bad name if they genuinely tried to offer something, instead of just throw the lowest common denominator at the audience, hoping that they're either of the age where they find it funny without applying any criticism, or the parents of such, paying for the theater ticket regardless of quality. It is possible to create truly good ones, and ones that are still appreciated by the viewer. The real The NeverEnding Story(of '84, I do not acknowledge the others) is a marvelous example. Wouldn't the children want proper adventure? Perhaps even be challenged, at least a little? Would fairy tales have the appeal they did if there were no consequences to people's actions in them? The plot is far-fetched and squeals sequel(it would scream it if it could, but the puns have gagged it). The pacing is uneven. The ending is unsatisfying. The acting is overdone, possibly intentionally. A new main character is introduced, allowing for more of the intolerable ""shock at seeing something unbelievable"" reaction shots, in case you didn't get enough of that in the one that precedes this, or the countless other movies that have such. The martial arts do have some nice choreography. The effects vary. The DVD holds a wide-screen and full-screen version of this, a theatrical trailer, as well as a reasonable mini-game, called Pick That Flick, where you, from a single frame, have to pinpoint which of the ten titles it is. I recommend this to fans of the Turtles, particularly younger ones, or those who of a mindset that fits with that group, it being at whom this was aimed. 6/10",neutral,movie
90972,"Yes, this film was banned and heavily censored in a few places for being disturbing. It does have some really well done gruesome scenes but the real censorship came from the cruelty to animals. Let's just say this film doesn't have ""no animals were harmed during production"" scrolling the end credits. The animal killings include a pig being shot in the head from close range, a muskrat being slit open for no reason, a giant turtle being split open in an overly long scene and a monkey getting his brains bashed in which required two takes so two monkeys were killed during production. These were real killings and not faked. A lot of the actors on the set protested this but the show went on. In fact, one of the lead actors feared for his life thinking this might be a ""snuff"" film and might meet the same fate. As much as this bothered people, is it really that different then buying meat in a supermarket? At least it made me think. The movie centers around ""found footage"" of a group of documentary filmmakers. The filmmakers are in South America searching for a tribe of flesh-eaters, hoping that this documentary will win them fame and fortune. The movie was marketed in a way that made viewers believe all the documentary footage shown in the movie was actual footage of a group that really went to South America to do a documentary.

I was lucky enough to get the boxed DVD set of Nightmare on Elm Street series and I just finished all the sequels and while the fourth isn't a bad sequel or continuation of the story, it was pretty silly. It was cool to continue on with the dream warriors who were clever enough to defeat Freddy in the third Nightmare on Elm Street. But Freddy's back and he is more ticked off than ever and you know that's not good. But while the story was a good idea, the way it was executed, I wasn't really that into it, just the acting I think is what killed it for me. The way the movie was made was what made it feel like it was more of a cheesy TV show like on the Sci-fi Channel than an actual movie.We start off where the third installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series left off, the kids from the hospital are now grown up and are all on their own. But they are quickly killed off by Freddy hoping to get Kirsten back to help them, but they are too late. But when Kirsten finds a girl, Alice, she finds out that Alice has the same powers as she does. She has the ability to pull other people into her dreams and of course Alice is scared to find out how to use her powers, but she may just have to use them since Freddy is now after her and other kids too.A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master was a good enough sequel, but it just could have been better. I liked it, but so far it's not my top favorite sequel. Again, we've got some very cool deaths, don't think I could choose one, I think the water bed one was very cool.

It was truly a great comedy, but it didn't show the light hearted side of surrogacy I was hoping for.I went into the theater wearing a proud surrogate tee shirt, and came out with my sweater zipped over it.Surrogacy is something that is extremely controversial, and we needed a movie that showed the good side of it. It's so easy to imagine what can go wrong in a situation like that, but the truth is, it's NOTHING like that. It's a very beautiful, amazing thing, and I know that first hand.They portrayed the surrogate as white trash. But I have a group of surrogates I've become very close to, and they are the most insightful, smart, caring women I've ever met. I've yet to meet a white trash surrogate. I've also yet to meet an intended mother who would enlist the help of someone who smokes, lives in a bad neighborhood, who's in an abusive relationship, etc... It simply doesn't happen like that.For those of you questioning why she wouldn't just adopt...The simple answer is what she said in the movie. It can take 5 years to place a child with a single woman, and she felt her biological clock was ticking. It had nothing to do with money. Yes, surrogacy is more expensive than adopting. ($100,000 is completely unrealistic, by the way...) Surrogacy is not a way of avoiding adoption. It's simply another option.The more complicated answer is why would you care? Most people are blessed being able to have children. And nobody ever asks them why they didn't adopt. It's a very personal choice.

Cue lots of awkward situations and a cute love story and there you have it.Selena Gomez is quite nice to watch, as is Miss Meester and Katie Cassidy, all three girls have their own storyline throughout the film and each get their chance to shine. Full props to Selena for being entirely convincing as a snooty British snob, she nailed it. The one thing I didn't get was everyone in the movie from Texas has a Texan accent except Selena, I don't know if this was a deliberate mistake or just plain laziness, but for me it was the only thing that bothered me.The movie is quite girly, not that that's a bad thing, that's the target audience, but for me it was still easy to watch and enjoyable enough. Give it a go, its not a classic teen film but hey, it's nice enough for a movie night with the girls. :)",neutral,movie
91213,"This film is great for fans of Chris Farley. Since I am a fan I liked it more than most people would. But if I really look at this movie as a normal moviegoer and not biased I'd say it's a silly, messy, clumsy piece of work.The story is just there to show off Chris Farley's goofiness which it does quite well. None of it believable for a second but I don't think it is supposed to be.The music used throughout fits it good enough. The acting is average at best. Of all Farley movies this is one of the best.Overall I would definitely recommend this film to fan's of Farley's antics. See it for that reason only.",neutral,movie
91214,"I agree with most of the past commentators. This film is a half-sequel, half-remake. So many elements were simply copied from the original film. I'm sure the filmmakers considered this homage, but it comes off as a lack of ideas. And we won't even go into the monumental plot holes. Gigantic plot holes. Brobdingnagian plot holes. And while I hadn't previously noted the enormous amount of glass breaking, until reading the comments, yes, I'd have to say they made it more or less a motif of the film. Murphy and Nolte did reasonably well resurrecting their respective characters, and there were some truly funny moments, and truly snappy repartee. But it's not enough to save this one. If you liked the original film (and who didn't) you should probably see this one, just don't have high expectations for it.",neutral,movie
91283,"Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen are a great comedy team. In fact, the best part of Guilt Trip is when the credits are rolling at the end, and there are several scenes that the two of them apparently improvised during the filming. If the whole movie had been as entertaining as those outtakes, I would have given it a ""10."" Unfortunately, the makers of Guilt Trip appear to believe that a movie requires a plot, and sadly, this one was clunky. For a comedy film to work, you either have to completely put reality aside (Blazing Saddles or Rocky Horror Picture Show), or somehow believe an unbelievable story (Airplane or the Blues Brothers). This film didn't fall into either category. The plot just wasn't strong enough to support the premise that any son would be crazy enough to take his mother on a long business trip with him, and there was no reason why he kept bringing her to all his business appointments. And his mother's nutty revealing of her deepest family secret, and her insane baby-naming system, were clearly tossed in just to provide somewhere for this film to go.Don't get me wrong. I'd really like Streisand and Rogen to do another road trip together. But next time, let's just say that space aliens abducted them and forced them to travel together. And let both of the stars ad lib their way through the adventure. I'd pay to see that one.",neutral,movie

91356,"I've had the privilege of watching the worldwide premiere of Arthur and the Minimoys on Friday, December 1st 2006. French director Luc Besson (Leon, The Fifth Element) arrived at the ""Yes Planet"" theater in Ramat-Gan, Israel early afternoon, to attend the show. Right before the screening began, he asked the audience to open it's heart, and added something about the film being aimed mainly for kids. He was right.Maybe it's that bitter 26-year-old guy in me that just couldn't let go of that aching sarcasm that prevented me from really enjoying this half CGI animated/half live action film. Maybe it's the fact that i've just seen so many similar products through the course of my life, that I found it heard to be excited or (god forbid) enthusiastic during this one. Whatever the cause, I couldn't help but reaching the eventual conclusion that Arthur and the Minimoys didn't live up to it's potential. If Besson had just moved one step forward with his imagination, if the twists had been just a tad more original, if the ending hadn't felt so quick and rushed - I could have had a much better time.The plot line is easy to follow: 10 year-old Arthur, played by Freddie Highmore of Charlie and the Chocolate fame, lives in a small town with his grandmother, portrayed by Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby, The Purple Rose of Cairo). It's the early 1960's and Arthur, who is neglected by his parents, escapes his loneliness by hearing stories of his absent grandfather's journeys to imaginative lands. Reality, however, is grim, as Grandpa has been missing for three years and Grandma must raise a large sum of money in 48 hours, or her land will be seized by the local authorities. Determined to save the property, Arthur sets out on a journey to the land of the Minimoys, extremely small beings who live in his garden, in search of expensive rubies that can put an end to Grandma's debts. From here on out the story turns CGI, as Arthur is shrinked to the size of an average Minimoy himself. On his journey, he falls in love with princess Selenia (voiced by Madonna), befriends a rastaman underground dweller named Max (Snoop Dog) and faces the evil being referred to as ""M"" (David Bowie). While the animation is colorful and filled with imagination, the plot moves so fast you don't have much time to really notice the details. Also, there are some supposedly subtle remarks about sex, marriage and corrupt leaders which I don't think are fully appropriate for kids.Bottom Line, Arthur and the Minimoys is an OK ride, but nothing we haven't seen before. From the recent animated The Ant Bully, through the classic 1980's Honey I Shrunk the Kids, the famed story of King Arthur and even The Matrix - it's all homaged, if not copied, in this new entry.",neutral,movie

91522,"Before I begin my review, I should probably start by saying that I'm actually quite a big fan of Rob Zombie the musician (including White Zombie), and I also liked his first two movies (House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects) very much - and I hated the first Halloween-remake so much, that I didn't even want to see the second one he directed, which allegedly should be even worse. So, with that in mind, here's my review: The film is about a young, trendy rock-radio DJ, Heidi (Sheri Moon Zombie), who suddenly finds herself in the middle of an occult Satan-worshiping witchcraft scheme, because her ancestors did something bad 400 years ago or something.. She's sent an old, crusty LP, which she (of course) plays on the radio, even though it's just a bunch of creepy, monotonous notes, played over and over again, giving all the local women in the town zombie-like headaches. Now, this isn't just all there is to the story, but it just as well might have been, as the plot doesn't really seem to develop much from that point on. The movie is all about setting a mood, showing creepy images, and basically just making the viewers generally uncomfortable - which it actually succeeds doing. I felt bad watching this, but strangely attracted to it at the same time.The cast is pretty good actually, with Jeff Daniel Phillips and Ken Foree as the other two radio-hosts, and Bruce Davison as the historian who tries to get to the bottom of this whole witch-thing going on. The problem is just, that the movie doesn't really go anywhere with it's plot, and it's not really a slasher-movie or exorcism-movie, which you could expect. It's purely about making you feel miserable, and that's not (always) a good thing.Oh, by the way... if you're expecting to see a lot of Sid Haig and Michael Berryman, think again, as they've only got small non-talking, not-interesting cameos. Meg Foster is pretty good as the witch-""queen"", though.",neutral,movie
91546,"I enjoyed Air America even though it wasn't the most original story ever told. Mel Gibson is very good in a role that seems written for him.

91552,"Review: I'm really surprised that this film wasn't a massive hit because of the cast, who seem to be on fire at the moment. Its not like the film is that bad either! The intense drama throughout the movie, made it interesting and the storyline is well written. It's about a man who falls in love with a very strong woman who joins him in, in his quest to build his timber empire. After a couple of his close friends decide to go behind his back and join the people who are against the project, she simply takes care of business because of her strong love for her husband. You then get to see a dark side of her character and when she saves one of his workers from a near death experience, he becomes her evil doer. There are some other elements to the storyline which made it a decent watch but I won't want to spoil it for people who haven't watched it. The performances were great and I liked the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. The ending was great and the whole look and feel of the movie made it believable and unpredictable. Anyway, I personally think that it's worth a watch, no matter what the critics say. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Man, this movie really tanked at the box office but I really can't understand why. Bradley Cooper, who got nominated for an Oscar for American Sniper, can't seem to do wrong at the moment and with the hit Hangover franchise, Silver Lining Playback and American Hustle behind him, I'm really surprised that this movie didn't get loads of money pumped into the distribution. I personally didn't hear about the movie before it came out on DVD, so there must be a reason why it was kept low key. Jennifer Lawrence has also had her career boosted with the The Hunger Games franchise and with great performances in the X-Men franchise, American Hustle and also the Silver Lining Playback, so she has obviously stamped her mark in Hollywood. She has recently been plastered all over the papers because of the leaked pictures from her phone but I doubt that, that will damage her reputation. Anyway, there are some other goods performances from Rhys Ifans, Toby Jones and Sean Harris so there's a great mixture of characters who make the movie enjoyable.Budget: $30million Worldwide Gross: $3.7million (Terrible!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about a man who finds out the dark side of his wife after various people on there timber plant, get murdered. 6/10",neutral,movie
91592,"This film was responsible for the bankruptcy of the company behind it, Carolco. Which is a shame, but the film is not as bad as it is rumoured to be. Far from it. It's above average oldfashioned entertainment.The soundtrack alone is a standout. Sweeping and powerful, it serves the plotline well and it's a joy to listen to on its own. Although the characters aren't among the most complex and well defined in movie history, they work (with a couple of exceptions, among them Maury Chaykin as John Reed, whose acting just doesn't match the tone of the film). And then there's the beautifully reconstructed pirate ships, well choreographed action sequences and terrific special effects.
In short this is a film that has an unfair rep and it is really worth your time. A great warmup for Pirates of the Caribbean (which hasn't opened yet in this neck of the woods).",neutral,movie

Once she discovers about going to England, it starts making her a little moved and isolated as well as her three most crucial companions but soon recalls her supernatural-ness to see her friends with closed eyes.

91825,"I saw a preview of this film with kids 6, 7 and 12. We are a dog-loving family, so perhaps we were biased to enjoy the film. That said, we were split on our review. The adults and 12 year old were bored; the two youngsters were thrilled! Hence the score of 6.Overall, this was a harmless movie featuring a few humans and many trained dogs. It was sugary and nice - there was no real threat anywhere in the film of something bad happening (thus it is kid-safe for very young kids). And they've reduced the idea of foster homes down to a concocted McNugget of a concept. My younger kids didn't even follow that theme at all.What they did follow, and what I found most redeeming, were the numerous cutesy dog tricks and toys. The creators of the film did a nice job inventing clever ways to mechanize the caring for dogs (think the breakfast scene in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang). That was fun. And the dogs were cute.For me the drawbacks were these: Slow start, unfunny 'comic' characters - like the foster parents and dog catchers, and a lame plot.But ultimately - we had a nice outing, and you will too. And you will emerge from the film MORE likely to go get a dog of your own.",neutral,movie

91996,"No matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",neutral,movie
92045,"I went to see this movie with only one expectation, surely it cant be as bad as the second film. On this front i was greatly pleased as the sense of smugness surrounding twelve has been completely lost. The only real problem i had was that after the film finished i really struggled to remember anything particularly about it.The performances were all OK but no one really stood out, whereas Matt Damon was the only person i didn't want to slap in twelve, he never gets the chance to shine. Al Pacino has no chance to make a memorable villain out of the limited screen time leaving you not really caring if they can pull off the job or not. Clooney and Pitt also do an OK job of an average script, but it never rises above OK.The area i think this film falls down is with a cast that is too big, while inventive and different in the first film, just hinders this one. There are too many people trying to get their five minutes on screen to really give a damn. Maybe this is the directors feels we already care about them as we know the characters, when in reality the damage caused by twelve was enough to need character building again. Arguably a plot on a smaller scale would have been better with a sharp focus on one or two characters as in the first film.While flashy this film is all about style over substance and if you are looking for a shallow but entertaining summer movie this may just be it.",neutral,movie

92154,"Now You See Me 2 wins the title for most unnecessary sequel, maybe of all time. The first film was a surprise with decent twists and performances. It was a success, apparently to the point where the studio thought the audience needed more. We didn't and this film doesn't really offer anything new and it expects us to really be invested in these characters and their story. Yet neither of these things are really compelling enough for a second go-around. As a result, this sequel just manages to be serviceable.The Horsemen are in hiding and the FBI are on the hunt for them. It's been over a year and now the stage is set for their triumphant return. Just when they reappear in the limelight, the trick seems to be on them. Their entire stage was hijacked and they find themselves at the mercy of Walter, a mad genius who needs their skills to steal a microchip. In this battle of wits, which magician has the upper hand?I begged my wife to see The Conjuring 2, but she was terrified of the original and absolutely did not want to see the sequel in theatres. Double that for the fantasy adventure film Warcraft, so we were stuck seeing the magic heist flick Now You See Me 2...why this wasn't called Now You Don't, me and millions of others apparently will never know. Most of the cast has returned with the exception of Isla Fisher and Mélanie Laurent, with the former disappearance explained away with a few bits of dialogue. In her place we have Lizzy Caplan, who seems a lot more at ease with the cast and the material. One of the welcomed additions to this sequel. While the original was somewhat refreshing, this one treads the same waters. I was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns the original offered us, here everything is telegraphed and predicted a few scenes beforehand. Thus the magic is gone, to a degree. The spectacle is still there is some sequences, yet the revelation is timid. I had to stop thinking about logic a lot of times in order to enjoy the spectacle. One sequence involving the team throwing a card between each other to keep it hidden from people inspecting them, was really well done. But why do they need to throw it to each other? Why not just have one of them keep it and continuously hide it? I don't know. Double goes for a plot hole that I simply do not understand involving a fake chip and the real one. NYSM2 doesn't bother to explain much that makes sense and instead tries to explain what we already know. As I said before, Caplan is the one good addition the film does. Most of the cast seems to sleepwalk through their roles, especially Eisenberg. The second new addition is Daniel Radcliffe, who despite playing a ""magician"" does his best to shed that Harry Potter persona. Between his role in Horns, here and the upcoming Swiss Army Man, I hope he manages to do it. NYSM2 is again, a pointless sequel that manages to entertain enough to warrant a view if you're a fan of the original.",neutral,movie
92242,"This was an enjoyable film for the most part, Night's talents as a director really shone in this film, through his use of framing and colour choices. The final product really highlights the care and thought which Night put into the visual choices of the film. His downfall however is that though he may be a good director, he's also a terrible writer, this is a film which has had 2 great films worth of build-up, and for it's first hour and half, Glass was actually a very enjoyable experience and worthy successor to its predecessors. Willis, McAvoy and Jackson were all wonderful, their characters were incredibly entertaining to watch and their interactions with each other were bloody brilliant. However, unlike its predecessors, Glass was unable to maintain its momentum in its final act, which left me thinking Night chose an ending purely based around the surprise factor rather than a more logical approach. The writing just wasn't very good in my mind, perhaps in his mind, the ending to Glass made perfect sense, however as a viewer i felt i didn't get the satisfaction of fully understanding the motivations and reasoning behind the character choices in that final act of the film.
The large amount of characters featured in this film may have also attributed to this film not working as well as it could have, i think this is because there was a lack of focus. We have 3 main characters, but you don't really feel like you get to spend enough time with any of them through the movie, because there isn't enough focus placed on the characters before the scene transitions. The side characters are also heavily under-used, these characters have scattered and somewhat out of place scenes throughout the movie which i thought could've been completely left in the editing room, with the exception of Willis' character's son, none of the side characters really needed to be in the movie until the final act.I still believe this film was an enjoyable experience, though the ending leaves much to be desired, Shyamalan ends his eastrail 177 trilogy with a fairly mixed bag of a film.",neutral,movie

Now, I'm not saying this is a brilliant film, because it isn't. It's rather easy to guess the plot twists, the script does tend to patronise the viewer and the final segment of the film casually abandons the central premise in favour of a more generic 'mystery' storyline. But I found quite a few things to like about the movie, such as strong performances from Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen, very stylish direction and (for most of the movie)a genuine undercurrent of tension as the events unfold. It's not going to be remembered as a highlight on the careers of anyone involved, but if you enjoyed conspiracy theory novels such as The Da Vinci Code or shows like the X-Files, you are more likely to see past the critics and enjoy this film.

92366,"Encompassed with episodic rhythm and an awfully conventional format, Scott Cooper mutates a story of rich soil capable of greatness to a detaching and routine crime film. Black Mass grasps only on the superficial layer as it focuses solely on documented events of the crime they organized. Due to this, the movie suffers as it seems to be merely a biography- laying out these horrific events in these specified timeframes but not putting any focus on the characters that performed it. All action, but none of the story that happens between that allows the audience to view who they are and what they're like. Black Mass fails to delve deeper into the roots, and this of course limits the scope of all the actors. Great mob cinematography such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the Sopranos- all of these were so great because they allowed the audience to see what the characters were like when they weren't shooting, beating, or plotting against people.That being said, in their limited boxes boy do these actors put on a show. Led by Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, the audience can tell straight from the start that this cast reveled and lived their roles. With the amount of overwhelming, heinous events; the film had to have someone cold-hearted and sleazy, and woah did these actors become the epitome of that. However, due to this heavily limited character, the only ""rise"" the audience feels are from the bone-chilling actions that these men did. Black Mass fails to captivate. And when the closing credits roll a feeling of disappointment washes over you, as it feels like you just watched an episode on the ID channel with really, really good actors.",neutral,movie
92408,"I'm beginning to see a pattern here, and I'm thinking that The Transporter, if it has the legs for more movies, could be the franchise equivalent of being a poor man's cousin to James Bond. Created and written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen for three installments so far, the character of Frank Martin is a roguish looking strongman with a penchant for suiting up when going about being the best of the best in personalized delivery, with no questions asked, no names, and a whole host of other rules which he will of course break during the course of the movie.Like Bond, he drives a cool, sponsored signature car. While Bond has his Aston Martins and BMWs, Frank Martin traded his BM in the first movie, for the armoured Audi A8 W12 which he has brought over from the second film, and here, that sweet supercar got to be put through even more punishment. It also shows itself to be a cut about the rest in being waterproof too, and an occasional dunk in the river won't put out the powerful engine, with tyres that self-inflate too (ok, so just in case you don't realize, I'm pointing out mistakes).And it follows the Bond formula in having the Chick of the Flick highlight too. Shu Qi came on board in the first film as the vixen who traded her body to convince Frank to take the job. Then we had the good girl-bad girl combination for Part 2 with Amber Valletta and Kate Nauta respectively. Here, model Natalya Rudakova, with her very obvious freckles getting in the way, continues from where Shu Qi left off, being the flower vase who can't speak English fluently no thanks to her strong accent, and that's fine since their characters hail from a non-English speaking country. Director at the helm has been round robin too (now by Olivier Megaton), with Hong Konger Corey Yuen crafting the first movie, before taking the back seat in every film by taking charge of how Frank Martin does hand to hand combat. So we do get to see some consistency in the technique that Jason Statham adopts in performing martial arts and various stunt work on his own, and Statham definitely has what it takes to fill up the void of having the lack of Western action heroes on the big screen. I suppose with more hits under his belt (pardon the pun) he could cement this status, and I sincerely hope that he avoids the plague of being relegated in his later years to the direct to video market.As far as the story goes, it just provides a basic premise and an excuse to see how our hero gets to sit behind the wheel again. The Frank Martin now is more laid back, and spends most of his leisure time with the French detective Tarconi (Francois Berleand) whom he has befriended now. Until of course his reputation catches up with him, and in a Crank inspired moment, has to do what he does best for the bad guys, much against his wishes. The villains almost always seem to be part of what's topical at the moment, and this time Frank Martin has to contend with some eco-terrorists who are blackmailing a minister, involving some permit for industrial waste.But who cares about any semblance of the plot anyway? We're looking for some adrenaline pumping, high octane action aren't we all? And here's where it takes a slide for the worse actually. Unlike Bond, there isn't anything new or refreshing to keep the audience engaged and away from the deja-vu feeling. For some reason, Besson and Kamen's story seemed to be stuck in a lot of drama and talk-talk-talk, giving our hero not much time to flex his muscles. And when he gets the chance to, it's the same old one-man-surrounded-by-thugs routine where he effortlessly dispatches them all with aplomb.Such fight scenes are becoming common in The Transporter franchise, and Corey Yeun definitely needs to rejuvenate his action sequences designed for the franchise pronto. There are only two major fisticuffs scenes, and they all follow the same routine, which spells boring. And apart from that, we get the usual complementary car chases which seem to be rather standard with the usual camera shots and angles capturing the action too.Fans of the series and of Statham will no doubt make a bee line at the box office for this, but I suspect that should there be any more thoughts on extending the franchise beyond the three films, then while the formulaic plot format can be kept, the action better be innovative because nobody likes seeing the same thing twice. Since different directors got a chance to have a go at the franchise, perhaps a change in action choreographers might give Frank Martin the lift that he needs.",neutral,movie

92437,"I saw an advanced screening of ""Adventureland"" on my college campus tonight. It chronicles the coming-of-age tale about James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg), who has just graduated from college and is set for a trip to Europe before he goes to grad school at Columbia University. The only problem is that it's the late 1980's, the economy has taken a downslide, and his dad's job got caught up in it--he was transferred to a position that offered less money, and now James's trip to Europe is canceled, as is his monetary support for his continued schooling. This means one unpleasant thing: James must get a summer job. And the only place this comparative lit major can find labor is at a miserable amusement park called Adventureland. But of course he meets and falls in love with a girl (Kristen Stewart), and from there the movie is pretty easy to follow.I must say, this movie was done quite adequately. There was nothing wrong with it. The acting was good (for the most part). The screenplay rolled along safely with lots of chuckles and a handful of belly laughs. There were pockets of insight sprinkled throughout--especially in dealing with the dead-end of indecision that some lives take after college, and in the economic crisis of the late Reagan era that resonates with what we are going through now.This is Greg Mottola's next film after his breakout hit ""Superbad,"" and thus audiences are likely to draw comparisons. Already I can tell you the general consensus: ""Superbad"" this is not. I'll admit that Superbad also had a rather formulaic premise, but something in the execution of that film puts it a few hefty steps ahead of this one. As I said before, there is nothing wrong with ""Adventureland."" It just doesn't stand out as really all that excellent. It hit all the notes, just not as hard as it could have. The acting, while good, does not have the charisma of the Michael Cera & Jonah Hill duo (though Bill Hader re-teams with Mottola in a consistently funny role as the manager of the park). Nor is the romance completely fresh: despite good actors and realistic portrayals, it seems to fall into some of the old genre favorites--the inevitable fight followed by the inevitable reunion. You know the deal.But taking it as its own film, ""Adventureland"" isn't bad at all. It's worth watching, perhaps even in theaters. It's a good date movie, though not one that you'll remember vividly in the years to come. Just have a good time, and this movie will be good for laughs and a bit of the old feel-good familiarity in which we all like to indulge once in a while.7/10",neutral,movie

I have not seen the the first ""Destination 1"", so I can't comment on comparison's between the two at this point. I had seen this movie by chance and knew nothing about it. It started off okay, then quickly got into to the main ""substance"" of the movie, which I can fairly accurately describe as ""carnage"". This is definitely a movie for fans of gore. It's not particularly scary, but has a type of ""tale of the crypt"" feel to it. I found it not particularly funny, but still amusing. There was one scene that had me reminiscing about a scene from the movie ""Cube"". It's not for you if you're looking for romantic comedy or something like that. Also not for you if you're expecting elaborate plot twist thriller. Also, there is no ""skin"" in this flick, but they do throw in the customary blonde chick. Anyway, I definitely put this as above average on my list of ""B"" movie ""sleepers"" (meaning under-rated and surprisingly good). So, my rating is based on that.",neutral,movie

I do have to say the aliens kind of reminded me of the creatures in the movie DESCENT just with armor. The movie itself had a feel of the original ALIEN movie. Now to what I enjoyed about this movie was the way the story evolved into a edge of your seat thriller with twist after twist. The story is what separates this from other spaceship, scifi movies. Even leaves the viewer thinking ""what if"" this happens. PANDORUM is a good way to enter this fall season.

92839,"A movie about Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud directed by David Cronenberg? That sounds surprising and interesting, to say the very least but the movie as it turned out, was far from anything interesting to watch.There are really multiple causes. The first and foremost problem is obviously with its story. And not just only the story in itself but also the things its emphasizes and puts its focus on. It makes some bad choices with this, which makes this movie feel like a very dry and distant one.The movie is mostly focusing on the 'romance' between Jung and his mental patient, played greatly by Keira Knightley. Nothing wrong with that, if only the romance was anything really romantic or something to feel involved with. It instead just feels wrong and dirty and besides isn't made all that believable. Why, out of all of his patients and opportunities he must have had in his life, does Carl Jung suddenly decide to have an affair with this particular woman? What was so different or intriguing about her? This movie really doesn't give you the answers to any of this.And if you think that this movie is being one that is sort of showing the rivalry between Freud and Jung and their opposing psychology methods, you are completely wrong. There is never any interesting dynamic between the two of them, which is granted also due to the fact that Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud, is hardly in the movie at all.And don't know what their methods were and why there are still being used in today's psychoanalysis and why the both of them are being regarded as the two founding fathers of psychoanalysis? Don't expect this movie to show or tell you anything! It really remains on the surface all, as if it was afraid for its own subject and that it might loose some of its viewers with it.In other words, the movie really isn't telling you anything interesting and it's mostly being an unusual romantic movie, you'll get very little out off.All a same really, since the movie itself remains well made and acted out. It's a pretty good looking movie, with all of its historical sets and costumes and the actor's play their roles convincingly. It at least still makes the movie watchable but it's barely enough to keep you interested in it.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",neutral,movie
92900,"Andre Ovredal's previous film ""Trollhunter"" was a surprise hit back in 2010, nobody (myself included) expected a movie about giant trolls to be anything other than a cheap B movie, but it was actually quite good and very entertaining. Now Ovredal is back with another somewhat unique film ""The Autopsy Of Jane Doe"". The film follows a father and son who work together in a morgue, after the body of an unidentified young woman is dropped off the pair begin an autopsy on her, but from the second they cut into her they start to discover strange things about the body and strange events start to occur. The premise is definitely interesting, I was hooked right off the bat, I wanted to find out more about the body and the film did a good job of revealing things slowly to increase the tension. I also liked the characters, it's rare that you see a father & son as the leads in a horror film, it worked well and added some emotion to the film. Unfortunately though the film never really does much with it's story or characters. The set up is quite good and the tensity of gets fairly high, but then things kind of just start to fizzle out mid way through, at this point the film is still entertaining but it just started to feel like another cliché ridden horror flick. ""The Autopsy Of Jane Doe"" had a lot going for it, a good quality cast, a fresh concept, and what looked like a decent budget since nothing ever appeared cheap or poorly done in the film. But for me it failed to deliver a big enough pay off in the second act, which really hurt the film overall. Had the potential to be a gem in my opinion, but just missed the mark. Still an entertaining horror film that is worth you time though, should please most horror fans.6/10",neutral,movie
93010,"It should be absolutely awful. Who really wants to see a filmed version of the masturbational journals of an idiot like Chuck Barris? Actually, I'd forgive him for The Gong Show and the $1.98 Beauty Show. I've seen them both, and they're somewhat entertaining. I couldn't forgive him for writing such a pointless book as Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. So it is an enormous credit to George Clooney, making his directorial debut, that he keeps this film as good as it is throughout its entire run. I can't believe Charlie Kaufman could have written this alongside Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. It's a junky script desperately groping for profundity and/or sympathy for its lame central character. There are only a few moments of worthwhile humor. I especially like the annoying Dating Game contestant who wants Chuck to make the girl like him more. The acting is pretty good, too. Drew Barrymore, whom I don't care too much for, gives one of her best performances. I also liked Clooney himself, in an emotionless role that works well for him. Julia Roberts makes a nice visual impression, but the script didn't provide her character with any interest whatsoever. The cinematography is very beautiful, as well. But, like I said, the film belongs to Clooney and his stylish direction. Clooney often gets a bad rap for his acting, and, a lot of the time, I have to agree. So maybe he'll continue along this line and, with a better script, make a great film. 6/10.",neutral,movie

I consider 'The Road' as a much, much stronger example of a film that blends horror and psychological drama - in exploring the limits of humanity & family in an apocalyptic setting.It's nonetheless a well-made film with fine performances, but I came into the film expecting...something great, which it wasn't.

93105,"With the exception of ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Glory,"" respectively, I've never found either Julia Roberts' or Denzil Washington's work to be among my favorites. Their performances in this movie did nothing, for me, to change this opinion. Hers was just overall annoying, and his so low-key and quiet I wish someone (either on-screen or off-) had had a cattle prod handy to rouse him.I like Grisham's work overall, and have liked some of the screen presentations as well as, or even better, than the book. This one definitely wasn't one of them. For me, a major problem was not caring an iota for ANY of the characters (lead or minor, good-guy of bad- in the supporting cast).But seeing it again at this time in our history, viewing Robert Culp's thoroughly-inept,, unintelligent, vacuous President {(ring any bells????), and his devious aide, Tony Goldwyn, (ring the bell again?)} - and all of the completely smarmy government operatives abounding - well, it seems that our current reality is imitating art.The present goings-on, and the past several years with the Iraq fiasco, may have a different scenario than this flick, but the current cast of real characters in D.

93256,"Let me start by saying i love Spaced and Shaun of the Dead, both of which i've seen many many times on DVD (even got Spaced signed by the cast and Edgar) so you can understand my excitement on watching Hot Fuzz.Now i'm home after watching at the cinema both my wife and i thought it was alright. Nothing more. Don't get me wrong, i can think of worse ways of spending 2 hours but it just didn't feel as _sharp_ as shaun.The best thing about Shaun is it's multi-layered. You can watch it again and again and spot things you missed the first time around. It credits you with a brain and lets you work things out for yourself. Hot Fuzz feels the need to help you along by using constant ghost voice overs reminding you of specific dialogue at salient points.I think i was just expecting more from it, i was waiting to see slow-mo shoot outs in the village hall, fast cutting one-on-one shoot outs. Walking away from explosions with shotguns over their shoulder. There seemed to be none of that.Although there were laughs, they weren't belly laughs. Anyone who watched Shaun will remember them bashing a zombie with pool cues in time to 'Don't Stop Me Know' will smile to themselves. It was more humorous with a couple of in jokes to older Wright-Pegg material. I don't think i actually laughed loudly once during the whole movie.It also seemed to be for a larger audience. Shaun was cult through and through. It paid homage to so many zombie movies it was hard to keep count and some of them were so subtle it was hard to spot without multiple viewings (Foree Electronics anyone?). Hot Fuzz seemed more generic and tried to be a movie in itself rather than paying homage to anything specific, although i did spot the Lethal Weapon reference quite clearly.So there we have it, it was amusing, but not funny. There was action, but you have to wait a while for it. And some of the characters seemed to be there just for the sake of getting someone famous in.

93279,"Fury has one of those ""the only good morality in wartime is no morality"" themes. I admired the sound effects in the battle scenes. They'll probably win an award for those. But I hated the script and the dialog and gave up on it altogether after about 40 minutes. It lacks class. It is in many ways the opposite of Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, which were about redemption through suffering and sacrifice under extreme duress. Fury was about degeneracy becoming the new righteousness. Ugly, and maybe even downright revisionist and historically inaccurate. Almost like a pornographic comic book version of history designed to appeal to adolescent boys raised on Game of Thrones episodes and Grand Theft Auto video games. As somome who actually spent a couple of years as a cavalry scout in the army, I can also say that the battle scenes lacked authenticity. Particularly in the amateurish way the troops talked to each other and moved during combat.

93318,"Being an optimistic fellow I wanted to enjoy The Godfather Part III the first time I saw it - this was easy, since its a competent piece of film making, generally well paced, acted, it's coherent, Al Pacino's in it, Coppola has made this film from A to Z and on its own terms the film doesn't have any inexcusable flaws. (Not even, I might add, the notorious Sofia Coppola; she's bad, but her performance is benefited by the character she's playing, which is also weak). So for a long time I was one of those guys going ""Hey, Godfather part III isn't as bad as everyone says. Sure, its not as good as the first two but not many movies are!"" Later in life, presumably with heightened standards and a better sense of criticism, I started to suspect that the opposite could be true - that part III was really nowhere near as good as I'd recall - and after seeing all three films pretty much back to back I have to be honest (an approach I think wouldn't hurt the more enthusiastic defenders of this film) and conclude that The Godfather Part III, despite certain qualities, simply doesn't work.(Excluded passage due to word limit; concerning how Coppola did the film for the money, and that it actually makes the film a little easier to appreciate)I think the film really, on a whole, is perhaps not 'bad', certainly not horrible, but definitely a failure. The plot is underdeveloped and not engaging - Michael Corleone suffers from guilt. Its not unreasonable to say he did that at the end of Part II already. Where does his search for redemption lead him? Do ""they"" really pull him in again? Does his character do or say anything really memorable? Once or twice. But the script really is a long filler-session. And while everybody seems to just automatically praise Pacino because, well, he's Pacino I don't think his performance in this film is particularly good either, at least not by his merits. He's a great actor, and this is as fine a performance as any other he's made, but when you consider how truly versatile Pacino can be (compare Godfather part II with Scarface, with Serpico, Devil's Advocate, you name it, he's right there in character) its a disappointment that the aged Michael Corleone has turned into... well, Al Pacino. Obviously the character is not the same man that he used to be, but I never once really believed that I was watching Michael Corleone. He looked, and acted, too much like Al Pacino.Not to mention Andy Garcia being nothing more than Andy Garcia, Joe Pantanglio, Eli Wallach, Talia Shire in a strangely awful performance (she's not a bad actress at all, but whatever happened here?). And of course Sofia Coppola; she isn't the crucial problem, but in the end she does become responsible for a lot of misfiring. The only one still doing a prime job is Diane Keaton as Kay - truly an unsung hero in these films, and to me one of the main reasons the drama work - and the film's best scenes were the one's she shared with Pacino. Why? Because then I felt like I was even watching a Godfather movie.Much of everything else simply doesn't work. Whereas the original films were subtle and ambiguous, part III filters the story with melodramatic punches that are un-inspired and obvious. Michael's son, played by Franc D'Ambrosio, seems taken from Days of Our Lives and so many of the questions we ask ourselves - what does he remember from his childhood? What does any of the characters feel about Michael's marriage in Sicily? Did Tom Hagen ever move to Las Vegas? etc - are left completely by the road, as if Coppola truly isn't interested in telling this story. There are instead near-insulting reminders to the audience that the other two movies still exist (like the pointless scene where Michael have kept the drawing Anthony left at his pillow when he was nine or so; ""I remember this"" he smiles, though I'm not sure if we are to understand this as ""I also remember they shot up the bedroom that same night""; once again, it seems Coppola simply forgets his own story). There are also awkward attempts at creating dramatic highlights in line with the horse-head scene and that very shooting in the beginning of Part II, involving a shooting during a parade in Little Italy and a stupid and ugly scene involving a helicopter. Making a Godfather sequel formulaic is truly a depressing insult to the originality of the first two films. The attempts Coppola takes on the Vatican are also pretty flat when you think about how Italian cinema has been doing this for half a century.There's no reason to watch this film have you not seen the first two. And there's really no reason to watch it if you have seen them either. When you think about it, I don't see why the film's few merits are worth talking about. Movie newbies having seen Part I and II will naturally see III too, and I think many of them will come to the same conclusion. It's not all bad, but so what. It simply doesn't work very well.",neutral,movie

The acting is superb throughout, and the nuanced performances of Amy Adams & Jake Gyllenhaal are worthy of their reputations. The subtle transitions from dead and lifeless to young and vibrant, exhibited by the former at various stages of the film, is one of the most striking features of the piece. The film is beautifully shot and well directed, and there are some truly moving scenes in parts. However, as one reviewer has already alluded to, the film feels like it is desperate to say something, but ultimately says very little. Perhaps i just didn't get it at all.The problem i had was with a lack of emotional connection to either of the main protagonists. It's interesting to find out what happens to both as the film builds, but ultimately i didn't care either way.My partner and i spent some time examining the film on the way home, discussing the parallels between the story at the heart of the film, and the realities that continue around it, but despite our rudimentary analysis of what each one meant for the other, and an understanding that there are some clever parallels, what remained was the underlying sense of ""so what?"".",neutral,movie

93619,"""Full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing"" could be a summary of this modern-age disaster movie. In 2010 the ""Deepwater Horizon"" drilling rig off the coast of Louisiana failed in spectacular fashion, bursting into flames and spewing millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico in what was the worst oil-spill in American history. Mark Wahlberg plays the well-respected electrical 'Mr fixit' Mike Williams on the rig, reporting to the Operations Manager Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell). The exploratory project is way-behind and BP are not happy. Big-wigs from the company add support to Donald Vidrine, the BP site leader, in applying mounting pressure on Harrell to press on regardless without all the necessary and time-consuming tests by Schlumberger being completed. Rogue numbers in further tests are waved away as 'glitches'. A familiar story of corporate greed and pressure overriding the expert's better judgment.When disaster strikes it strikes quickly, with some spectacular and exciting special effects that leave the audience especially hot under the collar. Female support is provided by the comely Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez), given the almost impossible job of keeping the floating bomb on station as chaos reigns about her. As an audience we are back on familiar ground here from classic Irwin Allen disaster movies such as ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure"". Who will make it, and who won't?A more telling question here is ""Do we care?"" and unfortunately for the film, the answer is ""Not really"". This feels a callous thing to say when this was a real and recent event and eleven people and – as touchingly illustrated at the end of the film in tribute – many of them family men with young kids, never went home again. But film-wise, we only really get bought into the fate of Williams, whose back-story, with cute wife (Kate Hudson) and cute daughter (Stella Allen) we get to meet and sympathize with. We get a minimalist view of Fleytas's backstory, but only enough to provide a recurring ""Mustang"" reference. And that's it. All the other characters are just two-dimensional ""rig crew"": cannon-fodder for the special effects team. The screenplay by Matthew Sand and Matthew Carnahan really doesn't deliver enough heft to get us bought in.While the special effects are good, the sound design isn't, with much of the dialogue being incomprehensible.All the acting is fine, with the ever-watchable John Malkovich nicely portraying the corporate head you love to hate. Wahlberg as well delivers enough range to make you forget in this ""action mode"" that he was also in ""Ted"". And Rodriguez as a junior lead holds her own against the big guns in what is a creditable performance in a big film role for her. While ""Lone Survivor""/""Battleship"" director Peter Berg neatly provides an insight into life on and around rigs, and (via subtitles) descriptions of the drilling process which I found interesting, this comes down to the sum of a tense build up, an hour of frenetic disaster, and then a whimper of an ending. Where were some of the dramatic scenes of conflict in the congressional hearing that the film's opening implies might come? Where are the scenes of ecological disaster and local financial ruin to add emotional angles to the story? None of this is really exploited and the whole concoction comes across a bit ""meh"" as a result. Not a bad film by any means. But not one I will remember in a month or two's time.(Agree? Disagree?

93678,"As a certain character once said, a James Bond movie is only as good as the villain. The same rule actually applies to just about any story with some kind of confrontation, with the best of such stories having villains which you even want to relate to.Kung Fu Panda trilogy is no exception. One of the reasons behind the first film's excellence was Tai Lung, a character so intense, conflicted and deeply rooted in the history of the KFP universe, that his story managed to combine the vibes of two great confrontations: Obi-Wan vs Darth Vader and Darth Vader vs Luke. So it's no wonder that my greatest wish for every next KFP movie was to have him back somehow. Those vain hopes...The villain's complexity became the foundation on which the rest of the story could develop. Including the main character. First film's Po was so great because he was a classic ""loser with a dream"" type of character: confined in his bleak reality but refusing to accept his destiny. Po's power was in finally letting himself pursue the dream he's been having on his own for so long, and in how a true dream can overcome any obstacle in its way.The problems began when Po was raised to the supreme position. It's where the pursuit of a dream was replaced with a job. Po is not a leader, he's not even a hero, he's just a guy who does what he can because his heart tells him so. But letting him keep that spirit would mean losing pace for the franchise. So each next film was basically creating a new villain out of thin air (or, in this film's case, from the other world, literally) and imposing the duty of defeating him on Po, using it as a justification for granting him another magic ability.The gods are what we create ourselves. And, at the end of the day, KFP3 finished creating a cult of the Dragon Warrior by transforming Po from a goofus with a heart and spirit into some kind of omnipotent golden Buddha, smiling and just-be-yourself-preaching. The complexity is gone, the humanity, with all its inherent flaws, is gone. The only thing that's left is the divine perfection and invulnerability. Maybe the kids will love such glossy happy ending, just like they love playing video games in god mode: easy win, plain and simple.

While the b/w cinematography is excellent and the zombies look quite convincing, the ""nervous"" editing style often looks clumsy and inept.2) There are some huge lulls. All those radio and TV bulletins, which are supposed to be ""enlightening"" and explain what's going on, actually interrupt the action boringly. Watching the heroes watching TV for about 10 minutes isn't that interesting.There are some chilling moments in this film, and the pessimistic finale is ironic and brilliant, but the film as a whole just isn't as effective as it (probably) was during its first release. Another person here mentioned that it's also kind of a homage to ""The Birds"". I agree, but even with a higher budget, this film would still be far inferior to that amazing Hitchcock classic.",neutral,movie
93795,"Just because the movie is good looking and directed by one of the best movie directors of all time doesn't automatically mean that the movie itself is good as well. ""Empire of the Sun"" has a slow story that isn't always told from the right perspective.Really the biggest problem of the movie is the perspective it is told from. The entire movie is told through the eyes of a child played by a young Christian Bale. Sure, Christian Bale is a great actor and he now is Batman and all, so people will only love him more in this movie now but that doesn't all mean that Christian Bale as a kid was good and strong enough to carry an entire movie on his own. And this movie is really about Christian Bale's character alone. There is nothing wrong with telling a story through the eyes of a child and it can work really powerful but a movie like that also needs a good supporting adult cast to give the movie more credibility and give the movie some more characters to relate with. The movie does has a great supporting cast (John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, Joe Pantoliano and a young and 'serious' Ben Stiller in an early role.) but none of these actors are used consistent enough in the movie, with as a result that Christian Bale has to carry the entire movie on its own.Visually the movie is really spectacular to look at. The cinematography by Allen Daviau is magnificent and there are some well directed and good looking sequences in the movie. Also lets please not forget the brilliant musical score by John Williams that makes some of the sequences work extremely well and gives the movie some extra boost and power.The movie is not always correctly paced and there are some death moments in the movie were nothing really interesting ever happens. The movie does concentrate well on the emotions and feelings of especially the young boy Jim/Jamie but that doesn't always make the movie interesting to watch. It has never really been a movie that I particularly enjoyed watching, because of the at times low pace and narrow minded and very one-person sided perspective the movie is told from.In its emotions and dramatic moments, the movie really goes over-the-top at times. The movie can be seen as an over-dramatized one that doesn't always is believable in its story. There is some typical and predictable Spielberg sentimental stuff in the movie. The over-the-top level of this movie does provide the movie with some wonderful and unforgettable sequences but at the same time its a killer for the story and the movie its credibility.Yes the movie is perfectly watchable and its beautiful looking and all but the story and perspective makes this not really a movie that I like to watch. One of Spielberg's lesser movies. I'm sure that the book is great though! But the story doesn't really work in a movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",neutral,movie

93849,"Tonight there was a free preview screening at the Jerusalem Cinematheque, as a part of a children's foundation benefit. I think I'm the first to vote and comment on it, and I honestly wish I could give this film any more but six.Unfortunately, and despite the big production, the film is full of clichés and stereotypes, I was wondering how actors could get through this dialog with a straight face. True, a few cross-cultural references, such as ""Run, August, run"" make you laugh, but mostly I found myself laughing at how predictable - and unrealistic! - some scenes were.Knowing a thing or two about music myself, I can say that if this is what they want you to believe about what a musical prodigy, who never read notes or picked an instrument, can achieve in one day, then the authors' notions about love and relationships are as believable, or worse.Not recommended to any Robin Williams fans out there either. He plays a mean Fagin-like bastard of a character, which is probably a stretch any actor would love, but not such a great pleasure to watch, especially given his earlier filmography. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is b-e-a-utiful though, a cross between young Malcolm McDowell and, say, Johnny Depp. His upper lip alone is worth enduring most of the movie's clichéd messages :) Yes, and I loved the gospel band (do Harlem churches have real organs though? I don't think so).",neutral,movie
93897,"Paddington (the film) is a kids' adventure movie -- think Indiana Jones with fur. That doesn't make it a bad movie; in some ways it's very good indeed. The bear animation is staggeringly convincing, in fact. The story is witty and good-natured, and there are many funny moments.The problem for me is that it's just not Paddington. The Paddington stories that were such a feature of my childhood, and which I read to my own children, were more than just good -- they were inspired. Paddington never does very much in the books -- he certainly doesn't run around being shot at or scaling tall buildings. He just exists to throw the latent humour in everyday situations into sharp relief. The Paddington books were that rarest of literary achievements -- stories for children that were capable of amusing and entertaining their parents as well.I rather suspect that the original Paddington would be difficult to portray in a movie, because the humour is just too understated. To be fair this movie captures at least some of the original charm and colour of the stories; but it loses the subtlety.Sadly, I probably would have given Paddington a higher score if it had not been called Paddington; if, in fact, it had been about a different bear altogether. Or a gopher, or an ocelot, or a moose. Not a dog -- there are altogether too many talking-dog movies. Unfortunately, the literary Paddington has big shoes (or wellington boots), which the movie representation does not really fill.",neutral,movie
94043,"Let's get things straight: this is by no means a bad musical. There are some wonderful numbers- ""Make Em' Laugh"", ""Good Morning"", that one where the gal with the long leg dangles a hat in front of Gene Kelly- but the film itself is disappointing. I've always found Gene Kelly too arrogant and annoying to want to watch him as a romantic lead, a bit too uptight to be comic and his dancing's better in An American in Paris. Debbie Reynolds is cute but not earth-shattering. Donald O'Connor is fabulous- he's the reason to watch this film. His talent, particularly for comedy, exceeds Kelly's talents. He's definitely underrated.I was told that the whole spoofing of the advent of the talkies was hilarious. It's mildly amusing at best. The characters didn't really grab me either. It's a total myth that the story of a musical can get away with being complete fluff. Even if the story's a bit of a stretch (or a lot if it's Brigadoon), it should at least be entertaining. This film really ought to have simply been a revue.I think that nostalgia and hype may have clouded the judgement of quite a few viewers.",neutral,movie
94124,"I've been watching anime since I was a kid, so I've seen plenty of different genres, and different stories. To have people put this on a 9+ rating is extremely overestimated. If I was to say why there is so much hype about One Punch Man simply it's the animation and the music that goes along with the fight scenes. As purely an action anime I would definitely recommend it, however the story is rather mediocre.Just a basic summary is you have an over powered hero who pretty much finishes every enemy with one punch, as the title says. I figured it would be pretty boring, but it was rather enjoyable at first, but eventually it lost its charm quickly. The fight scenes were still gorgeously animated but you already knew who was going to win the fight. It just adds such irrelevance to all the other characters, who lack character development pretty much completely.A lot of the anime lately has been trashy, and although this was one of the better ones of the year, it by no means deserves all the praise it's garnering, which is mostly likely due to the appeal it also has to the western audiences. To have this rated higher than shows like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, as well as other anime's that exceed in several areas that this anime has completely fell flat on just doesn't make sense. Honestly don't get caught up in all the buzz, if you just want to watch an action show with a bland plot, by all means, it's at least worth watching if you have the time, but there are a lot of better shows out there.",neutral,movie
94149,"This ""classic"" movie, starring Clark Gable, and Claudette Colbert and directed by Frank Capra, doesn't REALLY stand up the test of time very well. Although it was the first movie to sweep the Academy awards, taking home Actor, Actress, Director and Picture, when seen today, it's almost nothing more then a light 30's comedy surely to be put on the lower tier of Academy Award best picture winners. Oh sure, the Gable and Colbert team are great, chemistry going right and left, and maybe they earned their Oscars. But best picture? To be honest with you, the only reason it became so massively popular, is because this was what the USA needed during the years of the Great Depression, a riotous comedy that people could escape to forget their troubles. Much like the ridiculous 'Yankee Doodle Dandy', this was the right picture at the right time, (and uh, the right influential director) to take home the big prize. Did I like it?

94206,"I think Tom Hiddleston good as Jonathan Pine, but have found the series, up to now, overblown in contrast to the restrained adaptations of John LeCarre's works. They belong to a different time & possess faults of their own: 'Tinker Tailor...' was excellent, rooted in character & gripping whereas I felt 'Smiley's People' dragged on (recently shown on BBC4).This is a modern take on Le Carre, the basic tenets of the story are gripping (corruption/an arms dealer & inter-departmental counter plots at secret service level), but the romance elements are melodramatic & it all has the feel of a sub-par James Bond. This is a shame as it deals with an interesting subject & is probably based in truth & reality. How do corrupt regimes acquire weapons? Surely via some intermediary like a Roper.Is it unmissable or as the BBC loudly states about its iplayer service, 'Making the Unmissable Missable?' Well, I decided to turn over & watch the BBC4 showing of a film instead shown at the same time.Edit There seem to be an awful lot of sheep out there.Last paragraph from 'The Guardian':'How Plausible is John Le Carre's The Night Manager?'""Yet Pine, helped by Roper's girlfriend, Jed, is bringing Le Carré and Ian Fleming closer together, however much the incomparable inventor of George Smiley might not like it.

94241,"Netflix offers us a beautifully produced and visually pleasing historical drama. Although historically inaccurate in some parts, thus making Marco Polo a medieval fantasy of sorts, the drama, war, assassinations and political intrigue and characters are interesting enough to make this worth your time.However, the series suffers a bit from the wooden acting and stunted dialogue. The actor chosen for the role of Marco Polo is not quiet up to the task. The dialogue in some scenes feels more read from a script than spoken with conviction and emotion.After watching seven episodes, I feel it is good enough to watch the full season with some interest. Renewing the medieval genre with a Chinese focus is proving a difficult task for Netflix. But with better scripting and improved pacing of the story, Marco Polo may still prove a success. 6/10 ( acting 4/10', story 5/10, production 8/10, visual impact 8/10)",neutral,movie

Was the absence of previews for the next episode a sign of closure? Did I miss something? Did I miss a whole bunch of somethings? Did they run out of money and have to wrap up this sloppy mess as a result. Did the leading man die and they had to make do with what they had shot? Did the writers succumb to multiple writer's block? Was all this just the teaser for the sequel? I am really mystified.

94597,"Jon and Ygritte are the highlight of the episode, keep your eyes on them! There's also a piece of history that is revealed from their dialog that adds weight to their mission. I even liked the scene between Robb and Jeyne. The love scenes in this season as a whole are done particularly well actually. This is probably to compensate for dulling our senses with all the gratuitous yet equally unnecessary sex/extreme violence scenes that are all over the place in this show. Unfortunately these are present in this episode as well, but at least they don't go the full way (which I was afraid they would at one point, unsurprisingly involving Theon).The evolution of Brienne and Jaime are a delight to watch... at least they were in the beginning, but by the end of it I felt some writers forgot about these characters entirely and had to come up with lines for them just before the actors went on cameras. There is also a near escape sequence that was done particularly poorly, bearing witness to the show's budget constraints and human retardation. 'How could a man with only 1 hand climb that?' - I found myself asking. 'Damn with the limitations of human nature and physics!' - said every Hollywood director that ever lived, ever!!Bronn's character - damn, that guy likes reminding us that he's a good actor. The banter between him and Tyrion is fun, as usual, while the little man has some tough decisions ahead of him, judging from what they set up for him this far. Let's hope those end up being executed well.Sansa is still hanging around with Margaery; I guess some things never change. Bran, Hodor, the Reed brothers and that wild-ling lady (I always forget her name) are still heading North, but suffice to say is they're probably not going to meet any familiar faces anytime soon. Arya is still mad on the Brotherhood. Melisandre is still weird as... the night sky would be with two moons? No complaints there. Sam and his new friend with the baby are completely absent in this episode bo-hoo.Daenarys is fierce as ever and those dragon, ho-boy. They know how to portray their dragons in this show! She's kind of reached a halt, at this grand-city called Yunkai, that was build on the back of many, many slaves and well... she's a bit unhappy about that. I'm curious to see just how much she gets held back by this new challenge :DSadly there was no scene featuring Cersei, either. So where do we get our dose of barely contained rage, by a thin shell of cynicism you wonder? Look no further than Tywin's scene with Joffrey. It's always nice to see two badass blondes - each in their own way - duke it out for the best.So, what is my final take on this episode: sub-par. I was left at the end with a taste of bitter bile in my mouth and that wasn't due to the coffee I had while watching it. You see, even though I praised individual scenes, the sum of its parts is not greater than the whole, surprisingly. The motivation behind the characters seem a bit shallow, probably because they are so many at this point and so far apart from each other... It's like all the major characters' strengths rely on one- another, but as soon as they have an individual scene to perform, they act bewildered. And you know which are the main characters of the show I'm talking about: they are all the surviving ones, from the 1st season with few additions. Also, it's like they are not given enough care from the directors and the producers involved, like their personal journey and evolution does not matter, unless it involves another sex/extreme violence scene. Well, I CARE about these characters' evolution arcs and I WANT to see them being well-portrayed damit!The set-pieces are great - GoT crew! - and the amount of detail are charming to the eye, but... look, if this show wasn't sourcing Martin's masterpiece material, I would not be watching this. The 1st season was great and I can find absolutely no criticism: it was raw and powerful. With the 2nd and 3rd season, I feel like I am forced to watch the limitations of the productions's team, botching big action scenes and generally showcasing an unfocused view of their product. If you want to sell this to me AGAIN then you will have to figure out a direction for the story and not just do stuff 'because George Martin said so'. Books don't work the same as stories meant for the screens.

In particular, I really dislike its application of its musical score. Hey, I *like* Benny Goodman! But must his music virtually drown out the speaking voices? Musical score should enhance, not drown out, the narration or other dramatic text. Also, I find many of the musical choices to be incongruous with the on-screen action. My wife got up and walked out of the TV room at one point, completely annoyed with the overbearing, shrill score that distracted, rather than enhanced, the experience.

The plot is functional, and having someone with a less than scientific connection and more of a psychic one as a part of the scientific investigation is a plus. Said psychic connection is Cynthia Cline, who is pretty, the kind of pretty that you would feel comfortable taking home to Mom. This is, bluntly, just another one of those so so movies.

One of the better elements of this one is the enjoyable setup that manages to strand everybody together. With the activists who steal the animal and are rightfully attacked by the creature when they stop to release it and forcing the scientists to go looking for it, this one works nicely enough to get the animal loose into the world. Going alongside this is a fine storyline involving the friends working for their movie shoot which gets them out into the wilderness as well, giving this one some solid and really enjoyable main setup for the film. As well, the film scores incredibly well with action and practical effects. By using a practical rodent suit and head for the majority of the attacks, there's a fantastically cheesy charm to these scenes seeing the creature crawling over the victim ripping them to pieces in exceptionally brutal manners. The completely practical and cheesy gore here manages to allow this one plenty of short, vicious confrontations which carry out in various locations around the woods and into a frenzied battle through the beats' underground lair that packs in tons of action alongside the bounty of bloodshed on display. These here are what hold this one up while there are some flaws to be had here. The main issue is the continuous ability to shift focus away from the main story to draw in random characters simply to get more of a body-count on-screen. The film stops dealing with the characters shooting the movie or the scientists tracking the creature to focus on a random character having a graphic and brutal encounter with it, creating a wavering tempo throughout here as it zips around to something else at random intervals. That also factors into the idea of a weak storyline here by focusing on unrelated encounters for a major part of the running time. The other big flaw here is the rather cheap look throughout here that does pick up from time-to-time. The fact that the entire time the creature has a strange series of marks across the creatures' face that never moves or changes makes it look inherently fake, especially with the obvious puppet arms and suit-work for the creature making for a cheesy feel at times. However, it's the over-the-top blood-splatter that gets the most attention here because it's red-colored water erupting from a hose splashing over everything which is so far from realistic behavior that it is distracting and jarring in quite extreme measures due to the number of attacks in that matter. It's the biggest issue holding this one back.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language, Nudity and drug use.",neutral,movie

It was a decent surprise.Was nice to see Felissa Rose in a film with a decent budget again (although her part here was beyond limited).The visuals would be the main factor in recommending this flick. The atmosphere is moody and surreal, and the sets interesting enough to keep your attention.I guess my main problem with this film, and so many like it, is the fact that it drips with pretension. Too often filmmakers (usually on the independent scene) confuse a pretext with a story, and try to force their point of view through visuals instead of coherency.

A full-blast, pitch-black, living-dead, gore-fest, which, unlike most modern exploitation, will leave gorehounds completely satisfied. Yeah, it was shot on video, I know, it looks weird. Personally, I'm cool with it, but this s.o.v. badass will force nay sayers to overlook the obvious flaws like that as well as the $30 budget. Earth-shattering gore is one thing, but was the worm-vomiting really necessary? Oh yeah, it really, really was!! Alex has a rare bone disease, and pretty much, has no chance of living, he is looked after by his hot wife, Kristen, who is slowly losing hope. Eventually, Kristen seeks the help of Alex's friend, Thomas (the director), to help find a cure. Thomas's cure, you ask? Why, bones of course, yeah, bones of the dead will now be fed to the sickly Alex. You see, Thomas works in a morgue, so stuff like that is simple for good ol' Tom. Whatever you need, as long as dead bodies are involved. What's funny is that this bone-marrow medication is actually starting to work, yay for Alex!! What's not so funny is that the dead do not appreciate people stealing their bones, and they're just about ready to rise up and kill everybody in a really gory manner, apparently because they're all sore at Thomas. Actually that's pretty funny too.We certainly have a doozy on our hands here, don't we? The truth is, if any gore film has ever even remotely given Peter Jackson's Dead Alive a run for its money, well gang, here it is. Not only that, but Bone Sickness, aside from the gore, can actually be kind of interesting, and I know, why listen to me when there's already so many other negative reviews for this? All I can say is that those people are liars, and that they're all probably jealous because none of them could ever shoot something this awesome on video, or I don't know, they probably just don't dig stuff that was shot on video. But really, Bone Sickness is at least as good as Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence, or at least a Todd Sheets film. If gory, living-dead epics with a hopeless vibe is your cup of tea, Burial Ground is also a must see. For something else from Brian Paulin, the maniac who directed this atrocity, check out Fetus.

95510,"If you were to read my review of Killjoy, you would see that I clearly loathed that film.I heard the sequel was in production, and was extremely leery.  Charles Band has made probably some of the worst movies over the last 6 years, since Full Moon separation from Paramount, Killjoy was one of them.  So, Killjoy 2 goes into production...Okay, I'm a sucker for sequels...I'll check it out!Well, then I heard that one of my new favorite actresses, Debbie Rochon, would be staring, and after her superb role in Witchouse 3...I was willing to give it a try.  I mean, J.R. Bookwalter executive producing, Tempe Entertainment had a hand in the production, first time director,  Tammi Sutton, who has done many things or Full Moon and Tempe.  Douglas Snauffer, writer of Witchouse 2 was writing this one...I was much more comfortable going into this sequel.Okay, the opening scene...I have a feeling it was intentional that it played like a really bad episode of Cops...I can see that being dreamed up by J.R. Bookwalter...That seems to be his sense of humor (which love him or hate him for it...He is a genius Gurellia film maker).  So then we go into the ""Wild Bunch"" role call scene...We learn who all our characters are, and why they are being punished, and sent to this camp to restore a juvenile home.  The lovely Debbie Rochon...I just had to stick that in there...The lovely Debbie Rochon.  I hated the outfit she had to wear in this film--that hat!  Eck!  I under stand that was her character, though.The unusal horror movie cliches commence: Bad Ass black guys swear and make sexual jokes--all too often, The van breaks down, the cell phone doesn't work, we end up at a redneck womans home (Tammi Sutton), We have a conflict with the redneck woman...I mean the cast is all black except Lilly the redneck, Debbie Rochon, and Trent Haaga, the guy in the Killjoy costume. Soooo, we have a shot out, we stumble onto a Voodoo womans home (sporting, what looks like the same dress worn in Witchouse 2 and 3), and then Killjoy comes, killing happen, and then we have a happy ending...Regardless of all the cliches, corny and unbelieveable dialog, and silly predictable characters, The movie is much better than the first!
I really did not like the score...The music was not on key with the action, and seemed to change the mood of the film.  Trent Haaga was a much better Killjoy than Angel Vargas in the first.  However, I don't feel he was able to explore the character too much.  I loved the fact this movie was filmed mostly outdoors...there was alot of action, not the typical "" 6 kids trapped in a castle, or haunted house"" scenario that Full Moon has been good for lately.  Since Tempe has been helping produce for Full Moon, the films have been a little better!  I am hoping since Danny Draven and Darkwave films has taken over production, they will be the same...He has a good eye for directing and producing.Anyway, Killjoy 2 was far better than the first, but still not strong enough to be all that fantastic of a film.  It has strong elements, and much more going on than the first film, but it just wasn't tight enough to make it better than say, Witchouse 3 or Witchouse 2 for that matter!6.5 out of 10",neutral,movie

The doctor alien tries scientific experiments to bring life various monsters but results that their bad habits to emerge , including the werewolf Waldemar Daninsky (Jacinto Molina or Paul Naschy), Frankenstein's monster , the mummy Tao-Tet , and the vampire Count De Meirhoff . Meantime , a Police Inspector named Tobermann (Craig Hill) is investigating the strange deeds . While, Waldemar falls in love and the events get worse . This is a humdrum adaptation based on Universal monster movies from a story and screenplay by Paul Naschy or Jacinto Molina Alvarez . As always , Naschy repeats his classic role , here the third performance as Waldemar Daninsky, and the only one that the character was a supporting role , the fourth would be the successful ""Night of Walpurgis"" . It's a particular version from ¨House of Frankestein¨ in which a doctor tries scientific experiments to be born and cure various Universal monsters as Dracula(John Carradine) , hunchback (J.Carroll Naish) , werewolf called Larry Talbot(Lon Chaney) , monster Frankestein( Glen Strange) , among others . ¨Monstruos de terror¨ is an atmospheric , slick terror film , an amusing monsters mixture , creaky at times but it's still acceptable . Fim displays passable set design , ambitious screenplay with too many monsters and average interpretations of all casting . This is a pretty entertaining European horror movie though packs absurd situations and cheesy frames . US distributor Samuel M.Sherman chose ""The mark of the Wolfman"" for his pre-booked 'Frankenstein' title, passing on the opportunity to showcase this film, which actually features a 'Frankenstein' monster ; he also believed that this film's European distributor ripped off his Al Adamson title ""Dracula vs. Frankenstein."" Little budget film though produced by Jaime Prades who was associated to Samuel Bronston , both of them financing blockbusters as ¨El Cid¨ and ¨The fall of the Roman empire¨. ¨Monsters of terror¨ is an atmospheric as well as eerie movie that contains bemusing scenes when appear the various monsters and take place their confrontations each other in some ridiculously made scenes , including primitive special effects . The picture has numerous ""older technique"" FX such as transparency , ancient computers fulls of buttons and lights , matte paintings, blood similar to tomato , reverse-footage , excessive make-up ; all of them were made by FX expert Antonio Molina and make-up artist Ramon Ferrer . It's a slight fun with professional make-up , naive special effects , appropriate set decoration and functional art direction . You will watch it and think it is either awful , hilarious, a masterpiece, or all three . It's a simple entertainment with embarrassing images , naive special effects , campy production design and evocative setting . Although critics do not appreciate much this picture ; however has a kind of loopy , Ed Wood quality that must be endured to be totally considered . The fable is sometimes silly and laughable , though a few Naif effects and action are professionally made . Some illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the monsters appearance though some scenes are a little bit cheesy . Thrilling and frightening musical score by Franco Salinas . Colorful cinematography by Godofredo Pacheco , but being necessary an urgent remastering and filmed on location in Casa Campo, Madrid, San Martín Valdeiglesias, Madrid, Ermita San Frutos hermitage, Sepúlveda, Segovia and Munich, Bavaria, Germany . While not a hit during its original run, the film became a limited success when reissued many years later considered to be one of the best worst terror films of cinema history .

95965,"Joseph Langdon (John Ashley) is a traitorous, cowardly deviate running for his life in post WWII Philippines. He encounters Satan himself (prolific Filipino icon Vic Diaz), who promises that he will save Langdons' ass in exchange for becoming his disciple. Unfortunately, periodic transformations into a grotesque creature - and inevitable rampages of said creature - will be part of the bargain.If you've seen a lot of Filipino exploitation and genre cinema, you've seen the name of the writer / director often: Eddie Romero. Here Romero crafts a decent enough horror flick that manages to overcome the limitations of a (most likely) limited budget. It's certainly cheap looking, but it has much of the atmosphere common to Filipino horror of the 60s and 70s. Romeros' screenplay is also more interesting than the usual monster movie cranked out by the country during these decades. As you can see, it's got a touch of ""Faust"", combined with a werewolf tale and domestic drama, as Langdon / Philip Rogers tries to mend his relationship with his wife (sexy Mary Charlotte Wilcox). The effective music score is by Nestor Robles, the passable makeup effects by Tony Artieda.Ashley tries his best in a role more meaty (pardon the expression) than he usually played in these movies. Wilcox isn't that great, but is certainly pleasing to look at. Leopoldo Salcedo and Eddie Garcia (another guy who turned up frequently in these sorts of movies) are fine as investigating detectives, and Ken Metcalfe is alright as Rogers' brother Earl. Diaz has fun with the flashiest role in the picture (and has the best dialogue), but the best performance has to come from Andres Centenera (the warden in ""The Big Bird Cage""), who plays the helpful blind man.Fairly thoughtful, and reasonably entertaining, ""Beast of the Yellow Night"" has some good moments throughout.Six out of 10.",neutral,movie

96260,"Although the acting and character development in this film are very good, I was left at the end with too many unanswered questions and unexplained plot holes. It's always difficult to realistically display mental health disorders in a sympathetic and factual way and this title managed to cover such an emotive subject in a sensitive way, which was quite impressive. However, the storyline isn't a strong one and does little to explain who the characters really are, let alone how or why they make the choices they do. People are introduced and never explained, leaving you feeling that you have no idea where people have appeared from or what their motives are. I understand that sometimes as a viewer you have to 'Put the pieces of the puzzle together yourself' but it constantly seemed as if a lot of the pieces were missing and there was no way to see the whole picture. Overall, this movie was rather disappointing and missed the opportunity to create a great atmosphere as well as subjecting us to a rather strange and badly thought out narrative.",neutral,movie
96275,"Wing-cheong Law directed ""Iceman"" is a blended fantasy/sci-fi film that plays heavily on the classic Hong Kong action/fight set-up. The story takes on the cryogenic tech concept by having ancestors of almost godly stature and brings them to the 21st century in a light- hearted, cut-n-copy style that Hong Kong cinema is famous for. I love the theatrics of Asian cinema. Maybe it is because, due to subtitles, I place my focus on emotion, body language and facial reactions. I skim read the subtitled dialog-often times the translation is brutal.""Iceman"" has a fun, and yet intense story that begs for cool fight sequences choreographed flawlessly. I didn't totally get the grandeur that surrounds these figures-who obviously have mastered the teachings so well they have transcended into ""godhood"". However the scenes are so strong, with a balance of melodrama, humor and action. The story does capitalize on the expected components that make up modern action films from China, it almost mirrors the set up of Japanese anime series. The characters, although a bit cliché, offer a collection of comic relief, romantic interlude, and tons of dramatic inflection. All in a blended cultures piece that brings the past into the present. The special effects and sound in ""Iceman"" are standard blends of CGI heavy sequences and choreographed fight stuff. I have learned that Asian cinema is one area where tolerance of CGI is just mandated in order to get into films from this market. It is okay as long as enough practical effects are added to balance it out. Which in ""Iceman"" actually works to do just that. Everything about the various techniques used add to the melodrama and excitement. The soundtrack and sound effects are standard mill stuff so that was a bummer. Most was instrumental melodies that felt familiar. It works but it does real propel the story to that extra level of suspense or thrills. Overall ""Iceman"" is a decent action/fantasy film with plenty of fights and drama. I am not sure if it is truly a strong piece because some of the material didn't connect with me personally. I enjoyed watching this film but I have seen better films similar to this one come out of Hong Kong. Still the cinematography and production value is stellar. The flat areas for me are the humanizing scenes of character relationship/ dialog interaction moments that are intended to build up the characters so that they more personable dimension, but really just creates drag on the action and thrills a bit too much. Again – I liked ""Iceman"" but I am not sure if it will be strong enough for the die-hard Asian cinema fan.",neutral,movie

96354,"With a title like this and a trend of mindless slashers just burgeoning in the early 80s, one might think this film would have little to offer. I was mildly pleasantly surprised how fairly well-put together the film is. The story is not all that inventive about a loose murderer who having killed at a wedding now kills girls about to be married. The opening murder in the movie theater is one of the most effective scenes in the whole film as it sets the tone for the film and, with slasher film playing during murder, firmly plants tongue in cheek making fun of itself. I can respect any film doing that at the beginning. The story then sets up with one girl in particular being preyed upon by the killer shortly before she is intended to be married(isn't that death enough?)What sets this film apart from the many clones that follow and the shorter than you might suspect list of those filmed beforehand is that this film has some talent in it. Not great talent but talent nonetheless. Armand Mastroianni does an effective job behind the camera creating some pretty chilling scenes despite having virtually no budget. His approach to filming Tom Rolfing as the murderer was a good choice; have the killer lurking but rarely ever seen fully. His presence is felt through much of the film creating tension. Nice move. The director also was very good at pacing the action in the film. The actors are all decent(with the exception of a policeman working on the case prior to the new prey - Whew! he is bad). A very young, unknown Tom Hanks has a small role, and one can see some obvious talent in his unimportant role. One flaw in the direction might be the overuse of the eye close-up of virtually everyone in the film. I cannot remember seeing so many eyeballs so close, but some of these also help aid the suspense. A little goes a long way though. Again, not a great film but an entertaining one in the sub-genre of the slasher film. It is miles ahead in almost every regard over tripe like Friday the 13th.",neutral,movie

96377,"Steven Seagal returns to the screen in this story about a former black ops warrior who gets caught in between Russian and Chinese gangs in order to save the sister of his neighbor, whose brother is in debt to the Russian mob. Truth be told, while one could call this a Steven Seagal movie, his character occupies a position that simultaneously is and isn't the center of the story (much like his previous effort FORCE OF EXECUTION). However, unlike FORCE OF EXECUTION, the story is better, more thought out and has better action sequences. Even the acting is better this time around, which is a plus. Story-wise, Seagal plays a variation on the character he plays in almost every movie he makes: that of the reluctant hero. He puts himself into a self-imposed retirement after a terrorist hit goes wrong, and a young girl dies while one of the bad guys gets away. Cut to the present day, and he's living a quiet life in Eastern Europe. His neighbor (Iulia Verdes) works at a strip bar (but she's just a bartender) run by the Russian mob while her half-brother (Victor Webster) pays off a debt owed by his father. However, when some men are killed and money meant for the Chinese mob goes missing, the neighbor's little sister is kidnapped and Alexander (Seagal) goes back into action. I thought that the story, while nothing original at all, was at least executed rather well within the confines of what constitutes a Seagal movie. The performances were also decent for this type of movie, with Tzi Ma probably doing the best out of the cast. Also of note is the improved fight sequences, which aren't completely edited to hell this time. The camera-work still has a hand-held feel to it, but the action is more comprehensible than a lot of Seagal's recent DTV output and you can tell that it's him a lot more of the time. They also varied the types of fighting. Sure, they had the typical gunplay and close quarters hand-to-hand combat, but Seagal also got to use a short sword for several scenes which was a nice change of pace (and provided some gruesome kills). Still, as always it wasn't all great. This movie was filmed on the cheap in Romania and it shows in the bleak cinematography and sparse sets. There was also some digital augmentation in a few scenes that stuck out pretty badly, and a couple of obvious uses of stock footage that wasn't at the same quality as the movie itself. And while some might count this as a positive, there was a bunch of gratuitous nudity which was only in there because some scenes happened to take place in a bar. There's also an awkward ""sex"" scene with Steven Seagal and Iulia Verdes which could have been left out completely. When all is said and done, Seagal fans should be pleased, as this is a return to form of sorts, at least when limited to his DTV work. As always, though, everyone else should probably find something else to watch.",neutral,movie

96645,"""Badges of Fury"" is a short and fast paced action comedy movie which is certainly entertaining but overall disappointingly superficial. The movie has a clever marketing strategy and includes many cameos by famous Chinese stars which include not only actors but also sportsmen for example. The longest cameo includes Jet Li who appears from time to time in this movie but doesn't really play an important role as the trailers might suggest. Even when he's there, his acting is wooden and lifeless and this could be considered his worst movie ever and I'm saying this as a big fan who has watched almost all of his movies. The film is also a parody of several Hongkong blockbusters from the last thirty years. Some of the insinuations are funny, for example when the main characters coincidentally capture a fashion icon who is behind online piracy acts. Most jokes are though either silly in a very childish way when we get to hear weird cartoon noises during some action scenes and overacted reactions by some of the characters. These ridiculous noises that seem to be taken off some old Looney Tunes episodes are overused in the first half of the movie and get completely dropped in the second part. Other jokes are simply sexual innuendos as we get to see many close-ups of Liu Yan's big breasts which get a lot of attention from female and male characters throughout the entire film. In general, men are mostly portrayed as dumb and superficial machos while women are mostly portrayed as silly sexual objects. I'm someone who likes to laugh a lot and this includes dirty and slapstick humour but this kind of silly rehashed comedy is nothing but embarrassing.The action scenes are quite a mixed bag. Most of them are voluntarily exaggerated and feature massive CGI effects that kill any kind of charm that the parodied Hongkong classics have. Still, a few fighting scenes are well executed and filmed. They are filled with adrenaline and grace and use several interesting items as weapons. Even in his weakest movie, an elderly Jet Li can still show off his incredible talent and his acolyte Zhang Wen does a quite convincing job if one ignores the distracting slapstick moments during his fighting scenes. On the other side, the final fighting scene involving Jet Li is overlong and unspectacular.The plot of this movie is extremely odd. The film starts with three random slapstick murders where the victims all die with a strange smile on their faces. The main suspect of the movie is a shy actress with good manners in her late twenties who hasn't got her breakthrough yet and who was engaged to each victim over the past years. Her sister soon becomes another important suspect as the superficial beauty with bad manners stole each of her sister's fiancés and sold insurances to them that made her a wealthy woman when they died. The unpredictable final twist of the movie where a rabbit gets pulled out of a hat is though so absurd that it even feels misplaced in a slapstick comedy flick. In between the morbidly amusing opening and the forced twist followed by a stereotypical happy ending, a few more plot lines are introduced only to justify many pointless cameo appearances. None of the few potentially promising ideas such as the relationship between the two investigating officers or the meeting of the criminal gang at the beginning of the movie are pushed further. Any kind of character development is completely absent in this hollow movie.In the end, this movie is bearable because of a few gripping action scenes, a couple of acceptable jokes, a high number of cameos by famous actors and allusions to classics any Hongkong cinephile should know and the fact that one is impatiently waiting for the outcome of the story as the tension slightly increases even if the twist ends up being a huge letdown. Despite its obvious flaws, I was overall very well entertained by this dynamical movie for the reasons mentioned above. I would surely watch it again in a couple of years. Those who are mainly planning to watch this movie because they are expecting an explosive martial arts blockbuster with Jet Li should be careful though and rather rent the film for a reasonable price instead of buying it or going to the movies.",neutral,movie

That part of the movie is OK, and follows modern ghost movie traditions. But some bright bulb apparently decided to also make this a slasher film, with big boobs on display and lots of blood-letting for the JASON and FREDDY crowd. Th slasher segments all tie into the missing children plot, but they were absolutely unnecessary and damn near ruined the movie. We know who the masked killer is way too early, too. Ignore the cheesy slasher scenes, some of which look like they were filmed and inserted as an afterthought, and focus on the ghost plot. You will be rewarded. The ending is a dilly.",neutral,movie

Believing some kind of ravenous subterranean creature to be the cause of the disappearances, harbour patrolman Harry (David Huffman) and ex-girlfriend Catherine (Marianna Hill) begin looking for the beast's lair.The cleverest thing about this predictable early 80s monster movie is surely it's amusing, Jaws-inspired tag-line 'Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water - you can't get to it.'; but even though Blood Beach displays very little else in the way of originality, rarely rising above routine B-movie fodder, there's just about enough fun to be had with it to still make it worth your while.Huffman and Hill are forgettably bland, but the presence of seasoned character actors John Saxon and Burt Young more than compensate for the lacklustre leads, both guys giving enjoyable performances, Young as an uncouth copper from Chicago with zero tact, and Saxon as his tough but fair superior. Also worthy of mention is the lovely Lena Pousette, who shines as Marie, Harry's sexy blond air-hostess 'friend with benefits'.The film also features several well executed deaths scenes, victims swallowed up by the sand in convincing fashion, and there's some fun to be had with the gore, including a would-be rapist having his junk chewed off by the monster and a cascade of dismembered body parts tumbling onto the unfortunate Catherine. Blood Beach's jump scares are about as clichéd as they can get (eg. a screeching cat leaping into frame) but they are still effective. Sadly, the monster is only revealed in the film's closing moments, and isn't all that impressive, looking like a giant papier-mâché plant (quite how that thing burrows underground, I'll never know!).In an ending typical of 70s/80s monster movies, the creature is blown to pieces, but as the closing credits roll, new activity under the sand suggests that the horror isn't over yet (although a sequel has yet to surface).5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",neutral,movie

Action-Sequences are good. The Graphics, however, are tacky. Performance-Wise: Seagal is back at what he's been doing since years: Kicking Ass & being a Badass.

The soul of one of it's victims now haunts a painting and comments on the carnage the bed reeks. Weird enough for ya? Sloppy, cheap and very amateurish, the film is really hanging at the bottom rung of the budget/talent food chain. The acting is mostly nonexistent (except for the trapped soul, who is pretty good), the sound quality is rough and the picture is faded. Also, the editing needs some serious attention as the pacing for the film is all kinds of wrong.And yet, the film kept me watching all the way to the end. It wasn't the trashy 70's goods that held on to me (of which, there are actually very little), it was the controlled strangeness of the picture. Unlike many odd-concept/low-budget affairs, the film starts and stays weird, but keeps itself contained; it comes off more artistic than it does simply exploitive.Technical limitations aside, the movie is interesting, if not all that entertaining.

Chuck blows away all previous concepts of what it means to be an actor. Seriously I never felt as ""inside"" another character as I have for Chuck's character, Junior Detective Tiffany Neversmile.Tiffany, as portrayed by Mr. Norris, is a high school teen-aged Goth girl with an interest in criminal justice and who is studying a Mail-Order course in circumcison in order to become the world's first Mail-order mohel, and a goil mohel at that .She gets involved in the typical teen-age diamond smuggling scenario, and through her partnership with Detective Inspector/Asst. Bowling Coach Shlomoe ""The Tranny Granny"" Running Bear, not only brings the smugglers to justice, but also triumphs over her own pain, depression and fashion shortcomings.To make it easy for you, this film is a sort of synthesis of films like Mean Girls, The Hot Chick, Ghost World and Requiem for a Dream, with an added liberal dose of martial arts, transvestitism, Deth Metal and marionettes. The soundtrack and score are a wonderful collaboration between Faith Hill and Goblin.But it's Norris' performance as high-school Goth girl Tiffany Neversmile that elevates this far above the level of the usual teen-age melodrama. His legs, skinny, bird-like and thankfully shaven, promote the illusion that Chuck Norris is a little girl.

It lacks the character build up and (if it where possible)the budget the original had, Yet it brings new depths with it in the introduction of 3 new teens.I recently bought both The Gate I and II from an on-line auction and these are the original rental boxes and tapes which give you more feeling of the movie as it brings back the memories of watching them with your pals in the 80's and the shock and horror you felt when you first saw the monsters!Back then the budget of the movie and the acting did not matter, As teen-ages all you wanted to see was the blood, Guts and gore. Now looking back as a more mature horror movie buff, These movies still have a magical feeling to them even if they do not have the fear factor of way back yonder. I love the old horror movies of the 80's, They played such a big part in a lot of teenage lads and lasses lives and this supper little number should be shown the respect it deserves.In my view this movie just for the sake of the fun factor should be given an 8/10.

97511,"Let's start out by saying that I *do* recommend this movie as being worth watching on its own and definitely the best of the non-trilogy consisting of the original ""The Philadelphia Experiment"" (1984), this 1993 film, and the 2012 remake of the first film, also named ""The Philadelphia Experiment.""There are some fine ideas in the story, and its portrayal of a terrible alternate America fifty years after its conquest by Germany is feels fully credible, right down to the updated Nazi swastika, altered to be less harsh and more palatable to an American populace so huge that even after the surrender following the nuclear destruction of Washington, D.C., it would still have to be successfully subdued psychologically in order to complete the Nazi victory.But oh, it's painful how much *better* it could have been with a less wooden leading actor and fewer bad filmmaking decisions. Brad Johnson, replacing Michael Pare as David Herdig, the man who was propelled from 1943 to 1984 in the original movie and now, nine years later, is a father and widower, just isn't very good here, and with one exception -- a fast and very well-executed sudden eruption of gunfire when Herdig's fake ID tattoo fails to satisfy a security scan -- the action sequences are simply painful to watch. Add problems like an incredibly corny and ill-advised audio montage of lines from earlier in the movie during a pointlessly extended time-travel sequence and it feels like the movie was made by two different people whose visions for it were at war with each other, only one of whom knew how to make good movies.(As an aside: some people have complained that an important piece of the plot, a brief exchange between two German characters in 1943, was presented entirely *in* German with no English subtitles. I personally was okay with this, but I was watching the film with the closed-captioning on so I got to *see* the German words, and with that it wasn't that hard for me to figure out the gist what was being said. Without the CC though, I have to admit that I probably would have missed the important bit of information conveyed there.)",neutral,movie

The soon discover that the urban legend is becoming true.Looks all promising and maybe you have heard it all before but this could have been a great slasher. sadly it doesn't become what it could have been. It's very simple to explain why. It takes halfway into the flick before something really happens. And when it happens it isn't even gory or bloody. It's sad because this flick do had all elements to make it great. A good opening, some gratuitous nudity and a bunch of kids going to be killed. But it moves so slow and after a while you get the typical slasher clichés that it becomes rather predictable. For example, the diner were everybody is looking to the kids entering, the warning made by one of the town. The old lady at the diner. Due all those things it became a lame horror.

97740,"This late-80s Burt Reynolds vehicle, while fun at times, is very cliched and run-of-the-mill as a whole. All the basic police-themed action thriller elements are there. It's not without its moments though, and it is still entertaining, if you can forgive its obvious flaws.The tough but disgraced former cop seeking a purpose. The helpless hooker looking for help. The budding romance. The bad guys on their trail. Sound familiar? It should. It is, after all, the plot to pretty basically ANY 80s cop movie, with a few changed details. This film follows the formulas to a T. It even has the opening shootout in which a sting operation goes badly, and the cop is taken off the case. It has the loud and stubborn superior officer who chews out the good cop. It also has the obligatory climax in the villain's mansion. These are only a few of the cliches.It's also awkward sometimes, with some lulls in the story's pacing and some boring moments. I've seen this described as part comedy, basically an action comedy, but the only potentially funny moments come from Liza Minnelli, who is the most annoying thing about the film. But while the movie is obviously a cookie-cutter copy of so many other 80s action movies, it's still fun. Burt Reynolds is there, and even when he looks bored, he's still entertaining. The action is fun and the characters are interesting enough.The action sequences are pretty good, even if they are few and far between. There's a bloody opening shootout, a fine fight scene at a party, a car chase, and the final showdown, which is the film's highlight. The action isn't really plentiful, but it's well-directed and entertaining enough, and the climax, as I said, is pretty good.Overall, this isn't the greatest Burt Reynolds movie for sure, but it's fine, and you could do a lot worse.",neutral,movie

There are many flaws: the story is very thin, the psychology of childhood sufferings that create a personality like Hopper's is so basal it's embarrassing, the cheap coincidences (like the heli flying around while Gina escapes for the first time and the colleague driving his car to the right place while the kidnapping is at its deadly conclusion). And the editing, what an awful job they did... The good thing about this movie is the acting. Hopper always maintains a fair level, no matter how crappy a movie is.

But it being a Hong Kong movie was more than sufficient for me to opt to sit down, spending time to watch it, of course.""From Vegas to Macau"" was an enjoyable mixture of classic Hong Kong movies such as ""God of Gamblers"" and other such Hong Kong movies from the mid-1990s. And it actually worked out well enough in favor of the movie.Now, keep in mind that ""From Vegas to Macau"" is a movie that also incorporate some slapstick humor into the formula. Personally, I think it worked out well enough, because the movie wasn't really taking itself entirely serious. I was entertained by the added comedy element. But I doubt that this will sit well with everyone in the audience.The storyline was straight forward and easy to follow. Perhaps it was a bit too generic, because it felt like directors Jing Wong and Siu-Hung Chung were running on autopilot at times.I will say that this 2014 movie had a good cast ensemble, and anyone just slightly familiar with the Hong Kong cinema will be pleased to see the likes of Yun-Fat Chow, Nicholas Tse, Chapman To, Michael Wong and Shiu Hung Hui on the cast list. It was really nice to have Jin Zhang in the movie, and boy, I must admit that I am very impressed with his martial arts performance.While ""From Vegas to Macau"" was by no means a gemstone in the Hong Kong cinema, it proved to be entertaining enough for what it was, and for that, I am rating it a six out of ten stars.",neutral,movie

Apart from the two female leads, a lot of the other acting was not as good as it should have been, and especially a number of the supporting cast were quite wooden at times. Dhani's grandma was quite hammy at times, as were some of Rishab's work colleagues, and even Rishab himself was not as well played as I have seen Salman Khan before, in ""Mujhse Shaadi Karogi"" for example.

It makes the movie strangely morbidly funny. The guy is a looser, who can't even commit suicide right. It's comedy doesn't make its gore any less gory though, just more easy to handle.Its different approach of things makes this definitely a better and as well a more entertaining movie to watch.

98171,"In a number of forums I've seen this film mercilessly trashed, and I'm not quite sure why. Perhaps it's having Tsui Hark's name attached to it, thus giving people the wrong idea about the film as they go into it. While I don't think it's the best film ever made by any stretch of the imagination, Vampire Hunters does serve it's purpose. I was entertained thoroughly, startled a few times, laughed a few times, and spent a great deal of my viewing time in suspense. The one thing you can say about this film is that it's definitely not slow moving!While it does suffer from the lack of in depth characterization that seems to be the downfall of many martial arts films, in general I found the acting to be up to par -provided you watch the film subtitled as opposed to dubbed. The wooden voice acting of the English translators is highly reminiscent of the hilarious goofy bad dubbing of 70s martial arts flicks, and really detracts from the genuine scariness of the vampire scenes. And those vampires! Yikes! Spitting acidic gas, sucking your blood through the air, covered in maggots.... Truly makes ol' Bela seem like a puddytat! It's interesting to see the differences between Eastern and Western vampire mythos. The movie itself is beautifully and imaginatively lensed, the director of photography should be proud. The camera-work zooms and jumps during the right moments and steps back and slows down to take in grandeur. The fight scenes are excitingly filmed, and the effects are no worse than any other film I've seen lately. Not the best, but everything moves quickly enough that you don't really notice. All in all, I got what I wanted; escapist, exciting, engaging fun that made me forget about the rest of the world for an hour and a half. And after all, isn't that what a movie is supposed to be?

And it's not a knock when I say that the plot is simple:  Who (or what) got this small, Louisiana town all worked up after the body of a young female resident is discovered?  That's sheriff Janssen's mission.  We are introduced to a few suspects along the way; plus, a rekindled romance.

The longer cadaverous Beth walks amongst the living the more Zach realizes things are not quite right.Plaza and DeHaan are nuanced in their performances. Plaza slowly transforms on par with her character Beth's physical transformation into putrid detritus. DeHaan contributes with concerned subtle glances and side-eyes that at any moment his ex-girlfriend hunger for brains will kick in.Jeff Baena writes and directs this weird RomCom zombie movie. Life After Beth is the definition of quirky and unconventional. It is bizarre and aspects of it are well thought out. It somehow blurs the line between horror and romance – with the dialogue delightfully ambiguous enough to make audiences forget the subject matter: Zach: You don't wanna eat me right now? Beth: ZachStop, my parents! Baena's theme through out the film is that being a zombie does not change a person substantially. As the layers of flesh are biologically broken down, so do the humanity-driven walls we build up to reveal a rawer version of the person. (note: I realize this is way deeper than needs to be) In this case Beth becomes voraciously needy, emotionally turbulent and in desperate denial.Life After Beth is smart and surprisingly novel movie interpretation given the influx supply in the zombie movie section of video rentals. But it is half realized and under-formed in the parallels and juxtaposition between being in denial about being undead and being in a relationship that is no longer thriving.The concept of using zombie-dom as a mirror and metaphor to look into a romantic relationship is fascinating. It is not realized or explored to its full potential that should have been expanded upon.Life After Beth reminds us that together forever is a really long commitment when half of the relationship is a zombie.Read our reviews IN FULL at our website.",neutral,movie
98314,"A psychiatrist takes a team of people to a retreat with a mental health patient in order to help her. Part of the process is the conducting of a series of experiments which go terribly awry.An initial struggle for me was how can a doctor be allowed to take a vulnerable patient away and use as a guinea pig; the ease with which it occurred, caused certain moral thrash. As the story moves on, certain inexplicable incidents occur with seem to trouble the entire team.Of course these ""incidents"" have had to take place since this is after all a horror film. The events cause a certain split as the doctor in charge believes there is a naturalistic explanation behind it whilst some of the team hold the view that there is a transcendent reality beyond what we see, feel and understand.On the whole, it is an effective horror film as the story progresses with good pace, upping the intensity with the passing of time. It is held back by a rather sense of predictability due to a highly worked story/theme (night/dark/silence interrupted by a sudden noisy intervention) and a not very believable initiating incident (the taking of a patient away for experimentation).",neutral,movie

The pace is also quite good, but I suppose that's kind of a given when your movie clocks in at less than 90 minutes. Still, this plot really knows how to move forward when it needs to, this movie isn't boring for a second. Furthermore, there are some actual surprises in this film, which is the last thing you expect from a (relatively) low-budget Hollywood thriller. It's not like there are any Shyamalan-like twists or something, and the movie does get increasingly (and annoyingly) formulaic as the end gets nearer, but there's still some unexpected stuff thrown it for good measure.

98720,"The directing duo of Abbas-Mastan created Race back in 2008 that deals with the twists, turns, and double/triple crossings between two brothers Ranvir (Saif Ali Khan) and Rajiv (Akshaye Khanna), against an ostentatious backdrop that included the requisite flaunting of material wealth, horse racing, romance, and shady characters that included the likes of femme fatales in Bipasha Bashu and Katrina Kaif in one of her earlier Bollywood roles. The sequel boasts no less, although with only Saif Ali Khan and Anil Kapoor as the now ex police inspector Robert D'Costa returning, but adopting a similar formula that focused on the con.You don't really need to watch the first film because everything pretty much moved along in standalone fashion in this follow up, which spent a considerable part of the first half hour cementing the nastiness of brother-sister team Armaan (John Abraham) and Elena (Deepika Padukone). One's a street fighter who has never lost a fight, and brought out of the scene by Elena, the brains of their enduring and successful partnership, dabbling into various cons from casino tables, to just about owning an empire both in the light, and in the shady underworld. They form a formidable team, and individually, Shiraz Ahmed's story shows just how bad ass each can be, never batting an eyelid if they have to rely on good old fashioned murder or seduction to get at what they want.We're soon introduced to another new character played by Jacqueline Fernandez as Omisha, a thief who soon hooks up with Armaan not only because of his good looks but more importantly, his wealth and wicked demeanor, while Ranvir enters the picture to try and gain trust from the ruthless siblings to take on a larger con together, with Elena sending out her foxy signals right from the start. For a Bollywood movie, this covers the romance angle where the leads have their counterparts to woo, or in this case accelerated into the expected song and dance sequence in lieu of something more kinky that can't be shown on screen.But really, things just aren't that simple, where soon Ranvir gets involved with both women, though for different reasons, and has an objective and motivation that ties in with a key character from the past, as well as to answer the rather open ended prologue in this film. To say a lot more is to ruin the surprises that Abbas-Mastan have in store for audiences. This is a Race movie that has qualities to be expanded into yet another Bollywood franchise of rotating villains played by a top star for each installment, going along the Dhoom route. So expect that things will never be as they seem, and there's almost always a motive behind what someone will say and do, where loyalties can shift at will, and one-upmanship is the order of the game.Which happens to be the film's weakness as well. Sometimes the flip-flopping extracts a chunk of imagination, coincidence and stretches one's belief that the con actually began many steps beforehand, like a chess grandmaster playing against an amateur, that surprises spring out from the blue, with constant smirking that one got on top of the other, only for that smirk to be wiped out by an even larger wink. It can get tongue-in-cheek at times, and opened up loopholes that would be best glossed over for the entire narrative to work. Heavy reliance on sleight of hand techniques also called for plot convenience, with its fragmented narrative style forced to hide, and then present details of the con.Heavy reliance on CG is also telling, but here the CG still seemed rather cartoony, which suited the hyper-reality style of the world that the characters in Race exists in. It's entertainment for the masses, so Abbas-Mastan waste no time in plying implausible stunts in every death-defying escape, although a parkour sequence was expertly handled. Set action pieces get bigger as the film moved along, culminating in a really nutty climatic showdown thousands of feet in the air. It's one thing presenting large set action pieces, but another in presenting them well no matter how cheesy it would be. Someone forgot to tell the filmmakers to ease up on the cheesiness, but perhaps they had comedy in mind as well, with a key unintentional one given gossip rags on the John Abraham-Bipasha Basu relationship that will have audiences in stitches.John Abraham's hulking frame got put to good use, and in what would be the usual Salman- Khan style, there's built-in opportunity here for clothes to be shed in a stylized MMA caged fight, for some brawn to be added rather than to put him in a role whose character is only interested in whatever it takes to make money, and horde cash, in what would be a major negative role since his turn in the first Dhoom. Saif Ali Khan continues with the swagger and poser requirements as Ranvir from the first film, playing the ultimate conman now with a more personal vendetta at hand, and paired up yet again with Deepika Padukone for the umpteenth time. If anything, Deepika's role as Elena fit into the typical Bond girl role, in having little to do, little to add to the story, but there for the eye candy. And she carried off the lightweight role really well, as does Jacqueline Fernandez in yet another sequel of her career. Anil Kapoor is grossly underused here, if only to serve as the plot's conduit between characters, and spending most of his time with his character's secretary Cherry (Ameesha Patel), leering and spouting sexual innuendos.If movies with twists and turns at every other instant is your cup of tea, then Race 2 would be that popcorn entertainer you're looking for, with a good looking cast providing eye candy to wild away those two and a half hours.

The kingpin of these hooligans is Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes - son of famous actor John Cassavetes). Charlie Sheen plays Jake, the reincarnation of a slain victim (Jamie) of the town thugs. He appears out of nowhere and soon begins conversations with Packard Walsh's girlfriend, an action considered lethal. Soon a mysterious driver with an exotic, futuristic-looking car (the real-life Dodge-Chrysler Interceptor M4S) appears on the scene and begins drag-racing Packard's gang into the grave.This film gives us some great eighties in it's soundtrack which includes Robert Palmer and Billy Idol. It also gives a look at the popular ""punk"" look of the eighties in the character of Skank. I recently discovered that the Wraith's car was a real-life automobile. And only one original model was actually loaned from Chrysler. The other shots were of ""shell"" models, without engines, etc. During the filming of the good drag-race shots on the mountainsides outside of Tuscon, one of the crew members was killed and another critically wounded.I had some dislike for the film in the completely idiotic and helpless nature of Packard's thugs. In fact, I had a bit of trouble in believing the entire town's pacifisim towards Packard. There is one strange scene involving a sexual encounter between Packard and some local girl, where she thanks the sheriff for showing up. This just didn't add any credibility. But then again the whole movie is a bit incredible, especially the Wraith's car and its ability to keep that Windex shine after blowing up. And I never did figure out what the deal was with that one part that glowed at the end of every crash. More 80's sfx...? I chuckled for an instant though when I saw the Wraith enter Packard's warehouse in that ""spacesuit"" with what appeared to be a ""space shotgun"". What was the deal with that? I was beginning to think Jake's body was beamed aboard an alien ship before he died and now he was returning with their technology.A good story for the eighties, but not one to take too seriously. Be sure to admire Sherilyn Fenn's teeny character, Keri. Oh, I also read you can buy an M4S Interceptor replica for about $70,000. Ouch! 6/10",neutral,movie
98796,"I never review, but I was reading reviews before renting this and thought I should give my input. I don't particularly enjoy any of Costner's movies, I think he's wooden (or stone) in his delivery and I never recognized anything about Dances with Wolves that made me think ""Academy Award"". Anyway, i rented this with a lack of anything else Blu- ray to rent and it wasn't THAT bad. It's certainly not ""worst movie ever"" or ""torpid"", but also not ""best horror"" by any means.I thought it was better than most of the movies you can get on your Netflix instant queue, it was out before AppleTV got it, etc. Costner was his usual self, but I bought it more than in any of his other movies, the two kids did well and the story wasn't a bunch of crap to me. So, honestly, if you're not looking for a movie to pan, a way top bad mouth Costner (which I have done on numerous occasions to anyone), this isn't too bad. There's a LOT worse to watch out there.I haven't read the short story this is based on, but I can imagine the ending isn't what it first was. Like someone on the message board posted, there have got be a lot of alternate endings out there, at least one that was, well, better than this one.Overall (from a Costner disliker): not too bad, could've been better (give it an R and go for that Descent type feel I think they were trying to capitalize on), could've been worse (Waterworld, Prince of Thieves, anything ever touched by Uwe Boll).",neutral,movie

98823,"Well January in film has pretty much come and gone and I have to say that I'm surprised that I've enjoyed most of the films that have come out this year thus far. Wasn't really looking forward to this film that was a child friendly rendition of a modern day King Arthur but I gave it a go. Its really dumb at times as expected but is entertaining enough to warrant its own existence. I do hope to not have any more film adaptation of Arthurian legend for a while though.The film is about a kid named Alexander who one day stumbles on the legendary Excalibur sword. This event unleashes Morgana, an enchantress who is looking to gain access to the sword. To stop her and her soldiers, Alexander enlists the help of an unlikely trio while receiving aid and guidance from the ancient wizard, Merlin. The film stars the son of Andy Serkis and the always gorgeous Rebecca Ferguson (except not when she transforms in this film).The running length of this film is too long especially for a children's movie. These types of films should clock in at a max of an hour and a half. The effects of the film were pretty decent and the characters were good enough to keep you watching their plight. Its a modern day re-imaging of the successor to the sword and the stone which I find the younger crowd could really enjoy.There isn't a whole lot of good or bad in this film, it meets its mark in the middle. Its an introduction to Louis Ashbourne Serkis, who I am sure we will see more of in the future. Also, its a chance to see Rebecca Ferguson who really needs to be in more things because she's super great. Overall, don't expect anything more than what the trailers show you but its a perfectly fine film that will go over well with the younger viewers.6.5/10",neutral,movie
98866,"Low concept (nothing new but all in). High budget (a lot of fairly expensive scenes). Great casting (a handful of real life Hollywood survivors). Not always funny but a few times over-the-top hilarious. Sweet, but mostly in an after-school-special way. Outtakes over the credits are a nice bonus. A poor man's La La Land (looked to be all filmed in L.A.). While waiting for this screening I spent 30 minutes watching The Zookeeper's Wife, so I had movies-as-serious-stuff whiplash. I predict that this won't be a crossover hit, but will turn a small profit (as it deserves to). Worth my time and senior discount ticket, but if you don't like silly pick something else.

Such a character has a fantastic potential to create a wonderful story.However, the story was sub par, the other characters cardboard and so many opportunities were missed out again and again. If I were to rate this film on the characters, I would have to give an 8 or even 9 to Brosnan's, but something close to 3 for Jessica Alba's. Salma Hayek's wasn't a lot better either and Malcolm McDowell, as the father, was 0-dimensional! I understand old actors get fewer jobs, but have you seen any of this guy's films? Can't you see how much better he could have been if given some good material?Bottom line: it's an American Britspoitation film, based entirely on Pierce Brosnan's charm, with a little bit of McDowell sprinkled in the cast to get old people like me interested.

99007,"I saw this film on AMC and part way through it, I felt as if I had seen it before. Then I realized I was thinking of the 1990 Penny Marshall film ""Awakenings,"" starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.""At First Sight"" is a true story about a blind man who temporarily regains his sight, then goes blind again. ""Awakenings"" was about a comatose man who woke up temporarily, then slid back into a comatose.Oh, and by the way, they're both written by the same guy.For what it's worth, ""Love At First Sight"" is actually a pretty likable and overall watchable film. It's not great or anything unpredictable (how convenient - the female love interest) but Kilmer gives a remarkable performance (all considered) and there are a few moments in hte film that are a BIT out of the ordinary.Worth watching, but don't go out of your way or anything.",neutral,movie

While I won't disagree with them (it's a decent movie), I cannot fully share their enthusiasm. The movie is excellently shot (moody if you want to call it that) and has a stellar cast. But I never felt that it went places (no pun intended) or had the upper hand on other, similar movies.One of them being ""The Divide"", which I thought had some interesting ideas and was also confined in an area, but was also more compact and more suspenseful overall. The movie on hand is good too and if you like your end of the world thriller to have some drama and action mixed in, this won't disappoint you.

99179,"""You ever going to Tahiti like Paul Gauguin? I don't know.""If there's something Travolta remained loyal to, then surely it's his distinctive, sad look. Ever since I saw him the first time appearing in ""Saturday Night Fever"" (ages ago), he uses that sad expression. It always looks as if he's going to burst out in tears. And the movie""The Forger"" is substantively perfect for retrieving that typical facial expression at the right time. A film about a convicted forger who turned his back at his former profession. And at the same time he's a concerned father who would do anything to be with his son the short time that's left. And that's where this movie fails a bit. Does the emphasis lie on the father-son relationship or was it the intention to make a crime story? The final result is a mix of these two, with the result that both aspects feel like semi-finished.Raymond J. Cutter (John Travolta) is a notorious forger of art works and is about to be released earlier because of a deal with a thug called Keegan (Anson Mount). In this way he can spend some time with his son Will (Tye Sheridan), a petite teenager whose future doesn't look so rosy after they've discovered a brain tumor. To say the very least, the relationship between Will and his father isn't too good. Also between Raymond and his father (Christopher Plummer), who took care of Will during Raymond's absence, there are some disputes. The additional problem is that Keegan expects something in return from Raymond, namely forging a valuable, world famous painting from Monet.Now, I'm not an art expert but I don't think you can forge a Monet painting in such a short time period. I'm sure you don't really need high-tech methods to determine from the outset if the painting hanging on the wall is authentic or recently painted. But my gut feeling says that this aspect of ""The Forger"" is irrelevant and that it's just used as an entertaining way to introduce the father-son relationship. Would Travolta be a professional dancer in this film, and he and his son had to participate in a renowned competition together (where Travolta could show his famous 70s dance moves once again) this would have yielded the same result. Commercially, the result would probably be disappointing. So we throw in a bit of mystery and crime (where Travolta can demonstrate his tough side again and beat up some bouncers with a baseball bat) to make it more attractive.Although it looks a lot like a typical movie, at times the acting transcends the average. Especially the moments between father and son are beautifully played with vulnerability and regret getting the upper hand. That it eventually turns into a collaboration between father and son, is a bit far-fetched. Plummer also shines at times and shows he's perfectly suited for a character part. Even Travolta demonstrates that he has more to offer than just watching sad all the time. The loss of his son Jett most likely has something to do with his rendition looking so realistic. Maybe he decided to give this role a try as a therapeutic decision, in order to put a painful period in the past.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",neutral,movie

I would've preferred the sea creatures to be more grotesque but that wasn't what they were aiming for. This film doesn't explain everything which leaves you thinking about it which works well in this case.

Still, it's a fun romance and an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.The tale revolves around two rival Chicago reporters, one relatively novice, Sabrina Peterson, the other the more seasoned, well known Peter Brackett, who are both hot on the trail of a train derailment story. Of course competition between them is intense (and so at times is the chemistry) as the two exchange false leads, fibs, barbs, and witty repartee. Lots of predictable action, chases, and mystery as to the identity of the bad guys.The lovely, always endearing Julia Roberts plays the journalistic sharp cookie, Sabrina, with Nick Nolte convincing in the role of her rival, Brackett. At least the pair are not hopping into bed within the first half hour (in refreshing contrast to most modern films), leaving a little time for storytelling and character development.This is definitely describable as a ""flick"" (for guys or chicks); its spirit is in keeping with its title. Personally, I'm a great Julia Roberts fan. This isn't her best picture but, nevertheless, it's quite watchable.",neutral,movie

There's nothing to brag about in the acting, though Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern do a nice job. 2. The script is just okay, and holds back what could have been a much better film.Positives:1. There are so few movies that focus on marriage, getting married, having a baby, living with your kids, or even a gut-wrenching divorce. I appreciate when a filmmaker takes on these subjects, which touch a lot of the population, but rarely are addressed in film. They are powerful subjects to which many, many people relate. However, the lion's share of films deal with meeting somebody and getting together--at most going to a proposal--but they don't deal with anything that follows that. This movie covers what follows, and anyone who has been through it can relate to the various issues through which you go in a normal relationship like this. 2. The labor and delivery segment of the film was pretty well done, and I enjoyed it a lot.Recommendation:Watch this movie, since there are so few movies that deal with the subject matter.The movie ""Marley and Me"" (Owen Wilson & Jennifer Aniston) actually deals with all these things much better, with better acting and a better script. I know, that's a dog movie, but it's really not – it's really a movie about getting married, beginning careers, living as a married couple, and having kids. Other good movies in this category are ""The War of the Roses"" (Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner), ""Price Check"" (Eric Mabius & Parker Posey), Regarding Henry"" (Harrison Ford & Annette Benning), and ""The Story of Us"" (Bruce Willis & Michelle Pfeiffer).",neutral,movie

This is a niche studio which already has adoring fans and it's understandable to have a sense of belonging and familiarity.

Since each man has respective piece, they have to wield them as a team to prevail. The premise is silly from the first place, one is better off not questioning and just roll with it. There's a sizable effort and adoration for the sci-fi genre, even though not all elements pan out, the mold fits the quirkiness quite well just for the sake of entertainment.This is not a large budget production, yet it looks good when it needs to and the trademark video game vibe is appreciable. There's surprisingly a good characterization for the so called Lazer Team, even though they might not be appealing from the start. Two or three moments surpass its rowdy nut-busting nature, and if it's a story of underdog fighting for glory, there's an identifiable aspect to the theme.What ruins the production most of the time is the deadpan acting. The four main leads perform erratically, one might look like he's reading from Youtube comments, while another is shouting profusely. They don't really have any chemistry, furthermore it will impact the jokes revolving slapstick, making them dull and repetitive.If they could find the balance between corny fun and appropriate acting, Lazer Team might be more than a simple popcorn flick, although the light comedic nature is acceptably decent as well.",neutral,movie

The group has internal strife and ambition for riches, but none of their story is fully fleshed out. The motives or back stories, even for the antagonist role, are often glossed over. Furthermore, the movie introduces many typical characters such lost princess and the enigmatic priest, each with their own equally monotonous issue.With stack of characters, it's unfortunate that none of them is actually interesting. The actors work with passable acting, but the script is basically told while they are in constant running. It buries the story as they roar and slash their way through. When the supposed dramatic scenes play out, chances are audience wouldn't be invested on these characters.It does possess good visual, camera work and design. There are set pieces that offer decent skirmish, both in daylight or night time. Credit when credit is due, most movies with fantasy theme often become blurry as the fight continues after dawn, but Northmen gives good graphic and lighting even in these instances.

I am surprised that no one at all knows that the term is not only offensive, but completely inaccurate. Just an FYI, and I hope someone will read this and ""ALERT THE MEDIA""!! Thanks :) I don't usually base a review entirely on the use of an offensive word, or phrase but this is just so ridiculous, and I continue to hear it in so many films. Otherwise, Lola Versus is fun, quirky and over the top regarding sex,and her seemingly self loathing actions. The other characters are also really strange and quirky, but I think that is what makes it a decent film. It's like, we all know someone like them, albeit not quite so dramatic. There is a lot of irony in this film and some of the scenes are similar to the humor in Napolean Dynamite (which I loved), so that is not a bad thing. So, overall, funny film. If they could only edit out the deaf-mute part, it would be even better!",neutral,movie
100150,"Rich characters! Each character had a life a back story that I got to know enough of about. Usually I'm annoyed by narrative, it takes me out of the movie, but they weren't distracting at all. They were funny and smart and it was a creative way to get insight about the character instead of 'telling' dialog, which can get tedious. Love watching little films with a lot of everything: raw grit, action and heart. Milla was great, never seen her that emotional and focused. This was a 3-d performance for her. Read Gary Lenon's credits- good stuff for a directorial debut. He made efficient choices that tell the story. It's hard to do that the first time around. Didn't know Aisha Tyler was in it, another pleasant surprise. Her performance was subtle. The cast was authentic Big Al owned the role! I really liked this one.",neutral,movie
100161,"It started out good, there were a number of funny scenes like the old lady, and the deadpool guy cracked me up in lotta scenes, ie. ""war face"", I actually laughed pretty hard at that part.

100170,"A young widow and her two daughters move to a new house in a Pennsylvanian mountain town. Soon, her daughter's imaginary friend starts to let the family know she's just a little too real.This movie was enjoyable. I liked the characters (especially the older daughter and the neighbor Hanks) and the situations. The atmosphere was perfect and dark, as one would expect from a movie about zombies roaming through the woods. And the pacing was decent, revealing the story in a good speed.The gore was decent: not over-the-top, but not ignored. Entrails are eaten and heads are smashed in. Sure, it's not as cool as ""Necromantic"" or ""Anthropophagus"", but it's alright. (Actually, since most of the film was so blah and standard fare, this Goldilocks level of gore should be no surprise.) Some blood scenes were welcome and I could have used more.But this film is also riddled with countless clichés. An imaginary friend who might be real. Single mom with daughters moves to new town. Vehicles that won't start. Tripping in the middle of a running scene. I could probably go on.Some good can be said. Chloe Moretz is really blossoming into a supreme actress, and this early work deserves to be seen. Scout Taylor-Compton is another genre favorite. And the DVD has audio commentary with director J. S. Cardone and actress Lori Heuring (though I haven't listened to it yet), so that's an extra treat for those who do enjoy the film.I found the movie too ""polished"": the target seemed to be Hollywood and teenage girls, rather than those who would go to see a film festival called ""8 Films to Die For"" (which is where I saw this). The dirty, gritty scenes were just too clean. Sure, the movie was dark... but dark in a very sanitary way. (There are better ways to word this, but I don't know what they are.) If you don't see this film, that's fine. More than likely it will fade into the background and within a few years won't even be found on video store shelves. You'll see it on Netflix and be like ""what is this?"", but don't bother ordering it... for all the film lacks, it will probably lack even more in a few years as it becomes stale (if it hasn't already).",neutral,movie
100271,"Once upon a time, there was a film director known as Tobe Hooper. This man roared his way into the hearts of horror fans in 1974 with the cult classic that top's many a fans all time list of horror movies; The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Since then, however, Hooper's career has been a constant downward spiral, and in spite of a Spielberg produced ghost story and a sequel to his brilliant debut, Hooper has never managed to get out of his rut. This remake of the 70's trash 'classic' ensures that he still hasn't managed to claw his way out. Don't get me wrong, though, this actually isn't a bad film; but it's very run of the mill, and Hooper's handling leaves a lot to be desired. The reason for this, mainly, is due to the fact that Hooper obviously wanted this movie to be more than it is. All a horror fan expects from a film like this is brutal and gory murders, and the film has them - but it also has the bits in between, and Hooper's attempts to make them interesting fail on every level. The film moves at snail pace between the murders, and all I wanted was another death scene all the time. And that's not good when you're watching what is supposed to be a thriller.As mentioned; the death scenes definitely are good; and the film makes best use of it's title. People are beaten to death with hammers, gored with drills and someone even gets the top half of their head sliced off with an electric sander. And let's not forget my personal favourite implement of death - the nail-gun! It's a shame that Hooper didn't find room for a chainsaw, though. The film has a very polished look throughout, which doesn't do the film many favours as it's supposed to be a remake of a gritty 70's slasher; but on the other hand, it does look nice so you've got to take the rough with the smooth. The plot starts to fall apart towards the end too, as throughout you get the impression that the film is trying to give you a line up of possible suspects; only for the mystery to fall completely flat on it's face at the film's conclusion. Still, while this film isn't all the good; nor is it even a top example of the genre, it's worth a watch and if you like to waste your time; there's worse films for you to waste it on than this.",neutral,movie

Then again, she may not want them to. Time has been surprisingly kind to this reworking of 1940's ""One Million B.C."" The special effects are very good, the wilds of prehistoric nature are often excitingly, colorfully captured, and handsome John Richardson is charismatic as a caveman who, along with Welch, ditches his tribe to set out on a personal journey. Yes, it's Raquel in a fur-bikini that most people will remember, but a good time is had by all. **1/2 from ****",neutral,movie
100535,"Like most of you, I am a Harry Potter fan and stumbled upon this movie while seeing what Rupert Grint was up to. I thought he was easily the most talented actor of the trio, and was curious to where his career would go - Emma Watson has modeling and fashion, Dan Radcliffe seems to be doing Broadway and other types of media.Anyway, The movie is centered around two best friends - Malachy (Grint) and Luke (Sheehan). They live a regular yet drug-infused life of a teenager. Malachy is a loved son with responsibility and a job. Luke, however, is the product of a broken home and as a result is left by himself for the most part - fueling the chaos. Malachy's boss' daughter, Michelle, comes to live with him and the two friends immediately fight for her. The love between the friends is obvious throughout the movie, despite frequent fights. Malachy ends up falling for Michelle, and when she reveals she is leaving and therefore cannot start a relationship he works harder for even a moment of love. The ending is pretty surprising, a solid twist.I didn't like the directing at all. Throughout the movie there is white text that flashes across the screen with phrases that don't seem to make sense. Are they the character's thoughts? words? Narrator's hints? It was unnecessary. The writing was pretty good, a lot of things were unnecessary and unexplained, but some can argue that is just a style that was intentional - perhaps even liked by many viewers. The ending sort of drops off, leaving unclear of the fate of the trio. Again, it may be intentional, but it was far too abrupt and didn't close the movie in the way I would have liked.The highlight of this movie is the acting. Without a doubt. Every person in this movie is believable and brilliant. Grint did not disappoint and played the character flawlessly. Even when he is not the focus of the shot, he stays in character and even his gestures are consistent and spot on. Sheehan was the biggest surprise to me. I have no idea who he is, haven't seen him before, but he really made the movie for me. The mix of charisma, a character with a chip on his shoulder, and the overall development of his character is apparent with every word, gesture, and smirk. I look forward to seeing him in future films.Overall, if you are a Harry Potter fan, you will appreciate Grint's performance and probably like the movie. The acting made the shortcomings of the movie less obvious and entertaining. However, this is not a movie meant for a young audience. It is riddled with drugs, sex, violence, and bad language.",neutral,movie
100647,"I thought this movie was OK... I mean it was everything I would've expected, but from the previews they kind of gave most of it away... the story never left its predictable plot line. The actors... well... they were OK... it wasn't 2007's golden globe nominee performance... if you know what I mean. So there's the whole boxing thing and then he finds his heart in double dutch... yea... OK... and of course they win the competition in the end and everyone's merry or whatever... But you know you can't really expect much from typical Disney movies... I thought it was realistic... at points... and it was a great story... but... shall I say... BORING? Keke Palmer is a great actress... and she was OK in this movie too... but it wasn't her best. Same for Corbin Bleu. Don't get me wrong, the movie was good... non-original... but GOOD... Just WAAAYYY WAAAAAY too predictable. For those of you who haven't seen this yet, you're not in for a mind-boggling story. Ugh, I mean it was decent and enjoyable...

100648,"A family of three (Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton and Jessica Dollarhide) have inherited a castle, but have no plans to stay on. So they take inventory in order to sell off the property. But they aren't the only living relatives -- in the basement is the ""castle freak"", a deformed cannibal chained to the dungeon. If he gets loose, the family's heritage may become one of pure carnage.Stuart Gordon (""Re-Animator"") directs this film with a cast consisting of Jeffrey Combs (""Re-Animator"") and Barbra Crampton (""Re-Animator""), produced by Charles Band (""Re-Animator""). Maybe you've caught on, but this is something of a ""Re-Animator"" reunion... with a few people missing. And a much lower production value (the film quality looks like 1970s issue or something from PBS during British comedy hour). For the most part, this is pretty solid film.Combs is quite good, and one wonders why he's not given leading roles more often. Crampton is also good, and the blind girl (Jessica Dollarhide, in her only feature film) was remarkable. The freak? I have to say the makeup, effects and even the mannerisms were impressive. There's a scene where a prostitute meets her end... and they really went out of their way to show how horrific the freak could be.The story isn't fast-paced or action-packed, so if you need to be constantly entertained, this may not be for you. But if you like a good development in your plot, I think you'd appreciate this lost treasure (definitely one of the lesser-seen Gordon horror films). I wasn't paying as close attention as I should have been, because I was half in the bag from drinking Scoresby Scotch (it's the connoisseur's Scotch)... but it kept me feeling pretty good.

100684,"We now see Mr Gere get tough as Eddie Jillete (dig the name, and he's not much of a shaver either), another Chicago cop who doesn't play by the rules. Opening with a funny stake out scene, with Gere and partner, who winds up dead, later, of course, (ooops! sorry to ruin it for ya) posing as car wash attendants, where they nab these two snitches, which leads to a higher chain of really bad dudes, who are part of a drug syndicate. Gere's partner being slayed, along with a contact supplier, has him on an adrenaline filled quest of revenge, (an excuse for the rest of the movie) that sees him travelling to the bayou, to find the mysterious and beautiful Michelle, the contact's girlfriends, who Gere doesn't mind slapping if, if slapped first as seen earlier, before all the bloodshed started. Gere's need for vengeance, is not a bad excuse, for a few reasons- you've got the beautiful Basinger, and a great action sequence that sees Gere and Basinger scarcely escaping the claws of the merciless head honcho, (Jerome Krabbe, an evily brilliant, masterful performance, way above his peers) fleeing across the river, from out of the pilings, and ending up in the swamps of Louisiana, drained, thirsty and hungry as hell. Personally, not buying the probability of them getting away clean like this, I also got drained watching them. The other reason besides Gere, purposely pranging the car of the contact's brother, who wasn't playing ball in the Q and A department, was the shootout scene in the abandoned hotel. Get this. Gere gave the proprietor a bunch of money for all the rooms, telling him ""There's no future in it"". The proprietor leaves as simply as that before Gere rigs the hotel with traps and guns. It is a great set up of tense atmosphere, before Gere has his moment of vengeance face to face with killer Krabbe. While really becoming a fan of Gere in the mid eighties, No Mercy, isn't one I held in memory. It was a good actioner, at viewing time, but nothing really stuck with me about it. A few weeks later it was totally forgettable, the only part, sticking with me, in those small weeks after, was them going through the mire and the swamps. Gere did bring out an intriguing new tough guy, unruly, who's disrespectful of women, he really needs a lesson in manners, and like the movie, his character wasn't one, you much cared about.",neutral,movie
100701,"With most of the action taking place on the plane I did find this one a little claustrophobic, but then again I guess that might have been intentional. A small budget can't have helped too much either. Decent performances all round, although nobody really stood out, so honourable mentions go to; Scarlett Alice Johnson as Jo, Jack Gordon as Max, Michael Jibson as Dave, Elen Rhys as Gwen and Joshua Richards as Alligator.Although I did find it quite compelling I felt quite detached from the characters. I guess I didn't care about them enough for the film to have any great impact. It's quite well made, given the constraints of the budget; I just felt it didn't quite have enough to make me rave about it. It does flag a little about half way through and I found the ending slightly predictable.

Apparently in today's America helping your family means buying them stuff. Sam's love for her children barely extends beyond buying stuff for them which is probably where America is going wrong in the first place. Hewitt's performance center's around her unusual skills at satisfying her clients which apparently is the only thing her client's wives want to know in a later scene. Her husbands behavior is just as bizarre when he discovers what it is his wife is actually doing at her ""Day Job"". When did men start crying instead of doing what is more natural? The characters around Sam are just not that believable and even less so when Sam's mother says ""it is partly my fault"". When did a mother ever say that? The final punishment for Sam;s behavior and her redemption are both as ridiculous as the almost Disneyesque ""Only for Mature viewers"" plot line. if this is the 80's someone should pinch me so I can wake up.

Nice framing and editing as well. You can watch it once and it will do it's job, even if you start thinking about the things that just seem to happen conveniently.There are logical errors and you might argue that the moral is a bit too much, but then again this could also be called nit-picking.

100859,"The course of our lives is determined by the countless decisions - both major and minor - we make on a daily basis. So much so that one simple and seemingly insignificant act of choice can set the course for our entire future, including where we'll go to school, who we'll wind up marrying, whether we'll be killed crossing that street or live another fifty years because we took a different route entirely. That is the theme explored in ""Uncertainty,"" a dual-level drama produced, written and directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel.The movie opens with a young couple - played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lynn Collins - standing on the Brooklyn Bridge, obviously on the brink of making some major decision regarding their future. After a coin flip, one heads in one direction (to Manhattan) and one in the other (to Brooklyn), leading the couple to have distinctly different experiences in what might be thought of as parallel universes. In the Manhattan-based scenario, Bobby and Kate, dressed in yellow, are plunged into a bizarre cloak-and-dagger tale set off by the finding of a cell phone in the back of a cab (a bit like ""24"" if it were made on an indie-film budget); the other direction leads to a more mundane domestic drama wherein the lovers, dressed in green, celebrate the 4th of July with Kate's family, including the overly critical mother who drives the young woman crazy with her negativity and interference.The different-paths-equals-different-outcomes theme has been explored before, most notably in 1998's ""Sliding Doors,"" but here the why and the wherefore of it all seems to have eluded the filmmakers - as it does us. Each storyline is interesting enough in its own right - and the acting and direction are first-rate throughout - but they fail to come together in any kind of a meaningful way. They literally run along parallel tracks, with no point of convergence from which we can deduce a point - unless it's that bright yellow is probably not the best fashion choice when you're trying to outrun a hit man.Moreover, the movie doesn't lay down the ground rules for the scenario in a very coherent or consistent fashion. The synopsis for the film says that the couple uses the coin flip to determine how they're going to spend that holiday weekend. Yet, it's obviously much more complicated than that, for in one version, Kate is pregnant, but in the other she isn't (or, at least, it's never mentioned). In one, she is the star of a Broadway play; in the other, she says she works at a restaurant. And the two couples obviously live in different parts of town. Perhaps, consistency really is the hobgoblin of little minds and we should be looking at the larger picture here, but, all the same, the movie leaves us with a lot of unanswered questions, which may not necessarily be a bad thing, but it can make for a frustrating experience at times.I recommend watching ""Uncertainty"" for the risks it takes and the mood it sets (Peter Nashel's evocative score is very helpful in that regard) but, when it comes right down to it, the movie seems a commendable but over-elaborate effort at stating the obvious.",neutral,movie

If you are out digging a grave at 5.am., bawling your eyes out, then you know what someone goes through when they lose a pet.So, I could empathize with Peggy (Molly Shannon) and see how she could be easily swayed by Newt (Peter Sarsgaard). She was vulnerable and was easily pushed over the deep end.It is unrealistic to think that friends, family, and co-workers will be so understanding.

100993,"After watching the film I read some interviews with the writer/director Lucile Hadihalilović and she mentioned how it had taken her a long time to get funding for this film. Never have I been less surprised. Not creepy enough to be a full blown horror film and too creepy to just be a pure art film.The film is about a young pre-pubescent boy named Nicolas who lives on a remote island with his mother, several other women and other young boys around his age. He is told he is sickly by his mother and urged to eat a really wicked looking blue creation for his ""health"" and eventually has to go to a hospital where he is repeatedly operated on.I won't spoil the movie, but Hadihalilović isn't one for jump scares and Nicolas's illness and the reason for his hospital visits are made clear very early on. It all unfolds in a creepy atmospheric way so that the audience is aware of the bad things that are going on before Nicolas is, though he too learns the secret behind his illness soon enough. The movie is very beautifully filmed with lots of stunning shots of the water and the seaside. However one thing I take issue with is how dark some of the shots were. Maybe it was the fault of the distributor for not cleaning up the shots but there are some nightime scenes where instead of being frightened I was merely confused because the screen looked pitch black. Nevertheless the movie is very easy to follow on and the ultimate story and horror is pretty simple. I'm not a horror fan so this was not really a movie for me, but for art fans who are looking for a slow scare, this might be for you.",neutral,movie

Of course, I do not doubt that women audience will delve deeper into the movie and the characters portrayed herein, as the main characters are all female and the story follows their struggles to cope with the situations that life deal them.The cast was nice, and they all portrayed their characters well, bringing them to life on the screen. You get a lot of story to each character so you can immerse yourself in their situations. Every character of the story brings with her (or him) something unique and touching to the story. The way the characters are brought to life is made in a real believable manner, so you can easy identify yourself with these people.All story lines entwined well on the screen and there was a wholesome feeling to the entire movie. And the movie deals with real life situations, situations that we all can related to on one level or another.

It's also because I'm glued to the addiction of low-budget movies while staying away from our cultural mainstream.

As a simple little exploitation film, it's just like spending the night at the local drive-in, eating stale popcorn and kissin' the girls until the final curtain.

The beginning was rather odd with the star as a little girl whose deafness to her grandfathers recommendations didn't bode well for a long life. The dreaded rape scene wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be, considering what some twisted directors have done with the subject.

She is killed at an animal house type of party by the typical drunken sociopath frat boys. She wakes up dead between heaven and hell and must fight for her soul using vague clues given to her by dead relatives and a guardian angel of sorts.

Horror Hotel will particularly appeal to anyone who loves camp. It is great escapist entertainment and is the sort that is best enjoyed over a pizza and a few drinks with a group of friends. It's clear that this is not a big budget production but the film makers have made great use of the resources they had. The special effects are well done and the acting, editing and sound are solid.

Meanwhile the outcast high-school student Sara Wexler (Meredith Henderson) tries to commit suicide on the road and is hit by the Sheriff Berger's car. While bringing Sara in the same ambulance that is transporting the body of Chambers to the hospital, the teenager sees the dead coming back to life. In the hospital, Sara shares the room with the stabbed teenager Walter (Nathan Stenphenson) that coincidentally is her schoolmate, and she asks him to help her to leave the hospital. She tells what she saw, but Walter in principle believe Sara is nuts. However, when he sees blood on the corridor, he helps Sara to escape from their room. However, they find that all exits are locked and they are trapped in the hospital while the psychopath is slaughtering the patients and staff looking for Sara.""Heartstopper"" is flawed and predictable, but is not a bad low-budget horror movie. The gore story has the usual clichés of the genre, but I have found it entertaining in the end. The greatest attraction is certainly Robert Englund that has a minor participation. However, the sexy Meredith Henderson, Nathan Stenphenson and James Binkley have good performance the result is OK. The way Sara defeats the demon in the storm is not reasonable and gives a weak conclusion to the plot. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Devorador de Almas"" (""Souls Devour"")",neutral,movie
101404,"Having just seen this film for the second time in some years I felt I needed to come to its defense in view of the poor ratings it has received on IMDb. Moreover I can't help but compare it to ""Rebel Without a Cause"" which I also recently saw again. Released nine years apart they both deal with the same subject, disaffected youth. They also both reflect their times. Whereas ""Rebel"" dances around young angst, ""Kitten"" is more honest about it, although nowhere near as raw as it would have been done today. In ""Rebel"" the kids are troubled but still seek comfort from their parents, in ""Kitten"" they're nihilistic, rebellious, disdainful of their parents' values. ""Kitten"" is edgy, mean, gritty. Its poverty-row production probably helped in that respect. The limited sets added to the sense of claustrophobia, the fear of exposing a dangerous secret in the open. And the references to the finality of the atom bomb add to the general sense of despair.I found the acting competent if not outstanding. All protagonists had their highs and lows and overall they acquitted themselves rather well, even John Forsythe who does tend to be one-dimensional. I even think that may have worked in his favor playing a conflicted middle-aged man whose estranged wife is away, suddenly being confronted with a sexually charged dynamo. It seems such a man would be on the introverted side. And his suspicious attitude hinted at something sinister. After all, if he had nothing to hide, wouldn't he have reached out for help? He had plenty of opportunities but wasted them all, to the very end, when Ann-Margret walks back to the car and takes away his car keys.One final note: Audrey Dalton had the most thankless part. She had not even one single line, no screen time at all. We only get to see her in a photo soon to be vandalized. And when Forsythe goes to buy size seven clothes for Ann-Margret we are told that Dalton's character would never fit in them. That's rather unkind because I think she's actually smaller than Ann-Margret. So to top it all off she has to suffer the indignity of being called fat, or at least big, and she doesn't get the chance to show us otherwise. Then again maybe that's just it, she doesn't have any screen time because the whole clothes scene wouldn't fit in.",neutral,movie
101594,"Irwin Allen's production of 'The Story of Mankind' has been called one of the worst films ever made, a film so bad that it has NEVER been released on video, and barely ever appears on television (and only then in a VERY abbreviated form.) This is UNFAIR! While the film is intentionally (and sometimes unintentionally) campy, it has many milestones that make it worthy of respect. First, it is Ronald Colman's final film (he died a year after the release), and he still shows the urbanity, the kindness, and the 'voice' that made him unique. Second, it is the last theatrical appearance of the Marx Brothers (although they appear separately), and Harpo plays the harp one last time, a bittersweet experience. Third, Vincent Price plays the Devil, and certainly no actor is more perfect for the role! Fourth, the film foreshadows Irwin Allen's later work, on television ('Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea', 'Time Tunnel') and in film ('The Poseidon Adventure', 'The Towering Inferno'). There are other milestones to this film, as well, but I think you can see my point!The story is VERY loosely based on Henrik Van Loon's wonderful, witty history of the human race (which is a fabulous read, if you ever get the chance!) The 'basic' framework of the story has been changed into an 'End of the World' tale, set in the heavens. High Judge Cedric Hardwicke must decide whether or not Earth should be allowed to blow itself up, after the creation of a 'super' bomb. Two counsels are selected; for the Prosecution is the Devil (Vincent Price), sly and sarcastic, and pleased that God's ultimate creation has fallen on it's face; for the Defense is the Spirit of Mankind (Ronald Colman), an entity that carries the essence of all of Man's achievements, both good and bad.As both sides present their cases, the 'history' of the world is played out, using Warner Brothers' stock footage and guest star cameos. Among the most memorable of these cameos are Virginia Mayo as a vampy Cleopatra, Peter Lorre, a lazily derranged Nero, Hedy Lamarr as a pious Joan of Arc, Harpo Marx miming Sir Issac Newton, Groucho Marx leering and wisecracking as Peter Minuit, buying Manhattan Island, and Dennis Hopper as a WAY over-the-top young Napoleon!Throughout the proceedings, Price and Colman (who had appeared together seven years earlier, in 'Champagne for Caesar') trade barbs over Man's worthiness, in exchanges both funny and sadly true, at times!'The Story of Mankind' is NOT classic cinema, but it is fun, and has a kind of charm uniquely it's own. It should NOT be forgotten!",neutral,movie
101603,"Barney Chavez (Burr) is in-love with Mrs. Dina Van Gelder (Payton) but she is married to his employer. Chavez ends up killing the employer but is seen by a voodoo priestess who casts a spell, a curse, on him that turns him into a murderous Gorilla. Barney and Dina end up married but with lots of problems. Police Commissioner Taro (Chaney) is on the trail to find out the answers. The question is: Is Chavez' transformation into a Gorilla real or all in his mind.Raymond Burr is good in this role - convincing, Barbra Payton does well as a woman tormented, Lon Chaney Jr makes a good police commissioner - so the film is overall fun to watch.This film is not nearly as bad as the critics say it is - it's actually interesting. There are some intense moments and it's a good ending. If you like movies where one of the characters is transformed into a creature and film concerning voodoo then you might like 'Bride of the Gorilla'.6.5/10",neutral,movie
101732,"I bought this along with 9 other movies in a set from a $5 bin somewhere ... Honestly wasn't expecting anything, I just like to buy the sets and see how bad some can be. But this was one of those movies that was actually good. The beginning wasn't slow, but for some who like it to grab you right away please be patient. Gave me a few good jumps throughout the movies as well as the anticipation of something to come. I easily get bored and lose attention sometimes, but this had my attention the whole time.",neutral,movie
101830,"After a long hot summer, it's back to school for the students of Rosedale High, where an impending football game against arch rivals Hardin leads to a series of high-spirited pranks carried out by Rosedale's star players Jesse and Johnnie (Michael Mullins and Robert Carradine) and members of the sexy cheer-leading squad, the feisty pom pom shakers including lovely brunette Laurie (Jennifer Ashley) and pretty blonde Sally (Lisa Reeves).The Pom Pom Girls is a fairly typical slice of 70s teenage drive-in fodder, full of hot girls and hunky guys whose lives mainly revolve around their cars and who they're canoodling with in the back seat. It's clichéd and predictable stuff but achieves a certain lackadaisical charm thanks to an amiable cast and a suitably inconsequential approach to its plot—as the viewer, we have no idea where we're being taken, but we're still happy to go along for the ride.",neutral,movie
101901,"Movies are influenced not copied and in this case, well influenced and directed. John Abaraham debuted in ""Jism"" and it is amazing how far he has come in span of few movies. In ""Jism"" he was wooden, here he has great depth and range almost matching the Veteran Bachchan. Hindi movies have been dominated by actors like SRK, Salman Khan who have neither the looks nor the depth to portray the diversity required for an actor. Last decade the Indian Cinema has been cheated,orphaned and greatly deprived of this diversity-in the younger set-where as we always had feast from the older actors like Bachchan, Patekar, Om Puri, Amrish Puri-just to name a few. Actors like John Abraham are filling this gap and Actors like him have heightened interest in the otherwise dormant Hindi Cinema. The movie showcases incredible dueling between Abraham (Aryan) Bachchan (Doctor Trivedi) and his daughter (Bipasa Basu). Bachchan is indisputable Icon who has a commanding presence in any scene in any angle-a born actor like Pacino-where as Bipasha most of the time looks like she is hiding a secret (seductively I may add), but she does emote well when called for,unlike actors in her class Ash Rai; who looks good but the woman cannot act period-which can be a handicap for a director the caliber of Vikram Bhat.",neutral,movie

101939,"A vintage novel with a ""national treasure"" quality about it, and a movie version of it directed by Liv Ullman, Norway's passionate prodigy: Kristen Lavransdatter has an emblematic quality, like a national-theatre production attended by royalty.Sadly, the production does not quite live up to its own image: the star-crossed lovers more closely resemble a pedophile and his prey, or a sleazy playboy and his schoolgirl pick-up, than a knight and his lady. The wild passion at the heart of the picture would be a fizzle at a Christian am-dram camp.The big landowner, Kristen's dad, lives in a wretched shack with a couple of nags in the yard --- and his much older wife is nursing an age-old guilt, too. Basically, this whole tale is about guilt, which is a tedious theme, especially strung out for nearly three hours, and without even a few seconds of the forbidden sex being depicted, or skin being shown, which for a Scandinavian picture is, well, bewildering.Liv dutifully delivers her central, as-it-were feminist message: that daughters should always be allowed to shag whomever they wish, wherever, and whenever they choose, and probably at just about any age.Kristen fancied her childhood playmate, Arne, but was betrothed to Simon. A neighbour tries to rape her, but she dings him on the head with a heavy stone, deranging him sufficiently that in a rage he kills Arne. While attending a convent in Oslo (!) she takes a fancy to His Lordship, a rake who has wrecked the lives of many a dame, and is immediately hot to jump her. Ah, but he knows a trick or two with these schoolgirl virgins, and first lets her sleep the night in his lap while he strokes her hair ---- sure! After she's had a couple of lusty romps in the hay, Kristen may be racked by guilt, but she obeys her lust like a machine, and the devil take the hindmost. She's quite tickled when Mr Moneybags licks the hymen blood off her inner thigh, but that's it for the rampant sex as far as Ms. Ullman is concerned.Perhaps the weirdest moment in this theatrical-type movie is when Kristen watches her lover kill his other mistress of ten years, mother of six of his children, then marries him and falls adoringly into his arms in her father's bed. That's carrying Stepfordism to the Nth degree, in my opinion, and for most people in the audience, I think, rips the heroine away from normal and into the world of freaky Manson-girls.It's nice to know that the Norwegians treasure this picture, and believe its depiction of the medieval period, but out here in the wider world this film looks dated and Sunday schoolish. Even the art direction is overrated: the scenery is fairly impressive, but sparingly delivered, and the costumes out of a theatrical hire shop, and sometimes garishly coloured.Above all, this is a film about sexual desire and longing and rampant fulfilment, and for Kristen Lavransdatter not to depict any sexual activity at all is bordering on the perverted. This is a curiosity that is better left to the Norwegian board of education.",neutral,movie
101947,"I didn't know much about this new Brazilian movie before I watched it, though the title ""O Concurso"" (something like ""The Contest"" in English) had already given me an idea. In a country where public contests take place all over the year, here we see four men from different states competing one another for a job as a Federal Judge - the most coveted position among all public contests throughout the country. In the story, three of the contenders travel to Rio to do the exams. The fourth competitor is from Rio and he meets the trio in front of the Hall of Justice, where he invites the others to hang around and enjoy the beach. Despite the upcoming hard test they will do, they go with the dweller and a series of misadventures start to happen; some are really funny, others not very much. I laughed at some moments but at the end, it seemed to me like so many other comedies, from Brazil or from any other place - nothing new, just a few laughs without compromise.",neutral,movie
